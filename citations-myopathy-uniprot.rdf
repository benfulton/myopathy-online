<rdfs:comment>Myopathies are a clinically and etiologically heterogeneous group of disorders that can range from limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) to syndromic forms with associated features including intellectual disability. Here, we report the identification of mutations in transport protein particle complex 11 (TRAPPC11) in three individuals of a consanguineous Syrian family presenting with LGMD and in five individuals of Hutterite descent presenting with myopathy, infantile hyperkinetic movements, ataxia, and intellectual disability. By using a combination of whole-exome or genome sequencing with homozygosity mapping, we identified the homozygous c.2938G>A (p.Gly980Arg) missense mutation within the gryzun domain of TRAPPC11 in the Syrian LGMD family and the homozygous c.1287+5G>A splice-site mutation resulting in a 58 amino acid in-frame deletion (p.Ala372_Ser429del) in the foie gras domain of TRAPPC11 in the Hutterite families. TRAPPC11 encodes a component of the multiprotein TRAPP complex involved in membrane trafficking. We demonstrate that both mutations impair the binding ability of TRAPPC11 to other TRAPP complex components and disrupt the Golgi apparatus architecture. Marker trafficking experiments for the p.Ala372_Ser429del deletion indicated normal ER-to-Golgi trafficking but dramatically delayed exit from the Golgi to the cell surface. Moreover, we observed alterations of the lysosomal membrane glycoproteins lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) and LAMP2 as a consequence of TRAPPC11 dysfunction supporting a defect in the transport of secretory proteins as the underlying pathomechanism.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a congenital disorder caused by mutations of the myotubularin gene, MTM1. Myotubularin belongs to a large family of conserved lipid phosphatases that include both catalytically active and inactive myotubularin-related proteins (i.e., "MTMRs"). Biochemically, catalytically inactive MTMRs have been shown to form heteroligomers with active members within the myotubularin family through protein-protein interactions. However, the pathophysiological significance of catalytically inactive MTMRs remains unknown in muscle. By in vitro as well as in vivo studies, we have identified that catalytically inactive myotubularin-related protein 12 (MTMR12) binds to myotubularin in skeletal muscle. Knockdown of the mtmr12 gene in zebrafish resulted in skeletal muscle defects and impaired motor function. Analysis of mtmr12 morphant fish showed pathological changes with central nucleation, disorganized Triads, myofiber hypotrophy and whorled membrane structures similar to those seen in X-linked myotubular myopathy. Biochemical studies showed that deficiency of MTMR12 results in reduced levels of myotubularin protein in zebrafish and mammalian C2C12 cells. Loss of myotubularin also resulted in reduction of MTMR12 protein in C2C12 cells, mice and humans. Moreover, XLMTM mutations within the myotubularin interaction domain disrupted binding to MTMR12 in cell culture. Analysis of human XLMTM patient myotubes showed that mutations that disrupt the interaction between myotubularin and MTMR12 proteins result in reduction of both myotubularin and MTMR12. These studies strongly support the concept that interactions between myotubularin and MTMR12 are required for the stability of their functional protein complex in normal skeletal muscles. This work highlights an important physiological function of catalytically inactive phosphatases in the pathophysiology of myotubular myopathy and suggests a novel therapeutic approach through identification of drugs that could stabilize the myotubularin-MTMR12 complex and hence ameliorate this disorder.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dominant mutations in the alpha-B crystallin (CryAB) gene are responsible for a number of inherited human disorders, including cardiomyopathy, skeletal muscle myopathy, and cataracts. The cellular mechanisms of disease pathology for these disorders are not well understood. Among recent advances is that the disease state can be linked to a disturbance in the oxidation/reduction environment of the cell. In a mouse model, cardiomyopathy caused by the dominant CryAB(R120G) missense mutation was suppressed by mutation of the gene that encodes glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), one of the cell's primary sources of reducing equivalents in the form of NADPH. Here, we report the development of a Drosophila model for cellular dysfunction caused by this CryAB mutation. With this model, we confirmed the link between G6PD and mutant CryAB pathology by finding that reduction of G6PD expression suppressed the phenotype while overexpression enhanced it. Moreover, we find that expression of mutant CryAB in the Drosophila heart impaired cardiac function and increased heart tube dimensions, similar to the effects produced in mice and humans, and that reduction of G6PD ameliorated these effects. Finally, to determine whether CryAB pathology responds generally to NADPH levels we tested mutants or RNAi-mediated knockdowns of phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), and malic enzyme (MEN), the other major enzymatic sources of NADPH, and we found that all are capable of suppressing CryAB(R120G) pathology, confirming the link between NADP/H metabolism and CryAB.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Stress granules and P bodies are conserved cytoplasmic aggregates of nontranslating messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes (mRNPs) implicated in the regulation of mRNA translation and decay and are related to RNP granules in embryos, neurons, and pathological inclusions in some degenerative diseases. Using baker's yeast, 125 genes were identified in a genetic screen that affected the dynamics of P bodies and/or stress granules. Analyses of such mutants, including CDC48 alleles, provide evidence that stress granules can be targeted to the vacuole by autophagy, in a process termed granulophagy. Moreover, stress granule clearance in mammalian cells is reduced by inhibition of autophagy or by depletion or pathogenic mutations in valosin-containing protein (VCP), the human ortholog of CDC48. Because mutations in VCP predispose humans to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, inclusion body myopathy, and multisystem proteinopathy, this work suggests that autophagic clearance of stress granule related and pathogenic RNP granules that arise in degenerative diseases may be important in reducing their pathology.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report two sisters, aged 11 and 6years, with AGAT deficiency syndrome (OMIM 612718) which is the least common creatine deficiency syndrome. They were born full-term to consanguineous parents and had moderate developmental delay. Examination showed an important language delay, a progressive proximal muscular weakness in the lower limbs with Gowers sign and myopathic electromyography. Investigations revealed undetectable guanidinoacetate and low level of creatine in plasma and urine, characteristic findings of AGAT deficiency syndrome. Brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed a markedly reduced level of creatine. Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GATM) gene sequencing revealed a homozygous missense mutation in exon 4:c.608A>C, (p.Tyr203Ser). Thirteen months after beginning the treatment with oral creatine monohydrate 200mg/kg/day, then 400mg/kg/day, there was a dramatic improvement in muscle strength with Gowers sign disappearance in both patients, and a mild improvement in language and cognitive functions. AGAT deficiency syndrome should be considered in all patients with language retardation and cognitive impairment associated to a myopathy of unknown etiology such that early diagnosis must lead to creatine supplementation to cure the myopathy and improve language and cognitive function.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Amphiphysin 2, encoded by BIN1, is a key factor for membrane sensing and remodelling in different cell types. Homozygous BIN1 mutations in ubiquitously expressed exons are associated with autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy (CNM), a mildly progressive muscle disorder typically showing abnormal nuclear centralization on biopsies. In addition, misregulation of BIN1 splicing partially accounts for the muscle defects in myotonic dystrophy (DM). However, the muscle-specific function of amphiphysin 2 and its pathogenicity in both muscle disorders are not well understood. In this study we identified and characterized the first mutation affecting the splicing of the muscle-specific BIN1 exon 11 in a consanguineous family with rapidly progressive and ultimately fatal centronuclear myopathy. In parallel, we discovered a mutation in the same BIN1 exon 11 acceptor splice site as the genetic cause of the canine Inherited Myopathy of Great Danes (IMGD). Analysis of RNA from patient muscle demonstrated complete skipping of exon 11 and BIN1 constructs without exon 11 were unable to promote membrane tubulation in differentiated myotubes. Comparative immunofluorescence and ultrastructural analyses of patient and canine biopsies revealed common structural defects, emphasizing the importance of amphiphysin 2 in membrane remodelling and maintenance of the skeletal muscle triad. Our data demonstrate that the alteration of the muscle-specific function of amphiphysin 2 is a common pathomechanism for centronuclear myopathy, myotonic dystrophy, and IMGD. The IMGD dog is the first faithful model for human BIN1-related CNM and represents a mammalian model available for preclinical trials of potential therapies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathy (NEM) is a common congenital myopathy. At the very severe end of the NEM clinical spectrum are genetically unresolved cases of autosomal-recessive fetal akinesia sequence. We studied a multinational cohort of 143 severe-NEM-affected families lacking genetic diagnosis. We performed whole-exome sequencing of six families and targeted gene sequencing of additional families. We identified 19 mutations in KLHL40 (kelch-like family member 40) in 28 apparently unrelated NEM kindreds of various ethnicities. Accounting for up to 28% of the tested individuals in the Japanese cohort, KLHL40 mutations were found to be the most common cause of this severe form of NEM. Clinical features of affected individuals were severe and distinctive and included fetal akinesia or hypokinesia and contractures, fractures, respiratory failure, and swallowing difficulties at birth. Molecular modeling suggested that the missense substitutions would destabilize the protein. Protein studies showed that KLHL40 is a striated-muscle-specific protein that is absent in KLHL40-associated NEM skeletal muscle. In zebrafish, klhl40a and klhl40b expression is largely confined to the myotome and skeletal muscle, and knockdown of these isoforms results in disruption of muscle structure and loss of movement. We identified KLHL40 mutations as a frequent cause of severe autosomal-recessive NEM and showed that it plays a key role in muscle development and function. Screening of KLHL40 should be a priority in individuals who are affected by autosomal-recessive NEM and who present with prenatal symptoms and/or contractures and in all Japanese individuals with severe NEM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nebulin--a giant sarcomeric protein--plays a pivotal role in skeletal muscle contractility by specifying thin filament length and function. Although mutations in the gene encoding nebulin (NEB) are a frequent cause of nemaline myopathy, the most common non-dystrophic congenital myopathy, the mechanisms by which mutations in NEB cause muscle weakness remain largely unknown. To better understand these mechanisms, we have generated a mouse model in which Neb exon 55 is deleted (Neb(ΔExon55)) to replicate a founder mutation seen frequently in patients with nemaline myopathy with Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. Neb(ΔExon55) mice are born close to Mendelian ratios, but show growth retardation after birth. Electron microscopy studies show nemaline bodies--a hallmark feature of nemaline myopathy--in muscle fibres from Neb(ΔExon55) mice. Western blotting studies with nebulin-specific antibodies reveal reduced nebulin levels in muscle from Neb(ΔExon55) mice, and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy studies with tropomodulin antibodies and phalloidin reveal that thin filament length is significantly reduced. In line with reduced thin filament length, the maximal force generating capacity of permeabilized muscle fibres and single myofibrils is reduced in Neb(ΔExon55) mice with a more pronounced reduction at longer sarcomere lengths. Finally, in Neb(ΔExon55) mice the regulation of contraction is impaired, as evidenced by marked changes in crossbridge cycling kinetics and by a reduction of the calcium sensitivity of force generation. A novel drug that facilitates calcium binding to the thin filament significantly augmented the calcium sensitivity of submaximal force to levels that exceed those observed in untreated control muscle. In conclusion, we have characterized the first nebulin-based nemaline myopathy model, which recapitulates important features of the phenotype observed in patients harbouring this particular mutation, and which has severe muscle weakness caused by thin filament dysfunction.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Carriers of the rs4363657C and rs4149056C alleles in SLCO1B1 have increased myopathic complaints when taking simvastatin. Whether rosuvastatin has a similar effect is uncertain. This study assesses whether SLCO1B1 polymorphisms relate to clinical myalgia after rosuvastatin therapy. METHODS: In the JUPITER trial, participants without prior cardiovascular disease or diabetes who had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol &lt;130 mg/dL and C-reactive protein ≥2 mg/L were randomly allocated to rosuvastatin 20 mg or placebo and followed for the first cardiovascular disease events and adverse effects. We evaluated the effect of rs4363657 and rs4149056 in SLCO1B1, which encodes organic anion-transporting polypeptide OATP1B1, a regulator of hepatic statin uptake, on clinically reported myalgia. RESULTS: Among 4,404 participants allocated to rosuvastatin, clinical myalgia occurred with a rate of 4.1 events per 100 person-years as compared with 3.7 events per 100 person-years among 4,378 participants allocated to placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 1.13, 95% CI 0.98-1.30). Among those on rosuvastatin, there were no differences in the rate of myalgia among those with the rs4363657C (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.79-1.14 per allele) or the rs4149056C allele (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.79-1.15 per allele) compared with those without the C allele. Similar null data were observed when the myalgia definition was broadened to include muscle weakness, stiffness, or pain. None of the 3 participants on rosuvastatin or the 3 participants on placebo with frank myopathy had the minor allele at either polymorphism. CONCLUSION: There appears to be no increased risk of myalgia among users of rosuvastatin who carry the rs4363657C or the rs4149056C allele in SLCO1B1.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2) is a heterogeneous group of myopathies characterised by progressive muscle weakness involving proximal muscles of the shoulder and pelvic girdles including at least 17 different genetic entities. Additional loci have yet to be identified as there are families which are unlinked to any of the known loci. Here we have investigated a consanguineous family with LGMD2 with two affected individuals in order to identify the causative gene defect. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed genome wide homozygosity mapping and mapped the LGMD2 phenotype to chromosome 2q35-q36.3. DNA sequence analysis of the highly relevant candidate gene DES revealed a homozygous splice site mutation c.1289-2A>G in the two affected family members. Immunofluorescent staining and western blot analysis showed that the expression and the cytoskeletal network formation of mutant desmin were well preserved in skeletal muscle fibres. Unlike autosomal dominant desminopathies, ultrastructural alterations such as disruption of myofibrillar organisation, formation of myofibrillar degradation products and dislocation/aggregation of membranous organelles were not present. This novel splice site mutation results in addition of 16 amino acids within the tail domain of desmin, which has been suggested to interact with lamin B protein. We also detected a specific disruption of desmin-lamin B interaction in the skeletal muscle of the patient by confocal laser scanning microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that autosomal recessive mutations in DES cause LGMD2 phenotype without features of myofibrillar myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathy is the most common congenital myopathy and is caused by mutations in various genes such as ACTA1 (encoding skeletal α-actin). It is associated with limb and respiratory muscle weakness. Despite increasing clinical and scientific interest, the molecular and cellular events leading to such weakness remain unknown, which prevents the development of specific therapeutic interventions. To unravel the potential mechanisms involved, we dissected lower limb and diaphragm muscles from a knock-in mouse model of severe nemaline myopathy expressing the ACTA1 His40Tyr actin mutation found in human patients. We then studied a broad range of structural and functional characteristics assessing single-myofiber contraction, protein expression, and electron microscopy. One of the major findings in the diaphragm was the presence of numerous noncontractile areas (including disrupted sarcomeric structures and nemaline bodies). This greatly reduced the number of functional sarcomeres, decreased the force generation capacity at the muscle fiber level, and likely would contribute to respiratory weakness. In limb muscle, by contrast, there were fewer noncontractile areas and they did not seem to have a major role in the pathogenesis of weakness. These divergent muscle-specific results provide new important insights into the pathophysiology of severe nemaline myopathy and crucial information for future development of therapeutic strategies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The complex of Vacuolar Protein Sorting 34 and 15 (Vps34 and Vps15) has Class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and putative roles in nutrient sensing, mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR) activation by amino acids, cell growth, vesicular trafficking and autophagy. Contrary to expectations, here we show that Vps15-deficient mouse tissues are competent for LC3-positive autophagosome formation and maintain mTOR activation. However, an impaired lysosomal function in mutant cells is traced by accumulation of adaptor protein p62, LC3 and Lamp2 positive vesicles, which can be reverted to normal levels after ectopic overexpression of Vps15. Mice lacking Vps15 in skeletal muscles, develop a severe myopathy. Distinct from the autophagy deficient Atg7(-/-) mutants, pathognomonic morphological hallmarks of autophagic vacuolar myopathy (AVM) are observed in Vps15(-/-) mutants, including elevated creatine kinase plasma levels, accumulation of autophagosomes, glycogen and sarcolemmal features within the fibres. Importantly, Vps34/Vps15 overexpression in myoblasts of Danon AVM disease patients alleviates the glycogen accumulation. Thus, the activity of the Vps34/Vps15 complex is critical in disease conditions such as AVMs, and possibly a variety of other lysosomal storage diseases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Autophagy is a catabolic process that ensures homeostatic cell clearance and is deregulated in a growing number of myopathological conditions. Although FoxO3 was shown to promote the expression of autophagy-related genes in skeletal muscle, the mechanisms triggering autophagy are unclear. We show that TSC1-deficient mice (TSCmKO), characterized by sustained activation of mTORC1, develop a late-onset myopathy related to impaired autophagy. In young TSCmKO mice, constitutive and starvation-induced autophagy is blocked at the induction steps via mTORC1-mediated inhibition of Ulk1, despite FoxO3 activation. Rapamycin is sufficient to restore autophagy in TSCmKO mice and improves the muscle phenotype of old mutant mice. Inversely, abrogation of mTORC1 signaling by depletion of raptor induces autophagy regardless of FoxO inhibition. Thus, mTORC1 is the dominant regulator of autophagy induction in skeletal muscle and ensures a tight coordination of metabolic pathways. These findings may open interesting avenues for therapeutic strategies directed toward autophagy-related muscle diseases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To report a series of 11 patients on the severe end of the spectrum of ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) gene-related myopathy, in order to expand the clinical, histologic, and genetic heterogeneity associated with this group of patients. METHODS: Eleven patients evaluated in the neonatal period with severe neonatal-onset RYR1-associated myopathy confirmed by genetic testing were ascertained. Clinical features, molecular testing results, muscle imaging, and muscle histology are reviewed. RESULTS: Clinical features associated with the severe neonatal presentation of RYR1-associated myopathy included decreased fetal movement, hypotonia, poor feeding, respiratory involvement, arthrogryposis, and ophthalmoplegia in 3 patients, and femur fractures or hip dislocation at birth. Four patients had dominant RYR1 mutations, and 7 had recessive RYR1 mutations. One patient had a cleft palate, and another a congenital rigid spine phenotype-findings not previously described in the literature in patients with early-onset RYR1 mutations. Six patients who underwent muscle ultrasound showed relative sparing of the rectus femoris muscle. Histologically, all patients with dominant mutations had classic central cores on muscle biopsy. Patients with recessive mutations showed great histologic heterogeneity, including fibrosis, variation in fiber size, skewed fiber typing, very small fibers, and nuclear internalization with or without ill-defined cores. CONCLUSIONS: This series confirms and expands the clinical and histologic variability associated with severe congenital RYR1-associated myopathy. Both dominant and recessive mutations of the RYR1 gene can result in a severe neonatal-onset phenotype, but more clinical and histologic heterogeneity has been seen in those with recessive RYR1 gene mutations. Central cores are not obligatory histologic features in recessive RYR1 mutations. Sparing of the rectus femoris muscle on imaging should prompt evaluation for RYR1-associated myopathy in the appropriate clinical context.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The aim of this study was to investigate the function of the Hippo pathway member Yes-associated protein (Yap, gene name Yap1) in skeletal muscle fibres in vivo. Specifically we bred an inducible, skeletal muscle fibre-specific knock-in mouse model (MCK-tTA-hYAP1 S127A) to test whether the over expression of constitutively active Yap (hYAP1 S127A) is sufficient to drive muscle hypertrophy or stimulate changes in fibre type composition. Unexpectedly, after 5-7 weeks of constitutive hYAP1 S127A over expression, mice suddenly and rapidly lost 20-25% body weight and suffered from gait impairments and kyphosis. Skeletal muscles atrophied by 34-40% and the muscle fibre cross sectional area decreased by ≈40% when compared to control mice. Histological analysis revealed evidence of skeletal muscle degeneration and regeneration, necrotic fibres and a NADH-TR staining resembling centronuclear myopathy. In agreement with the histology, mRNA expression of markers of regenerative myogenesis (embryonic myosin heavy chain, Myf5, myogenin, Pax7) and muscle protein degradation (atrogin-1, MuRF1) were significantly elevated in muscles from transgenic mice versus control. No significant changes in fibre type composition were detected using ATPase staining. The phenotype was largely reversible, as a cessation of hYAP1 S127A expression rescued body and muscle weight, restored muscle morphology and prevented further pathological progression. To conclude, high Yap activity in muscle fibres does not induce fibre hypertrophy nor fibre type changes but instead results in a reversible atrophy and deterioration.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis of the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) has been facilitated by the use of immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blot analysis, and rapid genetic testing. METHODS: We identified 7 patients with LGMD2B or Miyoshi myopathy (MM) phenotypes and performed detailed history, physical examination, and mutation analyses of genomic DNA. RESULTS: Ten disease-causing variants of the dysferlin gene (DYSF) were detected, 4 of which were novel and predicted to be pathogenic (IVS33+9G>T, c.1343T>C, c.4747T>G, and c.5066dupC). Two of these mutations (c.1343T>C and IVS33+9G>T) were associated with a reduction in sarcolemmal dysferlin expression, despite increased total mRNA and protein in mixed muscle homogenates, due to a pathological retention of the mutated polypeptide in the cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: Considering that protein-based assays may yield false negative test results and that dysferlin aggregation may be present in other LGMDs, mutational screening is necessary for specific diagnosis in primary dysferlinopathy patients exhibiting this phenotype.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure (HMERF) was described in several North European families and recently linked to a titin gene (TTN) mutation. We independently studied HMERF-like diseases with the purpose to identify the cause, refine diagnostic criteria, and estimate the frequency of this disease among myopathy patients of various ethnic origins. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing analysis was carried out in a large U.S. family that included seven members suffering from skeletal muscle weakness and respiratory failure. Subsequent mutation screening was performed in further 45 unrelated probands with similar phenotypes. Studies included muscle strength evaluation, nerve conduction studies and concentric needle EMG, respiratory function test, cardiologic examination, and muscle biopsy. RESULTS: A novel TTN p.Gly30150Asp mutation was identified in the highly conserved A-band of titin that co-segregated with the disease in the U.S. family. Screening of 45 probands initially diagnosed as myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) but excluded based on molecular screening for the known MFM genes led to the identification of a previously reported TTN p.Cys30071Arg mutation in one patient. This same mutation was also identified in a patient with suspected HMERF. The p.Gly30150Asp and p.Cys30071Arg mutations are localized to a side chain of fibronectin type III element A150 of the 10th C-zone super-repeat of titin. CONCLUSIONS: Missense mutations in TTN are the cause of HMERF in families of diverse origins. A comparison of phenotypic features of HMERF caused by the three known TTN mutations in various populations allowed to emphasize distinct clinical/pathological features that can serve as the basis for diagnosis. The newly identified p.Gly30150Asp and the p.Cys30071Arg mutation are localized to a side chain of fibronectin type III element A150 of the 10th C-zone super-repeat of titin.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in VCP cause multisystem degeneration impacting the nervous system, muscle, and/or bone. Patients may present with ALS, Parkinsonism, frontotemporal dementia, myopathy, Paget's disease, or a combination of these. The disease mechanism is unknown. We developed a Drosophila model of VCP mutation-dependent degeneration. The phenotype is reminiscent of PINK1 and parkin mutants, including a pronounced mitochondrial defect. Indeed, VCP interacts genetically with the PINK1/parkin pathway in vivo. Paradoxically, VCP complements PINK1 deficiency but not parkin deficiency. The basis of this paradox is resolved by mechanistic studies in vitro showing that VCP recruitment to damaged mitochondria requires Parkin-mediated ubiquitination of mitochondrial targets. VCP recruitment coincides temporally with mitochondrial fission, and VCP is required for proteasome-dependent degradation of Mitofusins in vitro and in vivo. Further, VCP and its adaptor Npl4/Ufd1 are required for clearance of damaged mitochondria via the PINK1/Parkin pathway, and this is impaired by pathogenic mutations in VCP.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Mutations of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine-kinase (GNE)-gene are causally related to GNE myopathy. Yet, underlying pathomechanisms of muscle fibre damage have remained elusive. In sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM), the pro-inflammatory cell-stress mediators αB-crystallin and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are crucial markers of the disease pathology. METHODS: 10 muscle biopsies from GNE myopathy patients were analyzed for mRNA-expression of markers of cell-stress, inflammation and β-amyloid and compared to non-myopathic controls. Using double-labeling immunohistochemistry, serial sections of skeletal muscle biopsies were stained for amyloid precursor protein (APP), major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I, αB-crystallin, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), interleukin (IL)-1β, β-amyloid, iNOS, and phosphorylated neurofilament (P-neurofilament) as well as hematoxylin/eosin histochemistry. Corresponding areas of all biopsies with a total of 2,817 muscle fibres were quantitatively assessed for all markers. RESULTS: mRNA-expression of APP, NCAM, iNOS, TNF-α and TGF-β was higher in GNE myopathy compared to controls, yet this was not statistically significant. The mRNA-expression of APP and αB-crystallin significantly correlated with the expression of several pro-inflammatory and cell-stress-associated markers as NCAM, IL-1β, TGF-β, CCL-3, and CCL4. By immunohistochemistry, αB-crystallin and iNOS were co-upregulated and the number of fibres positive for αB-crystallin, NCAM, MHC-I and iNOS significantly correlated with each other. A large fraction of fibres positive for αB-crystallin were double positive for iNOS and vice-versa. Moreover, several fibres with structural abnormalities were positive for αB-crystallin and iNOS. Notably, particularly normal appearing fibres displayed an overexpression of these molecules. CONCLUSIONS: The cell-stress molecules αB-crystallin and iNOS are overexpressed in GNE myopathy muscle and may identify early disease mechanisms. The data help to better understand the pathology of GNE myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Two siblings from consanguineous parents died perinatally with a condition characterized by generalized hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency, arthrogryposis, microcephaly, congenital brain malformations and hyperglycinemia. Catalytic activities of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes I and II were deficient in skeletal muscle, a finding suggestive of an inborn error in mitochondrial biogenesis. Homozygosity mapping identified IBA57 located in the largest homozygous region on chromosome 1 as a culprit candidate gene. IBA57 is known to be involved in the biosynthesis of mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins. Sequence analysis of IBA57 revealed the homozygous mutation c.941A > C, p.Gln314Pro. Severely decreased amounts of IBA57 protein were observed in skeletal muscle and cultured skin fibroblasts from the affected subjects. HeLa cells depleted of IBA57 showed biochemical defects resembling the ones found in patient-derived cells, including a decrease in various mitochondrial [4Fe-4S] proteins and in proteins covalently linked to lipoic acid (LA), a cofactor produced by the [4Fe-4S] protein LA synthase. The defects could be complemented by wild-type IBA57 and partially by mutant IBA57. As a result of the mutation, IBA57 protein was excessively degraded, an effect ameliorated by protease inhibitors. Hence, we propose that the mutation leads to partial functional impairment of IBA57, yet the major pathogenic impact is due to its proteolytic degradation below physiologically critical levels. In conclusion, the ensuing lethal complex biochemical phenotype of a novel metabolic syndrome results from multiple Fe/S protein defects caused by a deficiency in the Fe/S cluster assembly protein IBA57.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The effect of the fast skeletal muscle troponin activator, CK-2066260, on calcium-induced force development was studied in skinned fast skeletal muscle fibers from wildtype (WT) and nebulin deficient (NEB KO) mice. Nebulin is a sarcomeric protein that when absent (NEB KO mouse) or present at low levels (nemaline myopathy (NM) patients with NEB mutations) causes muscle weakness. We studied the effect of fast skeletal troponin activation on WT muscle and tested whether it might be a therapeutic mechanism to increase muscle strength in nebulin deficient muscle. We measured tension-pCa relations with and without added CK-2066260. Maximal active tension in NEB KO tibialis cranialis fibers in the absence of CK-2066260 was ∼60% less than in WT fibers, consistent with earlier work. CK-2066260 shifted the tension-calcium relationship leftwards, with the largest relative increase (up to 8-fold) at low to intermediate calcium levels. This was a general effect that was present in both WT and NEB KO fiber bundles. At pCa levels above ∼6.0 (i.e., calcium concentrations &lt;1 µM), CK-2066260 increased tension of NEB KO fibers to beyond that of WT fibers. Crossbridge cycling kinetics were studied by measuring k(tr) (rate constant of force redevelopment following a rapid shortening/restretch). CK-2066260 greatly increased k(tr) at submaximal activation levels in both WT and NEB KO fiber bundles. We also studied the sarcomere length (SL) dependence of the CK-2066260 effect (SL 2.1 µm and 2.6 µm) and found that in the NEB KO fibers, CK-2066260 had a larger effect on calcium sensitivity at the long SL. We conclude that fast skeletal muscle troponin activation increases force at submaximal activation in both wildtype and NEB KO fiber bundles and, importantly, that this troponin activation is a potential therapeutic mechanism for increasing force in NM and other skeletal muscle diseases with loss of muscle strength.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Autoantibodies against melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5) have been described in several Asian dermatomyositis (DM) cohorts, often associated with amyopathic DM and rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD). A recent study of a DM cohort seen at a US dermatology clinic reports that MDA-5 autoantibodies are associated with a unique cutaneous phenotype. Given the widening spectrum of clinical findings, we evaluated the clinical features of anti-MDA-5-positive patients seen at a US myositis referral center. METHODS: One hundred sixty DM patients were screened for MDA-5 autoantibodies by immunoprecipitation and antibody titers were analyzed in longitudinal serum samples. Anti-MDA-5-positive patients were evaluated for the presence of additional myositis autoantibodies. Patient clinical characteristics were compared by retrospective chart review. RESULTS: MDA-5 was targeted in 11 (6.9%) of 160 patients with DM. Of these, 9 presented with a symmetric polyarthropathy, 6 demonstrated overt clinical myopathy, and 8 had ILD. Eight anti-MDA-5-positive patients exhibited the clinical attributes of the antisynthetase syndrome in the absence of Jo-1 or other antisynthetase autoantibodies. MDA-5 autoantibody titers did not correlate with clinical course. CONCLUSION: MDA-5 autoantibodies are found in DM patients presenting with a symmetric polyarthritis, clinically similar to rheumatoid arthritis. These patients often have features of the antisynthetase syndrome, but in the absence of antisynthetase autoantibodies. Most anti-MDA-5-positive patients had overt clinical myopathy and ILD. The latter, while occasionally severe, typically resolved with immunosuppressive therapy. In this cohort, the MDA-5 phenotype is frequently a clinical mimic of the antisynthetase syndrome and is not associated with rapidly progressive ILD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dynamin-2 (DNM2) is a large GTPase involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and related trafficking pathways. Mutations in human DNM2 cause two distinct neuromuscular disorders: centronuclear myopathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Zebrafish have been shown to be an excellent animal model for many neurologic disorders, and this system has the potential to inform our understanding of DNM2-related disease. Currently, little is known about the endogenous zebrafish orthologs to human DNM2. In this study, we characterize two zebrafish dynamin-2 genes, dnm2 and dnm2-like. Both orthologs are structurally similar to human DNM2 at the gene and protein levels. They are expressed throughout early development and in all adult tissues examined. Knockdown of dnm2 and dnm2-like gene products resulted in extensive morphological abnormalities during development, and expression of human DNM2 RNA rescued these phenotypes. Our findings suggest that dnm2 and dnm2-like are orthologs to human DNM2, and that they are required for normal zebrafish development.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Skeletal muscle complaints are a common consequence of cholesterol-lowering therapy. Transverse tubular (T-tubular) vacuolations occur in patients having statin-associated myopathy and, to a lesser extent, in statin-treated patients without myopathy. We have investigated quantitative changes in T-tubular morphology and looked for early indicators of T-tubular membrane repair in skeletal muscle biopsy samples from patients receiving cholesterol-lowering therapy who do not have myopathic side effects. Gene expression and protein levels of incipient membrane repair proteins were monitored in patients who tolerated statin treatment without myopathy and in statin-naive subjects. In addition, morphometry of the T-tubular system was performed. Only the gene expression for annexin A1 was up-regulated, whereas the expression of other repair genes remained unchanged. However, annexin A1 and dysferlin protein levels were significantly increased. In statin-treated patients, the volume fraction of the T-tubular system was significantly increased, but the volume fraction of the sarcoplasmic reticulum remained unchanged. A complex surface structure in combination with high mechanical loads makes skeletal muscle plasma membranes susceptible to injury. Ca(2+)-dependent membrane repair proteins such as dysferlin and annexin A1 are deployed at T-tubular sites. The up-regulation of annexin A1 gene expression and protein points to this protein as a biomarker for T-tubular repair.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The β-tropomyosin gene encodes a component of the sarcomeric thin filament. Rod-shaped dimers of tropomyosin regulate actin-myosin interactions and β-tropomyosin mutations have been associated with nemaline myopathy, cap myopathy, Escobar syndrome and distal arthrogryposis types 1A and 2B. In this study, we expand the allelic spectrum of β-tropomyosin-related myopathies through the identification of a novel β-tropomyosin mutation in two clinical contexts not previously associated with β-tropomyosin. The first clinical phenotype is core-rod myopathy, with a β-tropomyosin mutation uncovered by whole exome sequencing in a family with autosomal dominant distal myopathy and muscle biopsy features of both minicores and nemaline rods. The second phenotype, observed in four unrelated families, is autosomal dominant trismus-pseudocamptodactyly syndrome (distal arthrogryposis type 7; previously associated exclusively with myosin heavy chain 8 mutations). In all four families, the mutation identified was a novel 3-bp in-frame deletion (c.20_22del) that results in deletion of a conserved lysine at the seventh amino acid position (p.K7del). This is the first mutation identified in the extreme N-terminus of β-tropomyosin. To understand the potential pathogenic mechanism(s) underlying this mutation, we performed both computational analysis and in vivo modelling. Our theoretical model predicts that the mutation disrupts the N-terminus of the α-helices of dimeric β-tropomyosin, a change predicted to alter protein-protein binding between β-tropomyosin and other molecules and to disturb head-to-tail polymerization of β-tropomyosin dimers. To create an in vivo model, we expressed wild-type or p.K7del β-tropomyosin in the developing zebrafish. p.K7del β-tropomyosin fails to localize properly within the thin filament compartment and its expression alters sarcomere length, suggesting that the mutation interferes with head-to-tail β-tropomyosin polymerization and with overall sarcomeric structure. We describe a novel β-tropomyosin mutation, two clinical-histopathological phenotypes not previously associated with β-tropomyosin and pathogenic data from the first animal model of β-tropomyosin-related myopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded mitochondrial proteins can cause cardiomyopathy associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Hence, the cardiac phenotype of nuclear DNA mitochondrial mutations might be modulated by mtDNA variation. We studied a 13-generation Mennonite pedigree with autosomal recessive myopathy and cardiomyopathy due to an SLC25A4 frameshift null mutation (c.523delC, p.Q175RfsX38), which codes for the heart-muscle isoform of the adenine nucleotide translocator-1. Ten homozygous null (adenine nucleotide translocator-1(-/-)) patients monitored over a median of 6 years had a phenotype of progressive myocardial thickening, hyperalaninemia, lactic acidosis, exercise intolerance, and persistent adrenergic activation. Electrocardiography and echocardiography with velocity vector imaging revealed abnormal contractile mechanics, myocardial repolarization abnormalities, and impaired left ventricular relaxation. End-stage heart disease was characterized by massive, symmetric, concentric cardiac hypertrophy; widespread cardiomyocyte degeneration; overabundant and structurally abnormal mitochondria; extensive subendocardial interstitial fibrosis; and marked hypertrophy of arteriolar smooth muscle. Substantial variability in the progression and severity of heart disease segregated with maternal lineage, and sequencing of mtDNA from five maternal lineages revealed two major European haplogroups, U and H. Patients with the haplogroup U mtDNAs had more rapid and severe cardiomyopathy than those with haplogroup H.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: A study was undertaken to identify the molecular cause of Welander distal myopathy (WDM), a classic autosomal dominant distal myopathy. METHODS: The genetic linkage was confirmed and defined by microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism haplotyping. The whole linked genomic region was sequenced with targeted high-throughput and Sanger sequencing, and coding transcripts were sequenced on the cDNA level. WDM muscle biopsies were studied by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Splicing of TIA1 and its target genes in muscle and myoblast cultures was analyzed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Mutant TIA1 was characterized by cell biological studies on HeLa cells, including quantification of stress granules by high content analysis and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. RESULTS: The linked haplotype at 2p13 was narrowed down to &lt;806 kb. Sequencing by multiple methods revealed only 1 segregating coding mutation, c.1362 G>A (p.E384K) in the RNA-binding protein TIA1, a key component of stress granules. Immunofluorescence microscopy of WDM biopsies showed a focal increase of TIA1 in atrophic and vacuolated fibers. In HeLa cells, mutant TIA1 constructs caused a mild increase in stress granule abundance compared to wild type, and showed slower average fluorescence recovery in FRAP. INTERPRETATION: WDM is caused by mutated TIA1 through a dominant pathomechanism probably involving altered stress granule dynamics. Ann Neurol 2013.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) gene cause autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy and occur in around 50% of patients with centronuclear myopathy. We report clinical, morphological, muscle imaging and genetic data of 10 unrelated Italian patients with centronuclear myopathy related to DNM2 mutations. Our results confirm the clinical heterogeneity of this disease, underlining some peculiar clinical features, such as severe pulmonary impairment and jaw contracture that should be considered in the clinical follow-up of these patients. Muscle MRI showed a distinct pattern of involvement, with predominant involvement of soleus and tibialis anterior in the lower leg muscles, followed by hamstring muscles and adductor magnus at thigh level and gluteus maximus. The detection of three novel DNM2 mutations and the first case of somatic mosaicism further expand the genetic spectrum of the disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>DNAJB6, which encodes DnaJ homolog, subfamily B, member 6 (DNAJB6) was recently identified as a causative gene for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1D (LGMD1D). DNAJB6 is a member of heat shock protein 40 and contains a J domain, G/F domain and C-terminal domain. Only three different mutations have been identified in 11 families. In this study, we identified seven Japanese individuals from four unrelated families who carried a DNAJB6 mutation. We found a novel p.Phe96Ile substitution and a previously reported p.Phe96Leu change in the G/F domain of DNAJB6. All affected individuals showed slowly progressive muscle weakness, mainly in their legs, and their muscle pathology showed cytoplasmic inclusions and rimmed vacuoles. Our immunohistochemical analysis detected cytoplasmic accumulations associated with chaperone-assisted selective autophagy together with intranuclear accumulations of DNAJB6 and heat shock 22-kD protein 8 (HSPB8). This is the first report of Asian patients with LGMD1D. Our new findings may contribute to understanding the pathological mechanisms of this myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Manipulation of the mouse genome by site-specific mutagenesis has been extensively used to study gene function and model human disorders. Mouse models of myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a severe congenital muscular disorder due to loss-of-function mutations in the MTM1 gene, have been generated by homologous recombination and shown that myotubularin is essential for skeletal muscle. However, since the Mtm1 deletion occurred constitutively or shortly after birth in these mice, it is not known whether myotubularin is required during adulthood, an important issue in the context of not only muscle biology but also therapies. To delete the Mtm1 gene in adult muscle fibers, we constructed a recombinant adeno-associated vector (AAV) that expresses the Cre recombinase under the muscle-specific desmin promoter. We report that a single injection of this vector into muscles of 3-month-old Mtm1 conditional mice leads to a myotubular myopathy phenotype with myofiber atrophy, disorganization of organelle positioning, such as mitochondria and nuclei, T-tubule defects and severe muscle weakness. In addition, our results show that MTM1-related atrophy and dysfunction correlate with abnormalities in satellite cell number and markers of autophagy, protein synthesis and neuromuscular junction transmission. The expression level of atrogenes was also analyzed. Therefore, we provide a valuable tissue model that recapitulates the main features of the disease, and it is useful to study pathogenesis and evaluate therapeutic strategies. We establish the proof-of-concept that myotubularin is required for the proper function of skeletal muscle during adulthood, suggesting that therapies will be required for the entire life of XLMTM patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Centronuclear myopathies constitute a group of heterogeneous congenital myopathies characterized by the presence of abnormal, centrally located nuclei within muscle fibers. Centronuclear myopathies can be caused by mutations of several different genes, including DNM2, encoding dynamin 2 (DNM2) a large GTPase involved in membrane trafficking and endocytosis. We report a 52-year-old female with slowly progressive muscle weakness, and a family history of the disease. Clinical, morphological, biochemical and genetic analyses of the proband and her family members were performed, including analyses of the proband's muscle biopsy. A novel D614N mutation, located in the C-terminal region pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain of DNM2 was identified in the proband and four family members, who exhibited similar symptoms. The mutation was associated with profound changes in the localization of DNM2 in muscle fibers without significant changes in protein expression. Mutated DNM2 and proteins involved in the membrane trafficking or membrane compartments maintenance were dislocalized within the myofiber, and concentrated at centrally located nuclei. This novel causative mutation (D614N) within the DNM2 gene in a large Polish centronuclear myopathy family with a late age of overt clinical manifestation caused profound changes in DNM2 localization and impaired proper organization of myofibers, and skeletal muscle functioning.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A cardioskeletal myopathy with onset and death in infancy, morphological features of muscle type I hypotrophy with myofibrillar disorganization and dilated cardiomyopathy was previously reported in three Dutch families. Here we report the genetic cause of this disorder. Multipoint parametric linkage analysis of six Dutch patients identified a homozygous region of 2.1 Mb on chromosome 12, which was shared between all Dutch patients, with a log of odds score of 10.82. Sequence analysis of the entire linkage region resulted in the identification of a homozygous mutation in the last acceptor splice site of the myosin regulatory light chain 2 gene (MYL2) as the genetic cause. MYL2 encodes a myosin regulatory light chain (MLC-2V). The myosin regulatory light chains bind, together with the essential light chains, to the flexible neck region of the myosin heavy chain in the hexameric myosin complex and have a structural and regulatory role in muscle contraction. The MYL2 mutation results in use of a cryptic splice site upstream of the last exon causing a frameshift and replacement of the last 32 codons by 20 different codons. Whole exome sequencing of an Italian patient with similar clinical features showed compound heterozygosity for two other mutations affecting the same exon of MYL2, also resulting in mutant proteins with altered C-terminal tails. As a consequence of these mutations, the second EF-hand domain is disrupted. EF-hands, assumed to function as calcium sensors, can undergo a conformational change upon binding of calcium that is critical for interactions with downstream targets. Immunohistochemical staining of skeletal muscle tissue of the Dutch patients showed a diffuse and weak expression of the mutant protein without clear fibre specificity, while normal protein was absent. Heterozygous missense mutations in MYL2 are known to cause dominant hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; however, none of the parents showed signs of cardiomyopathy. In conclusion, the mutations in the last exon of MYL2 are responsible for a novel autosomal recessive lethal myosinopathy due to defects changing the C-terminal tail of the ventricular form of the myosin regulatory light chain. We propose 'light chain myopathy' as a name for this MYL2-associated myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Syndromes associated with multiple mtDNA deletions are due to different molecular defects that can result in a wide spectrum of predominantly adult-onset clinical presentations, ranging from progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) to multisystemic disorders of variable severity. The autosomal-dominant form of PEO is genetically heterogeneous. Recently, causative mutations have been reported in several nuclear genes that encode proteins of the mtDNA replisome machinery (POLG, POLG2, and C10orf2) or that are involved in pathways for the synthesis of deoxyribonuclotides (ANT1 and RRM2B). Despite these findings, putative mutations remain unknown in half of the subjects with PEO. We report the identification, by exome sequencing, of mutations in DNA2 in adult-onset individuals with a form of mitochondrial myopathy featuring instability of muscle mtDNA. DNA2 encodes a helicase/nuclease family member that is most likely involved in mtDNA replication, as well as in the long-patch base-excision repair (LP-BER) pathway. In vitro biochemical analysis of purified mutant proteins revealed a severe impairment of nuclease, helicase, and ATPase activities. These results implicate human DNA2 and the LP-BER pathway in the pathogenesis of adult-onset disorders of mtDNA maintenance.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Methylation is a post-translational modification that can affect numerous features of proteins, notably cellular localization, turnover, activity, and molecular interactions. Recent genome-wide analyses have considerably extended the list of human genes encoding putative methyltransferases. Studies on protein methyltransferases have revealed that the regulatory function of methylation is not limited to epigenetics, with many non-histone substrates now being discovered. We present here our findings on a novel family of distantly related putative methyltransferases. Affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry shows a marked preference for these proteins to associate with various chaperones. Based on the spectral data, we were able to identify methylation sites in substrates, notably trimethylation of K135 of KIN/Kin17, K561 of HSPA8/Hsc70 as well as corresponding lysine residues in other Hsp70 isoforms, and K315 of VCP/p97. All modification sites were subsequently confirmed in vitro. In the case of VCP, methylation by METTL21D was stimulated by the addition of the UBX cofactor ASPSCR1, which we show directly interacts with the methyltransferase. This stimulatory effect was lost when we used VCP mutants (R155H, R159G, and R191Q) known to cause Inclusion Body Myopathy with Paget's disease of bone and Fronto-temporal Dementia (IBMPFD) and/or familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Lysine 315 falls in proximity to the Walker B motif of VCP's first ATPase/D1 domain. Our results indicate that methylation of this site negatively impacts its ATPase activity. Overall, this report uncovers a new role for protein methylation as a regulatory pathway for molecular chaperones and defines a novel regulatory mechanism for the chaperone VCP, whose deregulation is causative of degenerative neuromuscular diseases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Welander distal myopathy (WDM) is an adult onset autosomal dominant disorder characterized by distal limb weakness, which progresses slowly from the fifth decade. All WDM patients are of Swedish or Finnish descent and share a rare chromosome 2p13 haplotype. We restricted the WDM-associated haplotype followed by whole exome sequencing. Within the conserved haplotype, we identified a single heterozygous mutation c.1150G>A (p.E384K) in T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA1) in all WDM patients investigated (n = 43). The TIA1 protein regulates splicing, and translation through direct interaction with mRNA and the p.E384K mutation is located in the C-terminal Q-rich domain that interacts with the U1-C splicing factor. TIA1 has been shown to prevent skipping of SMN2 exon 7, and we show that WDM patients have increased levels of spliced SMN2 in skeletal muscle cells when compared with controls. Immunostaining of WDM muscle biopsies showed accumulation of TIA1 and stress granulae proteins adjacent to intracellular inclusions, a typical finding in WDM. The combined findings strongly suggest that the TIA1 mutation causes perturbed RNA splicing and cellular stress resulting in WDM. The selection against the mutation is likely to be negligible and the age of the TIA1 founder mutation was calculated to approximately 1,050 years, which coincides with the epoch of early seafaring across the Baltic Sea.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myosinopathies have emerged as a new group of diseases and are caused by mutations in genes encoding myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms. One major hallmark of these diseases is skeletal muscle weakness or paralysis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we have undertaken a detailed functional study of muscle fibers from Myh4(arl) mice, which carry a mutation that provokes an L342Q change within the catalytic domain of the type IIb skeletal muscle myosin protein MYH4. Because homozygous animals develop rapid muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis, they must be killed by postnatal day 13, so all experiments were performed using skeletal muscles from adult heterozygous animals (Myh4(arl)/+). Myh4(arl)/+ mice contain MYH4(L342Q) expressed at 7% of the levels of the wild-type (WT) protein, and are overtly and histologically normal. However, mechanical and X-ray diffraction pattern analyses of single membrane-permeabilized fibers revealed, upon maximal Ca(2+) activation, higher stiffness as well as altered meridional and equatorial reflections in Myh4(arl)/+ mice when compared with age-matched WT animals. Under rigor conditions, by contrast, no difference was observed between Myh4(arl)/+ and WT mice. Altogether, these findings prove that, in adult MYH4(L342Q) heterozygous mice, the transition from weak to strong myosin cross-bridge binding is facilitated, increasing the number of strongly attached myosin heads, thus enhancing force production. These changes are predictably exacerbated in the type IIb fibers of homozygous mice, in which the embryonic myosin isoform is fully replaced by MYH4(L342Q), leading to a hypercontraction, muscle-structure disruption and lower-limb paralysis. Overall, these findings provide important insights into the molecular pathogenesis of skeletal myosinopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>p97/VCP is a hexameric AAA type ATPase that functions in a variety of cellular processes such as endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD), organelle biogenesis, autophagy and cell-cycle regulation. Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is an autosomal dominant disorder which has been attributed to mutations in p97/VCP. Several missense mutations affecting twelve different amino acids have been identified in IBMPFD patients and some of them were suggested to be involved in the observed pathology. Here, we analyzed the effect of all twelve p97/VCP variants on ERAD substrates and their cofactor binding abilities. While all mutants cause ERAD substrate accumulation, P137L mutant p97/VCP differs from other IBMPFD mutants by having a unique solubility profile and subcellular localization. Intriguingly, although almost all mutants exhibit enhanced p47 and Ufd1-Npl4 binding, the P137L mutation completely abolishes p97/VCP interactions with Ufd1, Npl4 and p47, while retaining its gp78 binding. While recombinant R155C mutant protein consistently interacts with both Ufd1 and VIM of gp78, P137L mutant protein lost binding ability to Ufd1 but not to VIM in vitro. The differential impairments in p97/VCP interactions with its functional partners and function should help our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of IBMPFD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Tubular aggregates are regular arrays of membrane tubules accumulating in muscle with age. They are found as secondary features in several muscle disorders, including alcohol- and drug-induced myopathies, exercise-induced cramps, and inherited myasthenia, but also exist as a pure genetic form characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness. We identified dominant STIM1 mutations as a genetic cause of tubular-aggregate myopathy (TAM). Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is the main Ca(2+) sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum, and all mutations were found in the highly conserved intraluminal Ca(2+)-binding EF hands. Ca(2+) stores are refilled through a process called store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE). Upon Ca(2+)-store depletion, wild-type STIM1 oligomerizes and thereby triggers extracellular Ca(2+) entry. In contrast, the missense mutations found in our four TAM-affected families induced constitutive STIM1 clustering, indicating that Ca(2+) sensing was impaired. By monitoring the calcium response of TAM myoblasts to SOCE, we found a significantly higher basal Ca(2+) level in TAM cells and a dysregulation of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. Because recessive STIM1 loss-of-function mutations were associated with immunodeficiency, we conclude that the tissue-specific impact of STIM1 loss or constitutive activation is different and that a tight regulation of STIM1-dependent SOCE is fundamental for normal skeletal-muscle structure and function.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the human SEPN1 gene, encoding selenoprotein N (SepN), cause SEPN1-related myopathy (SEPN1-RM) characterized by muscle weakness, spinal rigidity, and respiratory insufficiency. As with other members of the selenoprotein family, selenoprotein N incorporates selenium in the form of selenocysteine (Sec). Most selenoproteins that have been functionally characterized are involved in oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions, with the Sec residue located at their catalytic site. To model SEPN1-RM, we generated a Sepn1-knockout (Sepn1(-/-)) mouse line. Homozygous Sepn1(-/-) mice are fertile, and their weight and lifespan are comparable to wild-type (WT) animals. Under baseline conditions, the muscle histology of Sepn1(-/-) mice remains normal, but subtle core lesions could be detected in skeletal muscle after inducing oxidative stress. Ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium release channels showed lower sensitivity to caffeine in SepN deficient myofibers, suggesting a possible role of SepN in RyR regulation. SepN deficiency also leads to abnormal lung development characterized by enlarged alveoli, which is associated with decreased tissue elastance and increased quasi-static compliance of Sepn1(-/-) lungs. This finding raises the possibility that the respiratory syndrome observed in patients with SEPN1 mutations may have a primary pulmonary component in addition to the weakness of respiratory muscles.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To investigate B cell survival cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) levels as biomarkers of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM). METHODS: We measured and compared mRNA levels of B cell survival cytokines by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in 98 patients with IIM, 38 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and 21 healthy controls. The cytokines were B cell-activating factor belonging to the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF); ΔBAFF; and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL); and their receptors BAFF-R, transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor, and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA). We also identified autoantibodies, including anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-SSA/Ro, anti-SSB/La, anti-topoisomerase 1, anti-hystidyl-tRNA synthetase, anti-ribosomal P, and anti-chromatin. Clinical disease activity was assessed by the International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies core set tool. We examined correlation of mRNA with disease activity, medication use, and autoantibodies. RESULTS: We found a positive correlation of BAFF and ΔBAFF expression with 3 disease activity measures, with ΔBAFF having a stronger correlation. Similarly, anti-SSA/Ro-52 and/or anti-SSA/Ro-60 had a strong positive correlation with mRNA levels of BAFF and ΔBAFF, and with relative ratios of BAFF/APRIL and BCMA/BAFF-R. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the potential importance of BAFF, ΔBAFF, and BAFF-R in the pathogenesis of IIM, and suggest an important role in the assessment of disease activity.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked Myopathy with Excessive Autophagy (XMEA) is a childhood onset disease characterized by progressive vacuolation and atrophy of skeletal muscle. We show that XMEA is caused by hypomorphic alleles of the VMA21 gene, that VMA21 is the diverged human ortholog of the yeast Vma21p protein, and that like Vma21p, VMA21 is an essential assembly chaperone of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), the principal mammalian proton pump complex. Decreased VMA21 raises lysosomal pH which reduces lysosomal degradative ability and blocks autophagy. This reduces cellular free amino acids which leads to downregulation of the mTORC1 pathway, and consequent increased macroautophagy resulting in proliferation of large and ineffective autolysosomes that engulf sections of cytoplasm, merge, and vacuolate the cell. Our results uncover a novel mechanism of disease, namely macroautophagic overcompensation leading to cell vacuolation and tissue atrophy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>No effective treatment exists for patients with X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a fatal congenital muscle disease caused by deficiency of the lipid phosphatase, myotubularin. The Mtm1δ4 and Mtm1 p.R69C mice model severely and moderately symptomatic XLMTM, respectively, due to differences in the degree of myotubularin deficiency. Contractile function of intact extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles from Mtm1δ4 mice, which produce no myotubularin, is markedly impaired. Contractile forces generated by chemically skinned single fiber preparations from Mtm1δ4 muscle were largely preserved, indicating that weakness was largely due to impaired excitation contraction coupling. Mtm1 p.R69C mice, which produce small amounts of myotubularin, showed impaired contractile function only in EDL muscles. Short-term replacement of myotubularin with a prototypical targeted protein replacement agent (3E10Fv-MTM1) in Mtm1δ4 mice improved contractile function and muscle pathology. These promising findings suggest that even low levels of myotubularin protein replacement can improve the muscle weakness and reverse the pathology that characterizes XLMTM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) is a childhood motoneuron disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding for IGHMBP2, an ATPase/Helicase. Paralysis of the diaphragm is an early and prominent clinical sign resulting both from denervation and myopathy. In skeletal muscles, muscle atrophy mainly results from loss of motoneuron cell bodies and axonal degeneration. Although it is well known that loss of motoneurons at the lumbar spinal cord is an early event in the pathogenesis of the disease, it is not clear whether the corresponding proximal axons and NMJs are also early affected. In order to address this question, we have investigated the time course of the disease progression at the level of the motoneuron cell body, proximal axon (ventral root), distal axon (sciatic nerve), NMJ, and muscle fiber in Nmd(2J) mice, a mouse model for SMARD1. Our results show an early and apparently parallel loss of motoneurons, proximal axons, and NMJs. In affected muscles, however, denervated fibers coexist with NMJs with normal morphology and unaltered neurotransmission. Furthermore, unaffected axons are able to sprout and reinnervate muscle fibers, suggesting selective vulnerability of neurons to Ighmbp2 deficiency. The preservation of the NMJ morphology and neurotransmission in the Nmd(2J) mouse until motor axon loss takes place, differs from that observed in SMA mouse models in which NMJ impairment is an early and more general phenomenon in affected muscles.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Over 190 mutations in the human skeletal muscle α-actin gene, ACTA1 cause congenital actin myopathies. We transgenically expressed six different mutant actins, G15R, I136M, D154N, V163L, V163M and D292V in Drosophila indirect flight muscles and investigated their effects in flies that express one wild type and one mutant actin copy. All the flies were flightless, and the IFMs showed incomplete Z-discs, disorganised actin filaments and 'zebra bodies'. No differences in levels of sarcomeric protein expression were observed, but tropomodulin staining was somewhat disrupted in D164N, V163L, G15R and V163M heterozygotes. A single copy of D292V mutant actin rescued the hypercontractile phenotypes caused by TnI and TnT mutants, suggesting that the D292V mutation interferes with thin filament regulation. Our results show that expression of actin mutations homologous to those in humans in the indirect flight muscles of Drosophila disrupt sarcomere organisation, with somewhat similar phenotypes to those observed in humans. Using Drosophila to study actin mutations may help aid our understanding of congential myopathies caused by actin mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Autophagy is dysfunctional in many degenerative diseases including myopathies. Mutations in valosin-containing protein (VCP) cause inclusion body myopathy (IBM) associated with Paget's disease of the bone, fronto-temporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (IBMPFD/ALS). VCP is necessary for protein degradation via the proteasome and lysosome. IBMPFD/ALS mutations in VCP disrupt autophagosome and endosome maturation resulting in vacuolation, weakness and muscle atrophy. To understand the regulation of autophagy in VCP-IBM muscle, we examined the AKT/FOXO3 and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. Basal Akt and FOXO3 phosphorylation was normal. In contrast, the phosphorylation of mTOR targets was decreased. Consistent with this, global protein translation was diminished and autophagosome biogenesis was increased in VCP-IBM muscle. Further mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin hastened weakness, atrophy and vacuolation in VCP-IBM mice. This was accompanied by the accumulation of autophagic substrates such as p62, LC3II and ubiquitinated proteins. The decrease in mTOR signaling was partially rescued by insulin and to a lesser extent by amino acid (AA) stimulation in VCP-IBM muscle. Cells expressing catalytically inactive VCP or treated with a VCP inhibitor also failed to activate mTOR upon nutrient stimulation. Expression of a constitutively active Rheb enhanced mTOR activity and increased the fiber size in VCP-IBM mouse skeletal muscle. These studies suggest that VCP mutations may disrupt mTOR signaling and contribute to IBMPFD/ALS disease pathogenesis. Treatment of some autophagic disorders with mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin may worsen disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: Dysferlin encoded by DYSF deficiency leads to two main phenotypes, limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2B and Miyoshi myopathy. To reveal in detail the mutational and clinical features of LGMD2B in Japan, we observed 40 Japanese patients in 36 families with LGMD2B in whom dysferlin mutations were confirmed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Three mutations (c.1566C>G, c.2997G>T and c.4497delT) were relatively more prevalent. The c.2997G>T mutation was associated with late onset, proximal dominant forms of dysferlinopathy, a high probability that muscle weakness started in an upper limb and lower serum creatine kinase (CK) levels. The clinical features of LGMD2B are as follows: (1) onset in the late teens or early adulthood, except patients homozygous for the c.2997G>T mutation; (2) lower limb weakness at onset; (3) distal change of lower limbs on muscle CT at an early stage; (4) impairment of lumbar erector spinal muscles on muscle CT at an early stage; (5) predominant involvement of proximal upper limbs; (6) preservation of function of the hands at late stage; (7) preservation of strength in neck muscles at late stage; (8) lack of facial weakness or dysphagia; (9) avoidance of scoliosis; (10) hyper-Ckaemia; (11) preservation of cardiac function; and (12) a tendency for respiratory function to decline with disease duration. It is important that the late onset phenotype is found with prevalent mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>RATIONALE: Critical illness myopathy (CIM) has no known cause and no treatment. Immobilization and impaired glucose metabolism are implicated. OBJECTIVES: We assessed signal transduction in skeletal muscle of patients at risk for CIM. We also investigated the effects of evoked muscle contraction. METHODS: In a prospective observational and interventional pilot study, we screened 874 mechanically ventilated patients with a sepsis-related organ-failure assessment score greater than or equal to 8 for 3 consecutive days in the first 5 days of intensive care unit stay. Thirty patients at risk for CIM underwent euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, muscle microdialysis studies, and muscle biopsies. Control subjects were healthy. In five additional patients at risk for CIM, we performed corresponding analyses after 12-day, daily, unilateral electrical muscle stimulation with the contralateral leg as control. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We performed successive muscle biopsies and assessed systemic insulin sensitivity and signal transduction pathways of glucose utilization at the mRNA and protein level and glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) localization in skeletal muscle tissue. Skeletal muscle GLUT4 was trapped at perinuclear spaces, most pronounced in patients with CIM, but resided at the sarcolemma in control subjects. Glucose metabolism was not stimulated during euglycemic-hyperinsulinergic clamp. Insulin signal transduction was competent up to p-Akt activation; however, p-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) was not detectable in CIM muscle. Electrical muscle stimulation increased p-AMPK, repositioned GLUT4, locally improved glucose metabolism, and prevented type-2 fiber atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient GLUT4 translocation results in decreased glucose supply in patients with CIM. Failed AMPK activation is involved. Evoked muscle contraction may prevent muscle-specific AMPK failure, restore GLUT4 disposition, and diminish protein breakdown.

<rdfs:comment>GNE myopathy is a recessive adult onset, slowly progressive distal and proximal myopathy, caused by mutations in the GNE gene. The most frequent mutation in GNE myopathy patients is the Middle Eastern founder mutation M712T. We have generated Gne (M712T/M712T) knockin mice. A high mortality rate in the first generation due to renal failure was recorded (as previously described). However, the following Gne (M712T/M712T) offspring generations could be classified into 3 phenotypic categories: severe, mild and without apparent phenotype. By further crossing between mice with no apparent phenotype, we were able to establish a colony of Gne (M712T/M712T) knockin mice with a high- and long-term survival rate, lacking any renal phenotype. These mice did not present any muscle phenotype (clinical or pathological) for up to 18 months. No correlation was found between the expression of any of the two mRNA Gne isoforms in muscle and the mouse genotype or phenotype. However, the expression of isoform 2 mRNA was significantly higher in the kidney of Gne (M712T/M712T) kidney affected mice compared with control. In contrast, the expression of UPR markers Bip, Chop and of the spliced form of XBP1, was upregulated in muscle of Gne (M712T/M712T) mice compared with controls, but was unchanged in the affected kidney. Thus, Gne defects can affect both muscle and kidney in mouse, but probably through different mechanisms.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myofibrillar myopathy caused by FLNC/filamin C mutations is characterized by disintegration of myofibrils and a massive formation of protein aggregates within skeletal muscle fibers. We performed immunofluorescence studies in skeletal muscle sections from filaminopathy patients to detect disturbances of protein quality control mechanisms. Our analyses revealed altered expression of chaperone proteins and components of proteasomal and autophagic degradation pathways in abnormal muscle fibers that harbor protein deposits but not in neighboring muscle fibers without pathological protein aggregation. These findings suggest a dysfunction of protein stabilizing and degrading mechanisms that leads to a pathological accumulation of protein aggregates in abnormal fibers. Accordingly, a pharmacological modulation of chaperone activity may be a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent protein aggregation and to reduce disease progression. Newly established filaminopathy cell culture models provide a suitable basis for testing such pharmacological approaches.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Recently, COL4A1 mutations have been reported in porencephaly and other cerebral vascular diseases, often associated with ocular, renal, and muscular features. In this study, we aimed to clarify the phenotypic spectrum and incidence of COL4A1 mutations. METHODS: We screened for COL4A1 mutations in 61 patients with porencephaly and 10 patients with schizencephaly, which may be similarly caused by disturbed vascular supply leading to cerebral degeneration, but can be distinguished depending on time of insult. RESULTS: COL4A1 mutations were identified in 15 patients (21%, 10 mutations in porencephaly and 5 mutations in schizencephaly), who showed a variety of associated findings, including intracranial calcification, focal cortical dysplasia, pontocerebellar atrophy, ocular abnormalities, myopathy, elevated serum creatine kinase levels, and hemolytic anemia. Mutations include 10 missense, a nonsense, a frameshift, and 3 splice site mutations. Five mutations were confirmed as de novo events. One mutation was cosegregated with familial porencephaly, and 2 mutations were inherited from asymptomatic parents. Aberrant splicing was demonstrated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses in 2 patients with splice site mutations. INTERPRETATION: Our study first confirmed that COL4A1 mutations are associated with schizencephaly and hemolytic anemia. Based on the finding that COL4A1 mutations were frequent in patients with porencephaly and schizencephaly, genetic testing for COL4A1 should be considered for children with these conditions.</rdfs:comment>

To better understand the cellular events related to protein aggregation and cell death, we transfected cataract and cardio-myopathy causing mutants, R11H, P20S, R56W, D109H, R120G, D140N, G154S, R157H and A171T in HeLa cells and assessed protein aggregation and apoptosis by laser scanning confocal microspy (LSCM) and flow cytometry. Cells individually transfected with the mutants, D109H, R120G, D140N and R157H significantly showed more aggregates. Cells overexpressed with HspB1 (Hsp27) significantly sequestered aggregates in all mutants and suppressed apoptosis in mutants, P20S, D109H and A171T. Significant increases of apoptotic cells as stained with Annexin V were observed in mutants, D109H and A171T transfected cells. Cells positive for active caspase-3 was increased in the mutant, D109H. Thus the previously recognized anti-apoptotic functions of αB-crystallin were compromised in these mutants.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) is a familial skeletal muscle disorder that presents with recurrent episodes of severe weakness lasting hours to days associated with reduced serum potassium (K+). HypoPP is genetically heterogeneous, with missense mutations of a calcium channel (Ca(V)1.1) or a sodium channel (Na(V)1.4) accounting for 60% and 20% of cases, respectively. The mechanistic link between Ca(V)1.1 mutations and the ictal loss of muscle excitability during an attack of weakness in HypoPP is unknown. To address this question, we developed a mouse model for HypoPP with a targeted Ca(V)1.1 R528H mutation. The Ca(V)1.1 R528H mice had a HypoPP phenotype for which low K+ challenge produced a paradoxical depolarization of the resting potential, loss of muscle excitability, and weakness. A vacuolar myopathy with dilated transverse tubules and disruption of the triad junctions impaired Ca2+ release and likely contributed to the mild permanent weakness. Fibers from the Ca(V)1.1 R528H mouse had a small anomalous inward current at the resting potential, similar to our observations in the Na(V)1.4 R669H HypoPP mouse model. This "gating pore current" may be a common mechanism for paradoxical depolarization and susceptibility to HypoPP arising from missense mutations in the S4 voltage sensor of either calcium or sodium channels.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>INTRODUCTION: Reducing body myopathy is a rare X-linked myopathy. It is characterized by intracytoplasmic inclusions that stain with menadione-nitroblue tetrazolium. It is caused by mutations in the FHL1 gene, which encodes the four-and-a-half LIM domain 1 protein (FHL1). METHODS: We performed a clinical, muscle MRI, and histopathological characterization and immunoblot and genetic analysis of the FHL1 protein in a family with 4 individuals affected by reducing body myopathy. RESULTS: We identified a novel missense mutation in FHL1 (c.449G>C; p.C150S). The patients presented with asymmetric proximal weakness and scoliosis. Both of the boys had a more severe course with earlier onset, contractures, and death due to heart failure at 14 and 18 years of age, respectively. MRI revealed fatty infiltration of posteromedial thigh and paraspinal muscles. Histopathological findings showed FHL1-immunoreactive inclusions. Immunoblot analysis revealed a 50% reduction of FHL1 protein. CONCLUSION: In this study we highlighted diagnostic clues in this myopathy and compared our data with the literature.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We explored the potential of mutant allele-specific gene silencing (ASGS) in providing therapeutic benefit in two established mouse models of the autosomal dominantly-inherited muscle disorders, Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) and Central Core Disease (CCD). Candidate ASGS siRNAs were designed and validated for efficacy and specificity on ryanodine receptor (RyR1) cDNA mini-constructs expressed in HEK293 cells using RT-PCR- and confocal microscopy-based assays. In vivo delivery of the most efficacious identified siRNAs into flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscles was achieved by injection/electroporation of footpads of 4-6 month old heterozygous Ryr1(Y524S/+) (YS/+) and Ryr1(I4895T/+) (IT/+) knock-in mice, established mouse models of MH with cores and CCD, respectively. Treatment of IT/+ mice resulted in a modest rescue of deficits in the maximum rate (∼38% rescue) and magnitude (∼78%) of ligand-induced Ca(2+) release that occurred in the absence of a change in the magnitude of electrically-evoked Ca(2+) release. Compared to the difference between the caffeine sensitivity of Ca(2+) release in FDB fibers from YS/+ and WT mice treated with SCR siRNA (EC(50): 1.1 mM versus 4.4 mM, respectively), caffeine sensitivity was normalized in FDB fibers from YS/+ mice following 2 (EC(50): 2.8 mM) and 4 week (EC(50): 6.6 mM) treatment with YS allele-specific siRNA. Moreover, the temperature-dependent increase in resting Ca(2+) observed in FDB fibers from YS/+ mice was normalized to WT levels after 2 weeks of treatment with YS allele-specific siRNA. As determined by quantitative real time PCR, the degree of functional rescue in YS/+ and IT/+ mice correlated well with the relative increase in fractional WT allele expression.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To identify the genetic variant that causes autosomal dominantly inherited motor neuron disease in a 4-generation Israeli-Arab family using genetic linkage and whole exome sequencing. METHODS: Genetic linkage analysis was performed in this family using Illumina single nucleotide polymorphism chips. Whole exome sequencing was then undertaken on DNA samples from 2 affected family members using an Illumina 2000 HiSeq platform in pursuit of potentially pathogenic genetic variants that comigrate with the disease in this pedigree. Variants meeting these criteria were then screened in all affected individuals. RESULTS: A novel mutation (p.R191G) in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene was identified in the index family. Direct sequencing of the VCP gene in a panel of DNA from 274 unrelated individuals with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) revealed 5 additional mutations. Among them, 2 were previously identified in pedigrees with a constellation of inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) and in FALS, and 2 other mutations (p.R159C and p.R155C) in IBMPFD alone. We did not detect VCP gene mutations in DNA from 178 cases of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: We report a novel VCP mutation identified in an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis family (p.R191G) with atypical clinical features. In our experience, VCP mutations arise in approximately 1.5% of FALS cases. Our study supports the view that motor neuron disease is part of the clinical spectrum of VCP-associated disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>There has been considerable progress during the past 24 years in the molecular genetics of mitochondrial DNA and related nuclear DNA mutations, and more than 100 nerve biopsies from hereditary neuropathies related to mitochondrial cytopathy have been accurately examined. Neuropathies were first reported in diseases related to point mutations of mitochondrial DNA, but they proved to be a prominent feature of the phenotype in mitochondrial disorders caused by defects in nuclear DNA, particularly in 3 genes: polymerase gamma 1 (POLG1), mitofusin 2 (MFN2), and ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1). Most patients have sensory-motor neuropathy, sometimes associated with ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, seizures, parkinsonism, myopathy, or visceral disorders. Some cases are caused by consanguinity, but most are sporadic with various phenotypes mimicking a wide range of other etiologies. Histochemistry on muscle biopsy, as well as identification of crystalloid inclusions at electron microscopy, may provide a diagnostic clue to mitochondriopathy, but nerve biopsy is often less informative. Nevertheless, enlarged mitochondria containing distorted or amputated cristae are highly suggestive, particularly when located in the Schwann cell cytoplasm. Also noticeable are clusters of regenerating myelinated fibers surrounded by concentric Schwann cell processes, and such onion bulb-like formations are frequently observed in neuropathies caused by GDAP1 mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia is a rare but highly penetrant autosomal dominant progressive disorder linked to mutations in valosin containing protein (VCP). Here, we characterize a novel mutation in the linker 1 domain of VCP leading to inclusion body myopathy and/or frontotemporal dementia in 3 generations of a Swiss family. A detailed history of several years of clinical follow-up and electrophysiological, radiological and pathological findings are presented. Five out of 6 individuals suffered from progressive myopathy and 2 out of 6 from frontotemporal dementia, respectively. A radiologically suspected Paget's disease of the bone could not been confirmed at autopsy. This case study illustrates that only a subset of individuals shows the full triad of the disease complex and that clinicopathological findings are - when interpreted apart from familial history - hard to distinguish from sporadic inclusion body myositis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In 1977 Wijngaarden et al. reported a Dutch family with a congenital myopathy characterized by external ophthalmoplegia and a remarkable histological feature, focal loss of cross-striations. A small number of other families with similar clinical and pathological features led to the consideration of this congenital myopathy as a distinct entity. Here we present more than 30years of follow-up from the Dutch family and report recently identified compound heterozygous mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene, c.10627-2A>G and p.Arg3539His (c.10616G>A). Focal loss of cross-striations on muscle biopsy is another histopathological feature that should raise the possibility of RYR1 involvement.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>GNE myopathy, previously termed hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM), is an adult-onset neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness. The disorder results from biallelic mutations in GNE, encoding UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase, the key enzyme of sialic acid synthesis. GNE myopathy, associated with impaired glycan sialylation, has no approved therapy. Here we test potential sialylation-increasing monosaccharides for their effectiveness in prophylaxis (at the embryonic and neonatal stages) and therapy (after the onset of symptoms) by evaluating renal and muscle hyposialylation in a knock-in mouse model (Gne p.M712T) of GNE myopathy. We demonstrate that oral mannosamine (ManN), but not sialic acid (Neu5Ac), mannose (Man), galactose (Gal), or glucosamine (GlcN), administered to pregnant female mice has a similar prophylactic effect on renal hyposialylation, pathology and neonatal survival of mutant offspring, as previously shown for N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) therapy. ManN may be converted to ManNAc by a direct, yet unknown, pathway, or may act through another mode of action. The other sugars (Man, Gal, GlcN) may either not cross the placental barrier (Neu5Ac) and/or may not be able to directly increase sialylation. Because GNE myopathy patients will likely require treatment in adulthood after onset of symptoms, we also administered ManNAc (1 or 2g/kg/day for 12 weeks), Neu5Ac (2 g/kg/day for 12 weeks), or ManN (2 g/kg/day for 6 weeks) in drinking water to 6 month old mutant Gne p.M712T mice. All three therapies markedly improved the muscle and renal hyposialylation, as evidenced by lectin histochemistry for overall sialylation status and immunoblotting of specific sialoproteins. These preclinical data strongly support further evaluation of oral ManNAc, Neu5Ac and ManN as therapy for GNE myopathy and conceivably for certain glomerular diseases with hyposialylation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Autophagy is a vesicular trafficking pathway that regulates the degradation of aggregated proteins and damaged organelles. Initiation of autophagy requires several multiprotein signaling complexes, such as the ULK1 kinase complex and the Vps34 lipid kinase complex, which generates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] on the forming autophagosomal membrane. Alterations in autophagy have been reported for various diseases, including myopathies. Here we show that skeletal muscle autophagy is compromised in mice deficient in the X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM)-associated PtdIns(3)P phosphatase myotubularin (MTM1). Mtm1-deficient muscle displays several cellular abnormalities, including a profound increase in ubiquitin aggregates and abnormal mitochondria. Further, we show that Mtm1 deficiency is accompanied by activation of mTORC1 signaling, which persists even following starvation. In vivo pharmacological inhibition of mTOR is sufficient to normalize aberrant autophagy and improve muscle phenotypes in Mtm1 null mice. These results suggest that aberrant mTORC1 signaling and impaired autophagy are consequences of the loss of Mtm1 and may play a primary role in disease pathogenesis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotubularin MTM1 is a phosphoinositide (PPIn) 3-phosphatase mutated in X-linked centronuclear myopathy (XLCNM; myotubular myopathy). We investigated the involvement of MTM1 enzymatic activity on XLCNM phenotypes. Exogenous expression of human MTM1 in yeast resulted in vacuolar enlargement, as a consequence of its phosphatase activity. Expression of mutants from patients with different clinical progression and determination of PtdIns3P and PtdIns5P cellular levels confirmed the link between vacuolar morphology and MTM1 phosphatase activity, and showed that some disease mutants retain phosphatase activity. Viral gene transfer of phosphatase-dead myotubularin mutants (MTM1(C375S) and MTM1(S376N)) significantly improved most histological signs of XLCNM displayed by a Mtm1-null mouse, at similar levels as wild-type MTM1. Moreover, the MTM1(C375S) mutant improved muscle performance and restored the localization of nuclei, triad alignment, and the desmin intermediate filament network, while it did not normalize PtdIns3P levels, supporting phosphatase-independent roles of MTM1 in maintaining normal muscle performance and organelle positioning in skeletal muscle. Among the different XLCNM signs investigated, we identified only triad shape and fiber size distribution as being partially dependent on MTM1 phosphatase activity. In conclusion, this work uncovers MTM1 roles in the structural organization of muscle fibers that are independent of its enzymatic activity. This underlines that removal of enzymes should be used with care to conclude on the physiological importance of their activity.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome is an autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia, characterised by cerebellar ataxia, myopathy, cataracts and intellectual disability, due to mutations in the SIL1 gene. METHODS: The clinical features and two novel SIL1 mutations of four Dutch patients with Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome are described and compared to the literature on genetically proven Marinesco-Sjögren patients. RESULTS: The core phenotype of this syndrome appears homogeneous, but: [1] cataract can develop later than the motor and cognitive signs; [2] myopathy is an early feature that seems progressive during the course of the disease; [3] serum creatine kinase is normal or only mildly elevated; [4] peripheral neuropathy is absent; and [5] a variable degree of intellectual disability is present in most Marinesco-Sjögren patients. CONCLUSIONS: Because the late appearance of some hallmarks and the uncertainty as to whether incomplete phenotypes occur, SIL1 mutation analysis is helpful early in the diagnostic work-up of children with suspected inherited ataxias.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Most of the previously described pathogenic mutations in desmin are located in highly conserved α-helical domains that play an important role in intermediate filament assembly. The role of the C-terminus non-α-helical 'tail' domain is much less investigated and until recently mutations in this domain have been implicated in only a few patients. The majority of reported desminopathy cases caused by the tail mutations were sporadic, creating a representation bias regarding the disease frequency and phenotypic characteristics. METHODS: We performed detailed genotype-phenotype analysis of autosomal dominant desminopathy associated with tail domain mutations in a four-generation autosomal dominant family with 16 members affected by a progressive cardiac and/or skeletal myopathy caused by a c.1346A>C (p.Lys449Thr) mutation located in the tail domain of desmin. RESULTS: Phenotypic features in patients with tail domain mutations are similar to those in patients with mutations localized in the 1B and 2B α-helical domains. CONCLUSION: We recommend that the tail domain is searched for mutations as intensely as desmin coil domains which until recently were considered to be more 'functional'.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Defects in the desmin gene have been identified in patients with cardiac and skeletal myopathy characterized by sarcoplasmic accumulation of desmin-positive deposits and electron dense granulofilamentous aggregates. We describe a desminopathy family with unusual clinical features of complete atrioventricular block and mild myopathy. The atrioventricular block can be found in each of the affected members sparing of the detectable cardiac structural abnormalities through echocardiogram. A novel heterozygous deletion-insertion mutation (c.1045-1063 del/G ins), deleting 7 amino acid (Met349-Arg355) and inserting 1 amino acid (Gly349) in a highly conserved alpha-helical 2B domain of desmin, has been identified. The results of this study indicate that atrioventricular conduction block without cardiac structural abnormalities may be an intrinsic feature of disease associated with specific desmin mutation. Furthermore atrioventricular conduction block may be an exclusive clinical manifestation and a major cause of disability and death in some patients with desmiopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: ISCU myopathy is a disease caused by muscle-specific deficiency of the Fe-S cluster scaffold protein ISCU. RESULTS: MyoD expression enhanced ISCU mRNA mis-splicing, and oxidative stress exacerbated ISCU depletion in patient cells. CONCLUSION: ISCU protein deficiency in patients results from muscle-specific mis-splicing as well as oxidative stress. SIGNIFICANCE: Oxidative stress negatively influences the mammalian Fe-S cluster assembly machinery by destabilization of ISCU. Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster cofactors are formed on the scaffold protein ISCU. ISCU myopathy is a disease caused by an intronic mutation that leads to abnormally spliced ISCU mRNA. We found that two predominant mis-spliced ISCU mRNAs produce a truncated and short-lived ISCU protein product in multiple patient cell types. Expression of the muscle-specific transcription factor MyoD further diminished normal splicing of ISCU mRNA in patient myoblasts, demonstrating that the process of muscle differentiation enhances the loss of normal ISCU mRNA splicing. ISCU protein was nearly undetectable in patient skeletal muscle, but was higher in patient myoblasts, fibroblasts, and lymphoblasts. We next treated patient cells with pro-oxidants to mimic the oxidative stress associated with muscle activity. Brief hydrogen peroxide treatment or incubation in an enriched oxygen atmosphere led to a marked further reduction of ISCU protein levels, which could be prevented by pretreatment with the antioxidant ascorbate. Thus, we conclude that skeletal muscle differentiation of patient cells causes a higher degree of abnormal ISCU splicing and that oxidative stress resulting from skeletal muscle work destabilizes the small amounts of normal ISCU protein generated in patient skeletal muscles.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Valosin containing protein (VCP) mutations are the cause of hereditary inclusion body myopathy, Paget's disease of bone, frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). VCP gene mutations have also been linked to 2% of isolated familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). VCP is at the intersection of disrupted ubiquitin proteasome and autophagy pathways, mechanisms responsible for the intracellular protein degradation and abnormal pathology seen in muscle, brain and spinal cord. We have developed the homozygous knock-in VCP mouse (VCP(R155H/R155H)) model carrying the common R155H mutations, which develops many clinical features typical of the VCP-associated human diseases. Homozygote VCP(R155H/R155H) mice typically survive less than 21 days, exhibit weakness and myopathic changes on EMG. MicroCT imaging of the bones reveal non-symmetrical radiolucencies of the proximal tibiae and bone, highly suggestive of PDB. The VCP(R155H/R155H) mice manifest prominent muscle, heart, brain and spinal cord pathology, including striking mitochondrial abnormalities, in addition to disrupted autophagy and ubiquitin pathologies. The VCP(R155H/R155H) homozygous mouse thus represents an accelerated model of VCP disease and can be utilized to elucidate the intricate molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of VCP-associated neurodegenerative diseases and for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Many mutations in the skeletal muscle α-actin gene (ACTA1) lead to muscle weakness and nemaline myopathy. Despite increasing clinical and scientific interest, the molecular and cellular pathogenesis of weakness remains unclear. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed at unraveling these mechanisms using muscles from a transgenic mouse model of nemaline myopathy expressing the ACTA1 Asp286Gly mutation. We recorded and analyzed the mechanics of membrane-permeabilized single muscle fibers. We also performed molecular energy state computations in the presence or absence of Asp286Gly. Results demonstrated that during contraction, the Asp286Gly acts as a "poison-protein" and according to the computational analysis it modifies the actin-actin interface. This phenomenon is likely to prevent proper myosin cross-bridge binding, limiting the fraction of actomyosin interactions in the strong binding state. At the cell level, this decreases the force-generating capacity, and, overall, induces muscle weakness. To counterbalance such negative events, future potential therapeutic strategies may focus on the inappropriate actin-actin interface or myosin binding.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Defects of mitochondrial protein synthesis are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. We previously described a male infant who was born to consanguineous parents and who presented with severe congenital encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, and lactic acidosis associated with deficiencies of multiple mitochondrial respiratory-chain enzymes and defective mitochondrial translation. In this work, we have characterized four additional affected family members, performed homozygosity mapping, and identified a homozygous splicing mutation in the splice donor site of exon 2 (c.504+1G>A) of RMND1 (required for meiotic nuclear division-1) in the affected individuals. Fibroblasts from affected individuals expressed two aberrant transcripts and had decreased wild-type mRNA and deficiencies of mitochondrial respiratory-chain enzymes. The RMND1 mutation caused haploinsufficiency that was rescued by overexpression of the wild-type transcript in mutant fibroblasts; this overexpression increased the levels and activities of mitochondrial respiratory-chain proteins. Knockdown of RMND1 via shRNA recapitulated the biochemical defect of the mutant fibroblasts, further supporting a loss-of-function pathomechanism in this disease. RMND1 belongs to the sif2 family, an evolutionary conserved group of proteins that share the DUF155 domain, have unknown function, and have never been associated with human disease. We documented that the protein localizes to mitochondria in mammalian and yeast cells. Further studies are necessary for understanding the function of this protein in mitochondrial protein translation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Alcohol-related myopathy (Alc-M) is highly prevalent among heavy drinkers, although its pathogenesis is not well understood. We hypothesize that Alc-M is mediated by combined effects of insulin/IGF resistance and oxidative stress, similar to the effects of ethanol on liver and brain. We tested this hypothesis using an established model in which adult rats were pair-fed for 8 weeks with isocaloric diets containing 0% (N = 8) or 35.5% (N = 13) ethanol by caloric content. Gastrocnemius muscles were examined by histology, morphometrics, qRT-PCR analysis, and ELISAs. Chronic ethanol feeding reduced myofiber size and mRNA expression of IGF-1 polypeptide, insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2 receptors, IRS-1, and IRS-2. Multiplex ELISAs demonstrated ethanol-associated inhibition of insulin, IRS-1, Akt, and p70S6K signaling, and increased activation of GSK-3β. In addition, ethanol-exposed muscles had increased 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal immunoreactivity, reflecting lipid peroxidation, and reduced levels of mitochondrial Complex IV, Complex V, and acetylcholinesterase. These results demonstrate that experimental Alc-M is associated with inhibition of insulin/IGF/IRS and downstream signaling that mediates metabolism and cell survival, similar to findings in alcoholic liver and brain degeneration. Moreover, the increased oxidative stress, which could be mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction, may have led to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, which itself is sufficient to cause myofiber atrophy and degeneration.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The mechanisms of alcohol-related peripheral neuropathy (ALPN) are poorly understood. We hypothesize that, like alcohol-related liver and brain degeneration, ALPN may be mediated by combined effects of insulin/IGF resistance and oxidative stress. Adult male Long Evans rats were chronically pair-fed with diets containing 0% or 37% ethanol (caloric), and subjected to nerve conduction studies. Chronic ethanol feeding slowed nerve conduction in the tibial (p = 0.0021) motor nerve, and not plantar sensory nerve, but it did not affect amplitude. Histological studies of the sciatic nerve revealed reduced nerve fiber diameters with increased regenerative sprouts, and denervation myopathy in ethanol-fed rats. qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated reduced mRNA levels of insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2 polypeptides, IGF-1 receptor, and IRS2, and ELISAs revealed reduced immunoreactivity for insulin and IGF-1 receptors, IRS-1, IRS-4, myelin-associated glycoprotein, and tau in sciatic nerves of ethanol-fed rats (all p &lt; 0.05 or better). The findings suggest that ALPN is characterized by (1) slowed conduction velocity with demyelination, and a small component of axonal degeneration; (2) impaired trophic factor signaling due to insulin and IGF resistance; and (3) degeneration of myelin and axonal cytoskeletal proteins. Therefore, ALPN is likely mediated by molecular and signal transduction abnormalities similar to those identified in alcoholic liver and brain degeneration.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>INTRODUCTION: Inclusion-body myopathy (IBM) with Paget's disease of bone (PDB) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), designated as IBMPFD, is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder (MIM 605382). IBMPFD is caused by mutations in the gene that encode valosin-containing protein (VCP). We investigated a Chinese family in which multiple members were diagnosed with PDB and suffered from weakness of the limbs. However, no members of this family were diagnosed with FTD. We made a preliminary diagnosis of PDB, but failed to identify an SQSTM1 mutation in any of the patients. We used whole-exome sequencing to identify the pathogenic gene mutation affecting the Chinese male proband. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Altogether, 254 subjects, including one 56-year-old male proband, four affected, related individuals and additional nine family members from a non-consanguineous Chinese family, and 240 healthy donors were recruited and genomic DNA was extracted. All eight exons and the exon-intron boundaries of the SQSTM1 gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and directly sequenced in five patients (II13, II4, II5, II8, II9). Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a novel mutation in VCP as the disease-causing mutation. We confirmed the result by sequencing a 500-bp region of the promoter and the coding region of VCP in all 254 of the participants using Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: No mutation in the SQSTM1 gene was identified in the five patients examined using direct Sanger sequencing. However, through whole-exome sequencing we were able to identify a novel missense mutation in exon 3 of the VCP gene (p.Gly97Glu) in the Chinese male proband. This mutation was confirmed using Sanger sequencing. The proband, four affected individuals and three unaffected individuals carried this mutation. We were able to correctly diagnose the patients with atypical IBMPFD. Structural analysis of the p.Gly97Glu mutation in the VCP protein showed that the affected amino-acid is located in the interface of the protein. This abnormality may therefore interfere with protein function. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a family from China with IBMPFD. A novel VCP mutation was found as the cause of atypical IBMPFD in a Chinese family. Our findings confirm that VCP gene mutations can be a pathogenic cause of IBMPFD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Tarui disease is a glycogen storage disease (GSD VII) and characterized by exercise intolerance with muscle weakness and cramping, mild myopathy, myoglobinuria and compensated hemolysis. It is caused by mutations in the muscle 6-phosphofructokinase (Pfk). Pfk is an oligomeric, allosteric enzyme which catalyzes one of the rate-limiting steps of the glycolysis: the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate at position 1. Pfk activity is modulated by a number of regulators including adenine nucleotides. Recent crystal structures from eukaryotic Pfk displayed several allosteric adenine nucleotide binding sites. Functional studies revealed a reciprocal linkage between the activating and inhibitory allosteric binding sites. Herein, we showed that Asp(543)Ala, a naturally occurring disease-causing mutation in the activating binding site, causes an increased efficacy of ATP at the inhibitory allosteric binding site. The reciprocal linkage between the activating and inhibitory binding sites leads to reduced enzyme activity and therefore to the clinical phenotype. Pharmacological blockage of the inhibitory allosteric binding site or highly efficient ligands for the activating allosteric binding site may be of therapeutic relevance for patients with Tarui disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The lack of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), a patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing enzyme that hydrolyzes fatty acids from triacylglycerol (TAG) stored in multiple tissues, causes the autosomal recessive disorder neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy (NLSD-M). In two families of Lebanese and Italian origin presenting with NLSD-M, we identified two new missense mutations in highly conserved regions of ATGL (p.Arg221Pro and p.Asn172Lys) and a novel nonsense mutation (p.Trp8X). The Lebanese patients harbor homozygous p.Arg221Pro, whereas the Italian patients are heterozygotes for p.Asn172Lys and the p.Trp8X mutation. The p.Trp8X mutation results in a complete absence of ATGL protein, while the p.Arg221Pro and p.Asn172Lys mutations result in proteins with minimal lipolytic activity. Although these mutations did not affect putative catalytic residues or the lipid droplet (LD)-binding domain of ATGL, cytosolic LDs accumulated in cultured skin fibroblasts from the patients. The missense mutations might destabilize a random coil (p.Asn172Lys) or a helix (p.Arg221Pro) structure within or proximal to the patatin domain of the lipase, thereby interfering with the enzyme activity, while leaving intact the residues required to localize the protein to LDs. Overexpressing wild-type ATGL in one patient's fibroblasts corrected the metabolic defect and effectively reduced the number and area of cellular LDs. Despite the poor lipase activity in vitro, the Lebanese siblings have a mild myopathy and not clinically evident myocardial dysfunction. The patients of Italian origin show a late-onset and slowly progressive skeletal myopathy. These findings suggest that a small amount of correctly localized lipase activity preserves cardiac function in NLSD-M.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Anoctaminopathy is a new muscular dystrophy caused by mutations in the ANO5 gene. ANO5 mutations cause distal and proximal phenotypes. We report here a follow-up muscle MRI study on five patients affected by distal form of anoctaminopathy. T1 weighted scans showed subsequent involvement of gastrocnemius medialis and soleus, hip adductors, hamstrings, gastrocnemius lateralis and quadriceps muscles, and later on tensor fascia lata, gluteus minimus and biceps brachii muscles, respectively. The STIR weighted images showed in the early stages widely distributed hyperintense signals, myoedema, in the adductors, hamstrings, and quadriceps muscles, which at that time have normal T1 signals. All patients showed asymmetry of muscle involvement both clinically and on muscle imaging. The progression of muscle involvement was relatively slow. We conclude that the pattern of muscle involvement seen in patients with distal myopathy with anoctamin 5 mutations (MMD3) is typical and can thus be useful during the differential diagnosis process allowing for a more targeted molecular approach.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) is a common form of muscular dystrophy associated with defects in collagen VI. It is characterized by loss of individual muscle fibers and muscle mass and proliferation of connective and adipose tissues. We sought to investigate the mechanisms by which collagen VI regulates muscle cell survival, size, and regeneration and, in particular, the potential role of the ubiquitin-proteasome and calpain-proteolytic systems. We studied muscle biopsies of UCMD (n = 6), other myopathy (n = 12), and control patients (n = 10) and found reduced expression of atrogin-1, MURF1, and calpain-3 mRNAs in UCMD cases. Downregulation of calpain-3 was associated with changes in the nuclear immunolocalization of nuclear factor-κB. We also observed increased expression versus controls of regeneration markers at the protein and RNA levels. Satellite cell numbers did not differ in collagen VI-deficient muscle versus normal nonregenerating muscle, indicating that collagen VI does not play a key role in the maintenance of the satellite cell pool. Our results indicate that alterations in calpain-3 and nuclear factor-κB signaling pathways may contribute to muscle mass loss in UCMD muscle, whereas atrogin-1 and MURF1 are not likely to play a major role.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotubular myopathy (MIM#310400), the X-linked form of Centronuclear myopathy (CNM) is mainly characterized by neonatal hypotonia and inability to maintain unassisted respiration. The MTM1 gene, responsible for this disease, encodes myotubularin - a lipidic phosphatase involved in vesicle trafficking regulation and maturation. Recently, it was shown that myotubularin interacts with desmin, being a major regulator of intermediate filaments. We report the development of a locus-specific database for MTM1 using the Leiden Open Variation database software (http://www.lovd.nl/MTM1), with data collated for 474 mutations identified in 472 patients (by June 2012). Among the entries are a total of 25 new mutations, including a large deletion encompassing introns 2-15. During database implementation it was noticed that no large duplications had been reported. We tested a group of eight uncharacterized CNM patients for this specific type of mutation, by multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis. A large duplication spanning exons 1-5 was identified in a boy with a mild phenotype, with results pointing toward possible somatic mosaicism. Further characterization revealed that this duplication causes an in-frame deletion at the mRNA level (r.343_444del). Results obtained with a next generation sequencing approach suggested that the duplication extends into the neighboring MAMLD1 gene and subsequent cDNA analysis detected the presence of a MTM1/MAMLD1 fusion transcript. A complex rearrangement involving the duplication of exon 10 has since been reported, with detection also enabled by MLPA analysis. It is thus conceivable that large duplications in MTM1 may account for a number of CNM cases that have remained genetically unresolved.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Familial visceral myopathy (FVM) is a rare inherited form of myopathic pseudo-obstruction; little is known about the genetic factors that cause this disorder. FVM is characterized by impaired functions of enteric smooth muscle cells, resulting in abnormal intestinal motility, severe abdominal pain, malnutrition, and even death. We searched for genetic factors that might cause this disorder. METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequence analysis of blood samples from 2 individuals in a family that had 7 members diagnosed with FVM. Sanger sequencing was used to analyze additional family members and 280 individuals without this disorder (controls). Intestinal tissue samples from 4 patients and 2 controls were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Functional studies, including immunofluorescence, cell contractility, and actomyosin structure analyses, were performed using CRL-1976 and U2OS sarcoma cell lines. RESULTS: Whole-exome sequence analysis of DNA from 2 siblings identified 83 gene variants that were shared between the siblings and considered as possible disease-causing changes. A heterozygous variant, R148S in enteric smooth muscle actin γ-2 (ACTG2), segregated with disease phenotype. Intestinal smooth muscle (muscularis propria) from individuals with FVM had reduced levels of cytoplasmic ACTG2 and abnormal accumulation of the protein into intracellular inclusions compared with controls. Sarcoma cells that expressed exogenous ACTG2(R148S) incorporated reduced amounts of this protein into actin filaments compared with cells expressing ACTG2(wt) (P &lt; .001). ACTG2(R148S) also interfered with actin cytoskeleton organization and the contractile activities of the cells, indicating a dominant-negative effect. These findings, along with the site of the variation in the protein, indicate that ACTG2 R148S interferes with actin filament assembly. CONCLUSIONS: We identified the R148S variant in ACTG2 as a cause of FVM in one family. The altered ACTG2 protein appears to aggregate, rather than form actin filaments, in intestinal smooth muscle tissue. This defect could impair contraction of the visceral smooth muscle cells and reduce bowel motility.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>INTRODUCTION: Nebulin is a large actin-binding protein of the skeletal muscle sarcomere. Multiple isoforms of nebulin are produced from the 183-exon-containing nebulin gene (NEB). Mutations in NEB cause nemaline myopathy, distal myopathy, and core-rod myopathy. METHODS: Nebulin mRNA expression was assessed by microarrays and RT-PCR in 21 human leg muscle and 2 brain samples. Protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 5 regions of 1 brain sample. RESULTS: Nebulin isoform diversity is as high in brain as in skeletal muscle. Isoforms with more than 22 super repeats seem to be more common than previously anticipated. Immunohistochemistry showed nebulin expression predominantly in the cytoplasm of pyramidal neurons but also in the cytoplasm of mainly subcortical endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Nebulin, as in skeletal muscle, may have a role as an actin filament stabilizer or length regulator in neurons of the human brain, although patients with NEB mutations usually have normal cognition.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Centronuclear myopathy (CNM) is a rare inherited neuromuscular disorder characterized by centrally placed nuclei in striated muscle. In this report, we describe the histological changes in the extraocular muscle (EOM) from a CNM patient with a mutation in Dynamic 2 (DNM2). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 33-year-old Caucasian female presented with horizontal diplopia and left exotropia for 6 months prior to which she was asymptomatic. Her past medical history was significant for CNM, diagnosed based on a left quadriceps biopsy with onset of lower extremity weakness in her late 20s. She underwent a left medial rectus (LMR) resection and a left lateral rectus (LLR) recession. The resected muscle was analyzed using light and electron microscopy. Screening for mutations in the DNM2 gene was carried out and the detected mutation was confirmed by direct sequencing. Expression of the DNM2 protein was performed using immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: Pathology of the EOM revealed 17% centrally located muscle nuclei in contrast to 90% in the quadriceps, variable fiber size, normal ultrastructure of the EOM and normal distribution of DNM2 by IHC. Genetic analysis revealed a heterozygous R369W mutation in the DNM2 gene. CONCLUSION: The histological changes in the EOM in this CNM patient were mild, which reflected the mild alterations in function seen in this patient. The ophthalmologist seeing patients with new onset strabismus and a history of a myopathy should consider this entity in the differential diagnosis that could be confirmed by a muscle biopsy and mutational analysis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: X-linked myopathy with postural muscle atrophy is a novel X-linked myopathy caused by mutations in the four-and-a-half LIM domain 1 gene (FHL1). Cardiac involvement was suspected in initial publications. We now systematically analyzed the association of the FHL1 genotype with the cardiac phenotype to establish a potential cardiac involvement in the disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seventeen male patients and 23 female mutation carriers were compared with healthy controls. Every patient underwent a comprehensive clinical and cardiovascular workup. ECG abnormalities occurred frequently in affected males and were less frequent in heterozygous females. Both male and female mutation carriers had increased myocardial mass (affected males=115.1±25.3 g/m(2); heterozygous females=95.1±19.6 g/m(2); controls=89.0±15.6 g/m(2) and 72.6±12.6 g/m(2); respectively) with increased wall thickness (typically midventricular and apical segments) mainly in affected males. Longitudinal systolic function was reduced in affected males (radial systolic strain: affected males=24.6±11.8%; male controls=43.2±14.8%; P=0.002). Diastolic dysfunction occurred in both affected males and heterozygous females. Cardiac MRI revealed a morphological hallmark of X-linked myopathy with postural muscle atrophy; a characteristic spongious structure and replacement fibrosis indicated by late enhancement could be detected in most affected males. X-linked myopathy with postural muscle atrophy was associated with reduced exercise capacity in affected males but not in heterozygous female mutation carriers. CONCLUSIONS: X-linked myopathy with postural muscle atrophy patients consistently showed electrical, functional, and characteristic morphological cardiac abnormalities that translate into reduced exercise capacity. Reduced systolic and diastolic function is associated with a novel type of spongious hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. An unexpected finding was that some cardiac abnormalities were also present in heterozygous female mutation carriers.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>MutS homologs play a central role in maintaining genetic stability. We show that MSH5 (MutSHomolog 5) is localized into the mitochondria of germ and somatic cells. This protein binds to mtDNA and interacts with the Twinkle helicase and the DNA polymerase gamma. hMSH5 stimulates mtDNA repair in response to DNA damage induced by oxidative stress. Furthermore, we observed a subsarcolemmal accumulation of hMSH5 in COX negative muscle fibers of patients presenting a mitochondrial myopathy. We report a novel localization for hMSH5 suggesting that this protein may have functions other than those known in meiotic recombination.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The phenotype of IBMPFD [inclusion body myopathy with Paget's disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)] associated with valosin-containing protein (VCP) mutation is described in three families. METHODS: Probands were identified based on a pathological diagnosis of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43-positive inclusions type IV. VCP sequencing was carried out. Clinical data on affected family members were reviewed. RESULTS: Ohio family: four subjects presented muscle weakness and wasting. (One subject had both neuropathic and myopathic findings and another subject showed only evidence of myopathy. The etiology of weakness could not be ascertained in the remaining two subjects.) Two individuals also showed Parkinsonism (with associated FTD in one of the two). The proband's brain displayed FTLD-TDP type IV and Braak stage five Parkinson's disease (PD). A VCP R191Q mutation was found. Pennsylvania family: 11 subjects developed IBMPFD. Parkinsonism was noted in two mutation carriers, whilst another subject presented with primary progressive aphasia (PPA). A novel VCP T262A mutation was found. Indiana family: three subjects developed IBMPFD. FTD was diagnosed in two individuals and suspected in the third one who also displayed muscle weakness. A VCP R159C mutation was found. CONCLUSIONS: We identified three families with IBMPFD associated with VCP mutations. Clinical and pathological PD was documented for the first time in members of two families. A novel T262A mutation was found. One individual had PPA: an uncommon presentation of IBMPFD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The gene GNE encodes a bifunctional enzyme, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase. Its mutations are found in distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV) and hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM). Those disorders are characterized clinically by predominant anterior tibial muscle weakness and atrophy, and pathologically by rimmed vacuoles on muscle biopsy. We analyzed 11 Korean patients with GNE mutations. The mutations showed ethnic similarity to those of Japanese patients, showing the highest frequency with V572L. Another mutation of C13S was also found recurring in our patient group. Interestingly, about half of the patients showed limb-girdle myopathy rather than distal myopathy. This was further represented by limb muscle CT scans revealing atrophic hamstring and relatively spared anterior tibial muscle. However, quadriceps muscles were consistently spared both in distal and limb-girdle phenotypes. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a phenotypic diversity associated with GNE mutations. Recognizing a wider clinical spectrum of GNE mutations will help benefit more patients with imminent new therapy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a multisystemic disease caused by CTG or CCTG expansion mutations. There is strong evidence that DM1 CUG and DM2 CCUG expansion transcripts sequester muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins and that loss of MBNL function causes alternative splicing abnormalities that contribute to disease. Because MBNL1 loss is thought to play an important role in disease and localized AAV delivery of MBNL1 partially rescues skeletal muscle pathology in DM mice, there is strong interest in MBNL1 overexpression as a therapeutic strategy. We developed the first transgenic MBNL1 overexpression mouse model (MBNL1-OE) to test the safety and efficacy of multisystemic MBNL1 overexpression. First, we demonstrate that MBNL1 overexpression is generally well-tolerated in skeletal muscle. Second, we show the surprising result that premature shifts in alternative splicing of MBNL1-regulated genes in multiple organ systems are compatible with life and do not cause embryonic lethality. Third, we show for the first time that early and long-term MBNL1 overexpression prevents CUG-induced myotonia, myopathy and alternative splicing abnormalities in DM1 mice. In summary, MBNL1 overexpression may be a valuable strategy for treating the skeletal muscle features of DM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked myotubular myopathy is a severe congenital myopathy caused by deficiency of the lipid phosphatase, myotubularin. Recent studies of human tissue and animal models have discovered structural and physiological abnormalities in myotubularin-deficient muscle, but the impact of myotubularin deficiency on myogenic stem cells within muscles is unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the viability, proliferative capacity, and in vivo engraftment of myogenic cells obtained from severely symptomatic (Mtm1δ4) myotubularin-deficient mice. Mtm1δ4 muscle contains fewer myogenic cells than wild-type (WT) littermates, and the number of myogenic cells decreases with age. The behavior of Mtm1δ4 myoblasts is also abnormal, because they engraft poorly into C57BL/6/Rag1null/mdx5cv mice and display decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis compared with WT myoblasts. Evaluation of Mtm1δ4 animals at 21 and 42 days of life detected fewer satellite cells in Mtm1δ4 muscle compared with WT littermates, and the decrease in satellite cells correlated with progression of disease. In addition, analysis of WT and Mtm1δ4 regeneration after injury detected similar abnormalities of satellite cell function, with fewer satellite cells, fewer dividing cells, and increased apoptotic cells in Mtm1δ4 muscle. These studies demonstrate specific abnormalities in myogenic cell number and behavior that may relate to the progression of disease in myotubularin deficiency, and may also be used to develop in vitro assays by which novel treatment strategies can be assessed.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy (NLSDM) referred to those neutral lipid storage disease (NLSD) patients with myopathy but without ichthyosis. Recently, NLSDM has been attributed to mutations in the PNPLA2 gene. Until now, 19 patients with PNPLA2 mutations have been reported. In the present study, we describe the clinical and genetic findings in three Chinese patients with NLSDM. Sequence analysis of PNPLA2 gene was performed. In our patients we identified four novel mutations in the PNPLA2 gene including two splicing mutations. The identification and study of mutations found in PNPLA2 is also particularly important to define the clinical spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlations of the PNPLA2 gene.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Congenital myopathies are clinically and genetically heterogeneous diseases that typically present in childhood with hypotonia and weakness and are most commonly defined by changes observed in muscle biopsy. Approximately 40% of congenital myopathies are currently genetically unresolved. We identified a family with dominantly inherited congenital myopathy characterized by distal weakness and biopsy changes that included core-like areas and increased internalized nuclei. To identify the causative genetic abnormality in this family, we performed linkage analysis followed by whole-exome capture and next-generation sequencing. A splice-acceptor variant in previously uncharacterized CCDC78 was detected in affected individuals and absent in unaffected family members and > 10,000 controls. This variant alters RNA-transcript processing and results in a 222 bp in-frame insertion. CCDC78 is expressed in skeletal muscle, enriched in the perinuclear region and the triad, and found in intracellular aggregates in patient muscle. Modeling of the CCDC78 mutation in zebrafish resulted in changes mirroring the human disease that included altered motor function and abnormal muscle ultrastructure. Using a combination of linkage analysis, next-generation sequencing, and modeling in the zebrafish, we have identified a CCDC78 mutation associated with a unique myopathy with prominent internal nuclei and atypical cores.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Celiac disease (CD) is frequently associated with neurological disorders, but very few reports concern the association with ischemic stroke. A 26-year-old woman affected by CD with secondary amenorrhea, carrier of a homozygous 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutation with hyperhomocysteinemia, was affected by two occipital ischemic strokes within a period of 5 mo. At the time of the second stroke, while she was being treated with folic acid, acetylsalicylic acid and a gluten-free diet, she had left hemianopsia, left hemiparesthesias, and gait imbalance. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a subacute right occipital ischemic lesion, which was extended to the dorsal region of the right thalamus and the ipsilateral thalamo-capsular junction. Antitransglutaminase and deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies were no longer present, while antinuclear antibodies, antineuronal antibodies and immune circulating complexes were only slightly elevated. Since the patient was taking folic acid, her homocysteine ​​levels were almost normal and apparently not sufficient alone to explain the clinical event. A conventional cerebral angiography showed no signs of vasculitis. Finally, rare causes of occipital stroke in young patients, such as Fabry's disease and mitochondrial myopathy, encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like symptoms, were also excluded by appropriate tests. Thus, the most probable cause for the recurrent strokes in this young woman remained CD, although the mechanisms involved are still unknown. The two main hypotheses concern malabsorption (with consequent deficiency of vitamins known to exert neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects) and immune-mediated mechanisms. CD should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of ischemic stroke in young patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: It is generally believed that muscle weakness in patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis is due to autoimmune and inflammatory processes. However, it has been observed that there is a poor correlation between the suppression of inflammation and a recovery of muscle function in these patients. This study was undertaken to examine whether nonimmune mechanisms also contribute to muscle weakness. In particular, it has been suggested that an acquired deficiency of AMP deaminase 1 (AMPD1) may be responsible for muscle weakness in myositis. METHODS: We performed comprehensive functional, behavioral, histologic, molecular, enzymatic, and metabolic assessments before and after the onset of inflammation in a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-transgenic mouse model of autoimmune inflammatory myositis. RESULTS: Muscle weakness and metabolic disturbances were detectable in the mice prior to the appearance of infiltrating mononuclear cells. Force contraction analysis of muscle function revealed that weakness was correlated with AMPD1 expression and was myositis specific. Decreasing AMPD1 expression resulted in decreased muscle strength in healthy mice. Fiber typing suggested that fast-twitch muscles were converted to slow-twitch muscles as myositis progressed, and microarray results indicated that AMPD1 and other purine nucleotide pathway genes were suppressed, along with genes essential to glycolysis. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that an AMPD1 deficiency is acquired prior to overt muscle inflammation and is responsible, at least in part, for the muscle weakness that occurs in the mouse model of myositis. AMPD1 is therefore a potential therapeutic target in myositis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), the most prevalent myopathy afflicting both children and adults, is predominantly associated with contractions in the 4q35-localized macrosatellite D4Z4 repeat array. Recent studies have proposed that FSHD pathology is caused by the misexpression of the DUX4 (double homeobox 4) gene resulting in production of a pathogenic protein, DUX4-FL, which has been detected in FSHD, but not in unaffected control myogenic cells and muscle tissue. Here, we report the analysis of DUX4 mRNA and protein expression in a much larger collection of myogenic cells and muscle biopsies derived from biceps and deltoid muscles of FSHD affected subjects and their unaffected first-degree relatives. We confirmed that stable DUX4-fl mRNA and protein were expressed in myogenic cells and muscle tissues derived from FSHD affected subjects, including several genetically diagnosed adult FSHD subjects yet to show clinical manifestations of the disease in the assayed muscles. In addition, we report DUX4-fl mRNA and protein expression in muscle biopsies and myogenic cells from genetically unaffected relatives of the FSHD subjects, although at a significantly lower frequency. These results establish that DUX4-fl expression per se is not sufficient for FSHD muscle pathology and indicate that quantitative modifiers of DUX4-fl expression and/or function and family genetic background are determinants of FSHD muscle disease progression.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In humans, congenital myopathy-linked tropomyosin mutations lead to skeletal muscle dysfunction, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying such dysfunction remain obscure. Recent studies have suggested a unifying mechanism by which tropomyosin mutations partially inhibit thin filament activation and prevent proper formation and cycling of myosin cross-bridges, inducing force deficits at the fiber and whole-muscle levels. Here, we aimed to verify this mechanism using single membrane-permeabilized fibers from patients with three tropomyosin mutations (TPM2-null, TPM3-R167H and TPM2-E181K) and measuring a broad range of parameters. Interestingly, we identified two divergent, mutation-specific pathophysiological mechanisms. (i) The TPM2-null and TPM3-R167H mutations both decreased cooperative thin filament activation in combination with reductions in the myosin cross-bridge number and force production. The TPM3-R167H mutation also induced a concomitant reduction in thin filament length. (ii) In contrast, the TPM2-E181K mutation increased thin filament activation, cross-bridge binding and force generation. In the former mechanism, modulating thin filament activation by administering troponin activators (CK-1909178 and EMD 57033) to single membrane-permeabilized fibers carrying tropomyosin mutations rescued the thin filament activation defect associated with the pathophysiology. Therefore, administration of troponin activators may constitute a promising therapeutic approach in the future.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the valosin-containing-protein (VCP) gene are associated with the multidisorder disease, inclusion body myopathy with Pagets and associated frontotemporal dementia. This disease is characterized pathologically by large ubiquitinated, TAR DNA Binding Protein 43 (TDP-43) positive inclusions. These inclusions are also a common feature in neurological diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTLD). Mutations in the VCP gene have been identified in ALS patients, therefore we aimed to characterize VCP variations in our own cohort of familial and sporadic ALS patients by sequencing all 17 coding exons of VCP. This study failed to detect any exonic variations in a subset of British familial and sporadic ALS patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Congenital myopathies describe a group of inherited muscle disorders with neonatal or infantile onset typically associated with muscle weakness, respiratory involvement and delayed motor milestones. We previously reported a novel congenital myopathy in an inbred Samaritan family. All patients displayed severe neonatal hypotonia and respiratory distress, and unlike other congenital myopathies, a constantly improving health status. As clinical and pathological data did not point to preferential candidate genes, we performed exome sequencing complemented by linkage analysis to identify the mutation causing the benign Samaritan congenital myopathy. We identified the homozygous p.Tyr1088Cys mutation in RYR1, encoding the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor. This sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium channel is a key regulator of excitation-contraction coupling (ECC). Western blot and immunohistofluorescence revealed a significant decrease of the RYR1 protein level and an abnormal organization of skeletal muscle triad markers as caveolin-3, dysferlin and amphiphysin 2. RYR1 mutations are associated with different myopathies and malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. The index patient had mild hyperthermia following anesthesia, indicating that the inbred Samaritan population might be a risk group for this disorder. Our results suggest an aberrant ECC as the primary cause of this disease, and broaden the clinical consequences of RYR1 defects.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD) is characterized by abnormal fat distribution and a metabolic syndrome with hypertriglyceridemia. We identified a family with a severe form of FPLD3 with never-reported clinical features and a novel mutation affecting the DNA binding domain of PPARγ (E157D). Apart from the lipodystrophy and severe metabolic syndrome, individuals presented musculoskeletal and hematological issues. E157D heterozygotes had a muscular habitus yet displayed muscle weakness and myopathy. Also, E157D heterozygotes presented multiple cytopenias and a susceptibility to autoimmune disease. In vitro studies showed that the E157D mutation does not decrease the receptor's affinity to classical PPAR response elements or its responsiveness to a PPARγ agonist, yet it severely reduces its target gene transcription. Microarray experiments demonstrated a decreased activation of a wide array of genes, including genes involved in the PPAR response, the immune response, hematopoiesis, and metabolism in muscle. In addition, a subset of genes with cryptic PPAR response elements was activated. In summary, we describe a large family with a novel PPARγ mutation, which extends the clinical phenotype of FPLD3 to include muscular, immune, and hematological features. Together, our results support the role of PPARγ in controlling homeostasis of multiple systems beyond lipid metabolism.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in Bcl-2 associated athanogene-3 (BAG3) are a rare cause of myofibrillar myopathy, characterised by rapidly progressive proximal and axial myopathy, cardiomyopathy and respiratory compromise. Neuropathy has been documented neurophysiologically in previously reported cases of BAG3-associated myofibrillar myopathy and in some cases giant axons were observed on nerve biopsies; however, neuropathy was not thought to be a dominant feature of the disease. In the context of inherited neuropathy, giant axons are typically associated with autosomal recessive giant axonal neuropathy caused by gigaxonin mutations but have also been reported in association with NEFL- and SH3TC2-associated Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Here, we describe four patients with heterozygous BAG3 mutations with clinical evidence of a sensorimotor neuropathy, with predominantly axonal features on neurophysiology. Three patients presented with a significant neuropathy. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in one patient revealed mild to moderate atrophy without prominent selectivity. Examination of sural nerve biopsies in two patients demonstrated giant axons. This report confirms the association of giant axonal neuropathy with BAG3-associated myofibrillar myopathy, and highlights that neuropathy may be a significant feature.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5) is a novel autoantibody frequently characterized by interstitial lung disease and a distinct cutaneous phenotype with palmar papules, ulceration, and rash. Virtually all patients have underlying dermatomyositis, but many lack the characteristic clinical myopathy associated with it. In the setting of amyopathic disease, the absence of clinically available biomarkers or clear pathologic diagnosis can complicate effective prognostic and therapeutic intervention. Until recently the presence of MDA-5 antibody associated dermato-pulmonary syndrome was described only in Asian populations. We present 2 cases of MDA-5-associated dermato-pulmonary syndrome and provide a comprehensive review of available literature.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) is associated with lesions within the dento-rubro-olivary pathway or Guillain-Mollaret triangle and may be associated clinically with palatal tremor. Here we report HOD on brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in three patients with progressive mitochondrial syndromes in the absence of palatal tremor. Two of the patients were found to have identical compound heterozygous mutations in the POLG gene, encoding the catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase-γ, but presented with different clinical phenotypes. The first patient displayed the clinical syndrome of sensory ataxia, neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO), while the second patient was affected by a neurological disorder consisting of an ophthalmoplegia, myopathy, and neuropathy. The third case was a child with Leigh syndrome due to SURF1 gene mutations, who presented with a generalized tremor. We discuss the brain MR imaging findings in these three cases along with a literature review on the MR features of previously reported cases of patients with POLG gene mutations and Leigh disease due to SURF1 gene mutations. Our findings suggest that the presence of HOD, in the appropriate clinical setting, should alert the clinician to the possibility of a mitochondrial disorder and the need to screen for mutations in POLG and SURF1 genes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) is a mitochondrial myopathy of ocular muscles. Diagnostic investigation usually involves limb skeletal muscle biopsy and molecular genetic studies, although diagnostic yield tends to be low. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic yield obtained by analysis of levator palpebrae (LP) muscle tissue. METHODS: This is a clinicopathologic study of 8 patients with a diagnosis of PEO, who had LP muscle biopsies as part of oculoplastic procedures. Six of these patients also had limb muscle biopsies. Histopathology, electron microscopy and genetic studies were performed. Results: Diagnostic histopathologic findings were present in 4/6 quadriceps biopsies, and 7/8 LP biopsies. Genetic testing on DNA extracted from LP muscle revealed abnormalities in 4 patients. CONCLUSION: In patients whose LP. muscle demonstrate both genetic defects and histopathological abnormalities, the diagnosis of PEO can be confirmed without limb muscle biopsy. Patients having LP resection during oculoplastics procedures for treatment of ptosis may therefore be able to avoid a separate procedure for limb muscle biopsy.

<rdfs:comment>The dysferlinopathies comprise a group of untreatable muscle disorders including limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B, Miyoshi myopathy, distal anterior compartment syndrome, and rigid spine syndrome. As with other forms of muscular dystrophy, adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene transfer is a particularly auspicious treatment strategy, however the size of the DYSF cDNA (6.5 kb) negates packaging into traditional AAV serotypes known to express well in muscle (i.e. rAAV1, 2, 6, 8, 9). Potential advantages of a full cDNA versus a mini-gene include: maintaining structural-functional protein domains, evading protein misfolding, and avoiding novel epitopes that could be immunogenic. AAV5 has demonstrated unique plasticity with regards to packaging capacity and recombination of virions containing homologous regions of cDNA inserts has been implicated in the generation of full-length transcripts. Herein we show for the first time in vivo that homologous recombination following AAV5.DYSF gene transfer leads to the production of full length transcript and protein. Moreover, gene transfer of full-length dysferlin protein in dysferlin deficient mice resulted in expression levels sufficient to correct functional deficits in the diaphragm and importantly in skeletal muscle membrane repair. Intravascular regional gene transfer through the femoral artery produced high levels of transduction and enabled targeting of specific muscle groups affected by the dysferlinopathies setting the stage for potential translation to clinical trials. We provide proof of principle that AAV5 mediated delivery of dysferlin is a highly promising strategy for treatment of dysferlinopathies and has far-reaching implications for the therapeutic delivery of other large genes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The formation, distribution, and maintenance of functional mitochondria are achieved through dynamic processes that depend strictly on the transcription of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. A large number of these mitochondrial genes contain binding sites for the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) in their proximal promoters, but the physiological relevance is unknown. We report here that skeletal-muscle-specific YY1 knockout (YY1mKO) mice have severely defective mitochondrial morphology and oxidative function associated with exercise intolerance, signs of mitochondrial myopathy, and short stature. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that the top pathways downregulated in YY1mKO mice were assigned to key metabolic and regulatory mitochondrial genes. This analysis was consistent with a profound decrease in the level of mitochondrial proteins and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) bioenergetic function in these mice. In contrast to the finding for wild-type mice, inactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) did not suppress mitochondrial genes in YY1mKO mice. Mechanistically, mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of YY1 resulted in a strong interaction between YY1 and the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α (PGC1α), a major regulator of mitochondrial function. These results underscore the important role of YY1 in the maintenance of mitochondrial function and explain how its inactivation might contribute to exercise intolerance and mitochondrial myopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myofibrillar myopathies are a group of muscle disorders characterized by the disintegration of skeletal muscle fibers and formation of sarcomeric protein aggregates. All the proteins known to be involved in myofibrillar myopathies localize to a region of the sarcomere known as the Z-disk, the site at which defects are first observed. Given the common cellular phenotype observed in this group of disorders, it is thought that there is a common mechanism of pathology. Mutations in filamin C, which has several proposed roles in the development and function of skeletal muscle, can result in filamin-related myofibrillar myopathy. The lack of a suitable animal model system has limited investigation into the mechanism of pathology in this disease and the role of filamin C in muscle development. Here, we characterize stretched out (sot), a zebrafish filamin Cb mutant, together with targeted knockdown of zebrafish filamin Ca, revealing fiber dissolution and formation of protein aggregates strikingly similar to those seen in filamin-related myofibrillar myopathies. Through knockdown of both zebrafish filamin C homologues, we demonstrate that filamin C is not required for fiber specification and that fiber damage is a consequence of muscle activity. The remarkable similarities in the myopathology between our models and filamin-related myofibrillar myopathy makes them suitable for the study of these diseases and provides unique opportunities for the investigation of the function of filamin C in muscle and development of therapies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Paget's osteodystrophia deformans is a monoostotic or polyostotic disease of the skeletal system with increased bone remodelling, structural modifications and skeletal deformation, typically arranged like a chessboard. The unusual case of a patient is described who had suffered from generalized Paget's disease of the bone for 14 years and also developed progressive myopathy and a behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia. Further cytogenetic diagnostics revealed a point mutation in the valosin-containing protein (VCP, p97) gene on chromosome 9p13-p12 consistent with the finding of inclusion body myopathy with early onset Paget's disease and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD syndrome). A causal therapy of this disease is not known. Conservative treatment with bisphosphonate therapy, intensive physiotherapeutic exercise and psychotherapeutic treatment was performed to retard the progression of the disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the Valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene on chromosome 9p12-13. Patients demonstrate limb girdle muscle weakness, which eventually progresses to involve respiratory muscles, and death from respiratory and cardiac failure. This is the first investigation to analyze key molecular mediators and signaling cascades in skeletal muscle causing myopathy by global gene microarray in hopes of understanding the dysregulated genes and molecular mechanisms underlying IBMPFD and the hope of finding novel therapeutic targets. We determined expression profiles using Human Genome Array microarray technology in Vastus lateralis muscles from patients and their first-degree relatives. We analyzed gene annotations by Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integration Discovery and identified differentially dysregulated genes with roles in several novel biological pathways, including regulation of actin cytoskeleton, ErbB signaling, cancer, in addition to regulation of autophagy, and lysosomal signaling, known disrupted pathways in VCP disease. In this report, we present data from the first global microarray analyzing IBMPFD patient muscles and elucidating dysregulated pathways to further understand the pathogenesis of the disease and discover potential therapeutics.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Slow-channel syndrome (SCS) is an autosomal-dominant disease resulting from mutations in muscle acetylcholine (ACh) receptor subunits. The associated fatigue and muscle degeneration are proposed to result from prolonged synaptic responses that overload intracellular calcium. Single-channel studies on reconstituted receptors bearing human mutations indicate that the prolonged responses result from an increase in receptor open duration and, in some cases, increased sensitivity to ACh. We show that both of these aberrant receptor properties are recapitulated in heterozygotic zebrafish bearing an L258P mutation in the α subunit, thus affording the unique opportunity to compare the single-channel properties of mutant receptors to the synaptic currents in vivo. Whole-cell recordings revealed synaptic currents that decayed along a multiexponential time course, reflecting receptors containing mixtures of wild-type and mutant α subunits. Treatment with quinidine, an open-channel blocker used to treat the human disorder, restored fast synaptic current kinetics and the ability to swim. Quinidine block also revealed that mutant receptors generate a large steady-state current in the absence of ACh. The spontaneous openings reflected a destabilization of the closed state, leading to an apparent increase in the sensitivity of these receptors to ACh. The effective block by quinidine on synaptic currents as well as nonliganded openings points to dual sources for the calcium-dependent myopathy in certain forms of SCS.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the dysferlin gene are the cause of Limb-girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 2B and Miyoshi Myopathy. The dysferlin protein has been implicated in sarcolemmal resealing, leading to the idea that the pathophysiology of dysferlin deficiencies is due to a deficit in membrane repair. Here, we show using two different approaches that fulfilling membrane repair as asseyed by laser wounding assay is not sufficient for alleviating the dysferlin deficient pathology. First, we generated a transgenic mouse overexpressing myoferlin to test the hypothesis that myoferlin, which is homologous to dysferlin, can compensate for the absence of dysferlin. The myoferlin overexpressors show no skeletal muscle abnormalities, and crossing them with a dysferlin-deficient model rescues the membrane fusion defect present in dysferlin-deficient mice in vitro. However, myoferlin overexpression does not correct muscle histology in vivo. Second, we report that AAV-mediated transfer of a minidysferlin, previously shown to correct the membrane repair deficit in vitro, also fails to improve muscle histology. Furthermore, neither myoferlin nor the minidysferlin prevented myofiber degeneration following eccentric exercise. Our data suggest that the pathogenicity of dysferlin deficiency is not solely related to impairment in sarcolemmal repair and highlight the care needed in selecting assays to assess potential therapies for dysferlinopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Lymphotoxin beta (LTβ) regulates some inflammatory mechanisms that could be operative in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IM). We studied LTβ and LTβR in inflammatory myopathies, normal and disease controls with immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and in situ hybridisation. LTβ occurs in myonuclei of normal controls, implying its role in normal muscle physiology. LTβ is strongly upregulated in regenerating muscle fibres in all myopathies, but not in denervated myofibres. Normal-appearing myofibres in inflammatory myopathies and muscular dystrophies express LTβ possibly reflecting early myofibre damage, representing a hitherto undescribed pathologic hallmark. Furthermore, we visualised LTβ in several inflammatory cell types in inflammatory myopathies, suggesting its involvement in the different inflammatory mechanisms underlying inflammatory myopathy subgroups.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotubular myopathy (MTM) is a severe congenital muscle disease characterized by profound weakness, early respiratory failure and premature lethality. MTM is defined by muscle biopsy findings that include centralized nuclei and disorganization of perinuclear organelles. No treatments currently exist for MTM. We hypothesized that aberrant neuromuscular junction (NMJ) transmission is an important and potentially treatable aspect of the disease pathogenesis. We tested this hypothesis in two murine models of MTM. In both models we uncovered evidence of a disorder of NMJ transmission: fatigable weakness, improved strength with neostigmine, and electrodecrement with repetitive nerve stimulation. Histopathological analysis revealed abnormalities in the organization, appearance and size of individual NMJs, abnormalities that correlated with changes in acetylcholine receptor gene expression and subcellular localization. We additionally determined the ability of pyridostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, to ameliorate aspects of the behavioral phenotype related to NMJ dysfunction. Pyridostigmine treatment resulted in significant improvement in fatigable weakness and treadmill endurance. In all, these results describe a newly identified pathological abnormality in MTM, and uncover a potential disease-modifying therapy for this devastating disorder.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Missense mutations in dynamin 2 gene (DNM2) are associated with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (CNM) with characteristic histopathological findings of centrally located myonuclei in a large number of muscle fibers. METHODS: To identify Japanese CNM caused by DNM2 mutations (DNM2-CNM), we sequenced DNM2 in 22 unrelated Japanese patients who were pathologically diagnosed with CNM. The clinical and pathological findings of DNM2-CNM in patients were reviewed. RESULTS: We identified 3 different heterozygous missense mutations (p.E368K, p.R369W, and p.R465W) in 4 probands from 4 families. Clinically, calf muscle atrophy and pes cavus are features that are highly suggestive of DNM2-CNM among all CNMs. Pathologically, all 4 DNM2-CNM patients showed a radial distribution of myofibrils in scattered fibers, type 1 fiber atrophy, type 1 fiber predominance, and type 2C fibers. None of the non-DNM2-CNM patients exhibited all the 4 abovementioned pathological features, although some patients showed radial distribution without type 1 fiber atrophy and/or type 2C fibers. DISCUSSION: These results indicate that the clinicopathological features of DNM2-CNM are rather homogeneous and can be distinguished from the features of non-DNM2-CNM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Missense mutations that occur at the interface between two functional domains in the AAA protein p97 lead to suboptimal performance in its enzymatic activity and impaired intracellular functions, causing human disorders such as inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). Much progress has been made in characterizing these mutants at cellular, sub-cellular and molecular levels, gaining a substantial understanding of the involvement of p97 in various cellular pathways. At the tissue level, patient biopsies revealed co-localization of p97 with pathologic proteineous inclusions and rimmed vacuoles, which can be reproduced in various cellular and animal models of IBMPFD. At the subcellular level, alterations in p97's ability to bind various adaptor proteins have been demonstrated for some but not all binding partners. Biochemical and biophysical characterizations of pathogenic p97 revealed altered nucleotide binding properties in the D1-domains compared to the wild type. Structural studies showed that mutant p97 are capable of undergoing a uniform transition in the N-domain from a Down-to an Up-conformation in the presence of ATPγS, while in the wild-type p97, this conformational change can only be demonstrated in solutions but not in crystals. These structural and biochemical analyses of IBMPFD mutants shed new light into the mechanism of p97 function.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure and extensive myofibrillar lesions has been described in sporadic and familial cases and linked to various chromosomal regions. The mutated gene is unknown in most cases. We studied eight individuals, from three apparently unrelated families, with clinical and pathological features of hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure. The investigations included clinical examination, muscle histopathology and genetic analysis by whole exome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. All patients had adult onset muscle weakness in the pelvic girdle, neck flexors, respiratory and trunk muscles, and the majority had prominent calf hypertrophy. Examination of pulmonary function showed decreased vital capacity. No signs of cardiac muscle involvement were found. Muscle histopathological features included marked muscle fibre size variation, fibre splitting, numerous internal nuclei and fatty infiltration. Frequent groups of fibres showed eosinophilic inclusions and deposits. At the ultrastructural level, there were extensive myofibrillar lesions with marked Z-disc alterations. Whole exome sequencing in four individuals from one family revealed a missense mutation, g.274375T>C; p.Cys30071Arg, in the titin gene (TTN). The mutation, which changes a highly conserved residue in the myosin binding A-band titin, was demonstrated to segregate with the disease in all three families. High density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays covering the entire genome demonstrated sharing of a 6.99 Mb haplotype, located in chromosome region 2q31 including TTN, indicating common ancestry. Our results demonstrate a novel and the first disease-causing mutation in A-band titin associated with hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure. The typical histopathological features with prominent myofibrillar lesions and inclusions in muscle and respiratory failure early in the clinical course should be incentives for analysis of TTN mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In 2001, we described an autosomal dominant myopathy characterized by neuromuscular ventilatory failure in ambulant patients. Here we describe the underlying genetic basis for the disorder, and we define the neuromuscular, respiratory and radiological phenotype in a study of 31 mutation carriers followed for up to 31 years. A combination of genome-wide linkage and whole exome sequencing revealed the likely causal genetic variant in the titin (TTN) gene (g.274375T>C; p.Cys30071Arg) within a shared haplotype of 2.93 Mbp on chromosome 2. This segregated with the phenotype in 21 individuals from the original family, nine subjects in a second family with the same highly selective pattern of muscle involvement on magnetic resonance imaging and a third familial case with a similar phenotype. Comparing the mutation carriers revealed novel features not apparent in our original report. The clinical presentation included predominant distal, proximal or respiratory muscle weakness. The age of onset was highly variable, from early adulthood, and including a mild phenotype in advanced age. Muscle weakness was earlier onset and more severe in the lower extremities in nearly all patients. Seven patients also had axial muscle weakness. Respiratory function studies demonstrated a gradual deterioration over time, reflecting the progressive nature of this condition. Cardiomyopathy was not present in any of our patients despite up to 31 years of follow-up. Magnetic resonance muscle imaging was performed in 21 affected patients and revealed characteristic abnormalities with semitendinosus involvement in 20 of 21 patients studied, including 3 patients who were presymptomatic. Diagnostic muscle histopathology most frequently revealed eosinophilic inclusions (inclusion bodies) and rimmed vacuoles, but was non-specific in a minority of patients. These findings have important clinical implications. This disease should be considered in patients with adult-onset proximal or distal myopathy and early respiratory failure, even in the presence of non-specific muscle pathology. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging findings are characteristic and should be considered as an initial investigation, and if positive should prompt screening for mutations in TTN. With 363 exons, screening TTN presented a major challenge until recently. However, whole exome sequencing provides a reliable cost-effective approach, providing the gene of interest is adequately captured.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathy and myofibrillar myopathy are heterogeneous myopathies that both comprise early-onset forms. We present two sisters from a consanguineous Iraqi Kurdish family with predominant axial and limb girdle weakness. Muscle biopsies showed features of both nemaline myopathy and myofibrillar myopathy. We performed homozygosity mapping in both siblings using an Affymetrix 250K Nspl SNP array. One of the overlapping homozygous regions harbored the gene CFL2. Because a mutation in CFL2 was identified in a family with nemaline myopathy, we performed sequence analysis of the gene and a novel homozygous missense mutation in exon 2 (c.19G>A, p.Val7Met) of CFL2 was identified in both siblings. CFL2 encodes the protein cofilin-2, which plays an important role in regulation of sarcomeric actin filaments. To our knowledge, this is the second family in which a mutation in CFL2 causes an autosomal recessive form of congenital myopathy with features of both nemaline and myofibrillar myopathy. Given the clinical variability and the multitude of histological features of congenital myopathies, CFL2 sequence analysis should be considered in patients presenting with an autosomal recessive form of congenital myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Oxidation of lipid substrates is essential for survival in fasting and other catabolic conditions, sparing glucose for the brain and other glucose-dependent tissues. Here we show Steroid Receptor Coactivator-3 (SRC-3) plays a central role in long chain fatty acid metabolism by directly regulating carnitine/acyl-carnitine translocase (CACT) gene expression. Genetic deficiency of CACT in humans is accompanied by a constellation of metabolic and toxicity phenotypes including hypoketonemia, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and impaired neurologic, cardiac and skeletal muscle performance, each of which is apparent in mice lacking SRC-3 expression. Consistent with human cases of CACT deficiency, dietary rescue with short chain fatty acids drastically attenuates the clinical hallmarks of the disease in mice devoid of SRC-3. Collectively, our results position SRC-3 as a key regulator of β-oxidation. Moreover, these findings allow us to consider platform coactivators such as the SRCs as potential contributors to syndromes such as CACT deficiency, previously considered as monogenic.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>INTRODUCTION: Autoantibodies in patients with polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM) are associated with unique subsets, clinical course and outcome. Anti-MJ antibodies, which recognize the nuclear protein NXP-2/MORC3, are reported in ~25% of juvenile DM. Prevalence and clinical significance of anti-MJ antibodies in adult Italian PM/DM patients were studied. METHODS: Sera from 58 consecutive adult Italian PM/DM patients were analyzed by immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled K562 cells extract, ELISA (anti-MJ, Jo-1), Western blot and indirect immunofluorescence. Clinical associations were analyzed using information from medical charts. RESULTS: Anti-MJ antibodies were the most prevalent specificity (17%) found mainly in DM (30%, 8 cases) vs 8% of PM (2 cases, P = 0.02). Comparing 10 anti-MJ (+) vs 48 anti-MJ (-) cases, DM was more common (P = 0.03), and age at onset was younger in anti-MJ (+) (P = 0.0006). In anti-MJ (+), heliotrope rash (P = 0.01) and calcinosis (P = 0.09) were more frequent. None of them had heart or lung involvement, or malignancy. Myopathy in anti-MJ (+) patients responded well to therapy and none of them had elevated CPK at last visit (0% vs 25% in anti-MJ (-)). Only 60% of anti-MJ (+) showed immunofluorescent nuclear dots staining, despite PML localization of NXP-2/MORC3. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-MJ antibodies are the most frequent specificity in our cohort of adult Italian PM/DM. Anti-MJ (+) were associated with young onset DM, calcinosis, no internal organ involvement and good response of myopathy to therapy. Anti-MJ reported in juvenile DM is also found in adult PM/DM, and could be a new useful biomarker.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Autosomal dominant mutations in BTB and Kelch domain containing 13 protein (KBTBD13) are associated with a new type of Nemaline Myopathy (NEM). NEM is a genetically heterogeneous group of muscle disorders. Mutations causing phenotypically distinct NEM variants have previously been identified in components of muscle thin filament. KBTBD13 is a muscle specific protein composed of an N terminal BTB domain and a C terminal Kelch-repeat domain. The function of this newly identified protein in muscle remained unknown. In this study, we show that KBTBD13 interacts with Cullin 3 (Cul3) and the BTB domain mediates this interaction. Using ubiquitination assays, we determined that KBTBD13 participates in the formation of a Cul3 based RING ubiquitin ligase (Cul3-RL) capable of ubiquitin conjugation. Confocal microscopy of transiently expressed KBTBD13 revealed its co-localization with ubiquitin. Taken together, our results demonstrate that KBTBD13 is a putative substrate adaptor for Cul3-RL that functions as a muscle specific ubiquitin ligase, and thereby implicate the ubiquitin proteasome pathway in the pathogenesis of KBTBD13-associated NEM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Danon disease is caused by mutations of the lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP2) gene at Xq24. Male patients usually manifested as severe cardiomyopathy, mild myopathy and mental retardation. We describe two patients: the first patient presented with severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, proximal muscle weakness, and chronic painless diarrhea; the second patient manifested as limb-girdle muscle weakness, mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, sub-clinical neuropathy. Muscle biopsies indicated autophagic vacuolar myopathy. Immunologic analysis demonstrated absence of the LAMP2 protein in the first patient, while a smear of expression was detected in the second patient. Two nonsense mutations (p.E298X and p. K402X) were identified in the two cases, respectively located in exon 7 and exon 9B of the LAMP2 gene. Our findings indicated that patients with Danon disease caused by mutations in exon 1 – 8 manifested as a typically severe phenotype, while patients with mutations in exon 9 of the LAMP2B isoform presented with a relatively benign phenotype.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Causes of autosomal-recessive intellectual disability (ID) have, until very recently, been under researched because of the high degree of genetic heterogeneity. However, now that genome-wide approaches can be applied to single multiplex consanguineous families, the identification of genes harboring disease-causing mutations by autozygosity mapping is expanding rapidly. Here, we have mapped a disease locus in a consanguineous Pakistani family affected by ID and distal myopathy. We genotyped family members on genome-wide SNP microarrays and used the data to determine a single 2.5 Mb homozygosity-by-descent (HBD) locus in region 5p15.32-p15.31; we identified the missense change c.2035G>A (p.Gly679Arg) at a conserved residue within NSUN2. This gene encodes a methyltransferase that catalyzes formation of 5-methylcytosine at C34 of tRNA-leu(CAA) and plays a role in spindle assembly during mitosis as well as chromosome segregation. In mouse brains, we show that NSUN2 localizes to the nucleolus of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. The effects of the mutation were confirmed by the transfection of wild-type and mutant constructs into cells and subsequent immunohistochemistry. We show that mutation to arginine at this residue causes NSUN2 to fail to localize within the nucleolus. The ID combined with a unique profile of comorbid features presented here makes this an important genetic discovery, and the involvement of NSUN2 highlights the role of RNA methyltransferase in human neurocognitive development.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the four-and-a-half LIM domains 1 gene (fhl1) are associated with various phenotypes of hereditary myopathies, including reducing body myopathy. We describe here a mother, daughter and son suffering from FHL1 myopathy with a mutation in the second LIM domain of fhl1. We investigated whether there is a characteristic muscle involvement in both sexes. Despite the variety of symptoms exhibited by the male and female patients, the systemic imaging studies showed a similar pattern: the flexor muscles of the brachium and thigh were affected earlier than the extensor muscle with a profound degeneration of the paraspinal muscles. These findings may include one of the characteristic clinical features for suspecting a mutation in the second LIM domain.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles/hereditary inclusion body myopathy is clinically characterized by the early involvement of distal leg muscles. The striking pathological features of the myopathy are muscle fibers with rimmed vacuoles. To date, the role of aquaporin-4 water channel in distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles/hereditary inclusion body myopathy has not been studied. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we studied the expression of aquaporin-4 in muscle fibers of a patient with distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles/hereditary inclusion body myopathy. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses showed that sarcolemmal aquaporin-4 immunoreactivity was reduced in many muscle fibers of the patient. However, the intensity of aquaporin-4 staining was markedly increased at rimmed vacuoles or its surrounding areas and in some muscle fibers. The fast-twitch type 2 fibers were predominantly involved with the strong aquaporin-4-positive rimmed vacuoles and TAR-DNA-binding protein-43 aggregations. Rimmed vacuoles with strong aquaporin-4 expression seen in the distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles/hereditary inclusion body myopathy patient were not found in control muscles without evidence of neuromuscular disorders and the other disease-controls. CONCLUSIONS: Aquaporin-4 might be crucial in determining the survival or degeneration of fast-twitch type 2 fibers in distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles/hereditary inclusion body myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Facioscapulohumeral Disease (FSHD) is a dominantly inherited progressive myopathy associated with aberrant production of the transcription factor, Double Homeobox Protein 4 (DUX4). The expression of DUX4 depends on an open chromatin conformation of the D4Z4 macrosatellite array and a specific haplotype on chromosome 4. Even when these requirements are met, DUX4 transcripts and protein are only detectable in a subset of cells indicating that additional constraints govern DUX4 production. Since the direction of transcription, along with the production of non-coding antisense transcripts is an important regulatory feature of other macrosatellite repeats, we developed constructs that contain the non-coding region of a single D4Z4 unit flanked by genes that report transcriptional activity in the sense and antisense directions. We found that D4Z4 contains two promoters that initiate sense and antisense transcription within the array, and that antisense transcription predominates. Transcriptional start sites for the antisense transcripts, as well as D4Z4 regions that regulate the balance of sense and antisense transcripts were identified. We show that the choice of transcriptional direction is reversible but not mutually exclusive, since sense and antisense reporter activity was often present in the same cell and simultaneously upregulated during myotube formation. Similarly, levels of endogenous sense and antisense D4Z4 transcripts were upregulated in FSHD myotubes. These studies offer insight into the autonomous distribution of muscle weakness that is characteristic of FSHD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Laing distal myopathy is an autosomal dominant disease due to mutations in the gene encoding for the human slow-β myosin heavy chain, MYH7. Most reports describe it as a mild, early onset myopathy with involvement usually restricted to foot extensors, hand finger extensors and neck flexors, and unspecific findings on muscle biopsy. We identified the first two Italian families with Laing distal myopathy, harboring two novel mutations in the MYH7 gene and performed clinical, neurophysiological, pathological, muscle MRI and cardiological investigations on affected members from the two families. Subjects from one family presented a moderate-severe phenotype, with proximal together with distal involvement and even loss of ambulation at advanced age. One patient displayed atypical muscle biopsy findings including cytoplasmic bodies and myofibrillar myopathy-like features. Affected members from the second family shared a very mild phenotype, with weakness largely limited to long toe and foot extensors and/or late onset. No patient showed any sign of heart involvement. Our study significantly broadens the clinical and pathological spectrum of Laing distal myopathy. We suggest that MYH7 screening should be considered in undiagnosed late-onset distal myopathy or cytoplasmic body myopathy patients.</rdfs:comment>

A 120 kD protein recognized by certain patients with DM was identified and clinical features of patients with this specificity were characterized. METHODS: The 120 kD protein recognized by a prototype serum was purified and identified by mass spectrometry and immunological methods. Autoantibody to this 120 kD protein was screened in sera from 2,356 patients with various diagnoses from four countries, including 254 PM/DM, by immunoprecipitation of 35S-methionine labeled K562 cell extracts. Clinical information of patients with this specificity was collected. RESULTS: The 120 kD protein, which exactly comigrated with PL-12, was identified as transcription intermediary factor TIF1β (TRIM28) by mass spectrometry and validated by immunoassays. By immunofluorescence, anti-TIF1β positivity showed a fine-speckled nuclear staining pattern. Four cases of anti-TIF1β were identified; all are women, one each in a Japanese, African American, Caucasian, and Mexican individual. Three had a diagnosis of DM and one case was classified as having an undifferentiated connective tissue disease with an elevated CPK but without significant muscle symptoms. This individual also had a history of colon cancer, cervical squamous metaplasia and fibroid tumors of the uterus. Myopathy was mild in all cases and resolved without treatment in one case. The anti-TIF1β specificity was not found in other conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-TIF1β is a new DM autoantibody associated with a mild form of myopathy. Whether it has an association with malignancy, as in the case of anti-TIF1γ, or other unique features will need to be evaluated in future studies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Glucosamine (UDP-N-acetyl)-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) myopathy, also called distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV) or hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM), is a rare, progressive autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the GNE gene. Here, we examined the relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype in participants with GNE myopathy. METHODS: Participants with GNE myopathy were asked to complete a questionnaire regarding medical history and current symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 71 participants with genetically confirmed GNE myopathy (27 males and 44 females; mean age, 43.1±13.0 (mean±SD) years) completed the questionnaire. Initial symptoms (e.g., foot drop and lower limb weakness) appeared at a mean age of 24.8±8.3 years. Among the 71 participants, 11 (15.5%) had the ability to walk, with a median time to loss of ambulation of 17.0±2.1 years after disease onset. Participants with a homozygous mutation (p.V572L) in the N-acetylmannosamine kinase domain (KD/KD participants) had an earlier disease onset compared to compound heterozygous participants with mutations in the uridine diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) 2-epimerase and N-acetylmannosamine kinase domains (ED/KD participants; 26.3±7.3 vs. 21.2±11.1 years, respectively). KD/KD participants were more frequently non-ambulatory compared to ED/KD participants at the time of survey (80% vs. 50%). Data were verified using medical records available from 17 outpatient participants. CONCLUSIONS: Homozygous KD/KD participants exhibited a more severe phenotype compared to heterozygous ED/KD participants.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif-containing 32 (TRIM32) are responsible for the disease limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2H (LGMD2H). Previously, we generated Trim32 knockout mice (Trim32-/-mice) and showed that they display a myopathic phenotype accompanied by neurogenic features. Here, we used these mice to investigate the muscle-specific defects arising from the absence of TRIM32, which underlie the myopathic phenotype. Using 2 models of induced atrophy, we showed that TRIM32 is dispensable for muscle atrophy. Conversely, TRIM32 was necessary for muscle regrowth after atrophy. Furthermore, TRIM32-deficient primary myoblasts underwent premature senescence and impaired myogenesis due to accumulation of PIAS4, an E3 SUMO ligase and TRIM32 substrate that was previously shown to be associated with senescence. Premature senescence of myoblasts was also observed in vivo in an atrophy/regrowth model. Trim32-/-muscles had substantially fewer activated satellite cells, increased PIAS4 levels, and growth failure compared with wild-type muscles. Moreover, Trim32-/-muscles exhibited features of premature sarcopenia, such as selective type II fast fiber atrophy. These results imply that premature senescence of muscle satellite cells is an underlying pathogenic feature of LGMD2H and reveal what we believe to be a new mechanism of muscular dystrophy associated with reductions in available satellite cells and premature sarcopenia.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are associated with a strikingly broad range of clinical phenotypes, the molecular basis for which remains obscure. Here, we report a novel missense mutation (c.137G>A, p.Gly46Asp) in the catalytic domain of YARS2, which codes for the mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, in a subject with myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA). YARS2 was undetectable by immunoblot analysis in subject myoblasts, resulting in a generalized mitochondrial translation defect. Retroviral expression of a wild-type YARS2 complementary DNA completely rescued the translation defect. We previously demonstrated that the respiratory chain defect in this subject was only present in fully differentiated muscle, and we show here that this likely reflects an increased requirement for YARS2 as muscle cells differentiate. An additional, heterozygous mutation was detected in TRMU/MTU1, a gene encoding the mitochondrial 2-thiouridylase. Although subject myoblasts and myotubes contained half the normal levels of TRMU, thiolation of mitochondrial tRNAs was normal. YARS2 eluted as part of high-molecular-weight complexes of ∼250 kDa and 1 MDa by gel filtration. This study confirms mutations in YARS2 as a cause of MLASA and shows that, like some of the cytoplasmic ARSs, mitochondrial ARSs occur in high-molecular-weight complexes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hereditary myosin myopathies are characterized by variable clinical features. Inclusion body myopathy 3 (IBM-3) is an autosomal dominant disease associated with a missense mutation (E706K) in the myosin heavy chain IIa gene. Adult patients experience progressive muscle weakness. Biopsies reveal dystrophic changes, rimmed vacuoles with cytoplasmic inclusions, and focal disorganization of myofilaments. We constructed a transgene encoding E706K myosin and expressed it in Drosophila (E701K) indirect flight and jump muscles to establish a novel homozygous organism with homogeneous populations of fast IBM-3 myosin and muscle fibers. Flight and jump abilities were severely reduced in homozygotes. ATPase and actin sliding velocity of the mutant myosin were depressed >80% compared with wild-type myosin. Light scattering experiments and electron microscopy revealed that mutant myosin heads bear a dramatic propensity to collapse and aggregate. Thus E706K (E701K) myosin appears far more labile than wild-type myosin. Furthermore, mutant fly fibers exhibit ultrastructural hallmarks seen in patients, including cytoplasmic inclusions containing aberrant proteinaceous structures and disorganized muscle filaments. Our Drosophila model reveals the unambiguous consequences of the IBM-3 lesion on fast muscle myosin and fibers. The abnormalities observed in myosin function and muscle ultrastructure likely contribute to muscle weakness observed in our flies and patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVES: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a degenerative muscle wasting disease caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Dystrophic muscle is characterized by chronic inflammation, and inflammatory mediators could be promising targets for innovative therapeutic interventions. We analyzed muscle biopsy samples of DMD-affected children to characterize interleukin (IL)-17 and Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) expression levels and to identify possible correlations with clinical status. METHODS: Expression levels of IL-17, Foxp3, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), IL-6, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) were analyzed by real-time PCR in muscle biopsy samples from patients with DMD (n = 27) and juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) (n = 8). Motor outcome of patients with DMD was evaluated by North Star Ambulatory Assessment score. RESULTS: In DMD, we found higher levels of IL-17 and lower levels of Foxp3 mRNA compared with those for a typical inflammatory myopathy, JDM. Moreover, the IL-17/Foxp3 ratio was higher in DMD than in JDM biopsy samples. IL-17 mRNA levels appeared to be related to the expression levels of other proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and MCP-1) and significantly associated with clinical outcome of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The association of IL-17 expression with levels of other inflammatory cytokines and with the clinical course of DMD suggests a possible pathogenic role of IL-17.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)) deficiency has been associated with 5 major clinical phenotypes: encephalomyopathy, severe infantile multisystemic disease, nephropathy, cerebellar ataxia, and isolated myopathy. Primary CoQ(10) deficiency is due to defects in CoQ(10) biosynthesis, while secondary forms are due to other causes. A review of 149 cases, including our cohort of 76 patients, confirms that CoQ(10) deficiency is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome that mainly begins in childhood and predominantly manifests as cerebellar ataxia. Coenzyme Q(10) measurement in muscle is the gold standard for diagnosis. Identification of CoQ(10) deficiency is important because the condition frequently responds to treatment. Causative mutations have been identified in a small proportion of patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>IBMPFD, Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia, is a hereditary degenerative disorder due to single missense mutations in VCP (Valosin-Containing Protein). The mechanisms of how mutations of VCP lead to IBMPFD remain mysterious. Here we utilize two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) combined with mass spectrometry to study the IBMPFD disorder at the protein level. With this set-up, we are able to employ comparative proteomics to analyze IBMPFD disease using Drosophila melanogaster as our disease model organism. Head proteome of transgenic D. melanogaster expressing wild type VCP is compared, respectively, with the head proteome of transgenic mutant type VCPs that correspond to human IBMPFD disease alleles (TER94(A229E), TER94(R188Q), and TER94(R152H)). Of all the proteins identified, a significant fraction of proteins altered in TER94(A229E) and TER94(R188Q) mutants belong to the same functional categories, i.e. apoptosis and metabolism. Among these, Drosophila transferrin is observed to be significantly up-regulated in mutant flies expressing TER94(A229E). A knock-down experiment suggests that fly transferrin might be a potential modifier in IBMPFD disease. The molecular analysis of IBMPFD disease may benefit from the proteomics approach which combines the advantages of high throughput analysis and the focus on protein levels.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The calpains are physiologically important Ca(2+)-activated regulatory proteases, which are divided into typical or atypical sub-families based on constituent domains. Both sub-families are present in mammals, but our understanding of calpain function is based primarily on typical sub-family members. Here, we take advantage of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, which expresses only atypical calpains, to extend our knowledge of the phylogenetic evolution and function of calpains. We provide evidence that a typical human calpain protein with a penta EF hand, detected using custom profile hidden Markov models, is conserved in ancient metazoans and a divergent clade. These analyses also provide evidence for the lineage-specific loss of typical calpain genes in C. elegans and Ciona, and they reveal that many calpain-like genes lack an intact catalytic triad. Given the association between the dysregulation of typical calpains and human degenerative pathologies, we explored the phenotypes, expression profiles, and consequences of inappropriate reduction or activation of C. elegans atypical calpains. These studies show that the atypical calpain gene, clp-1, contributes to muscle degeneration and reveal that clp-1 activity is sensitive to genetic manipulation of [Ca(2+)](i). We show that CLP-1 localizes to sarcomeric sub-structures, but is excluded from dense bodies (Z-disks). We find that the muscle degeneration observed in a C. elegans model of dystrophin-based muscular dystrophy can be suppressed by clp-1 inactivation and that nemadipine-A inhibition of the EGL-19 calcium channel reveals that Ca(2+) dysfunction underlies the C. elegans MyoD model of myopathy. Taken together, our analyses highlight the roles of calcium dysregulation and CLP-1 in muscle myopathies and suggest that the atypical calpains could retain conserved roles in myofilament turnover.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Familial dilated cardiomyopathy is a major cause of advanced heart failure and heart transplantation. In most families, the disease-causing mutation is unknown, and relatives should therefore undergo periodic screening to facilitate early diagnosis and therapy. In the present study, we describe a novel titin truncation mutation causing adult-onset familial dilated cardiomyopathy in an Israeli Arab family. The family members underwent physical examination, electrocardiography, and Doppler echocardiography. Linkage to candidate loci was performed, followed by gene sequencing. We identified 13 clinically affected family members (8 men and 5 women, mean age 47 ± 12 years). Compared with their healthy first-degree relatives, the affected relatives had a larger end-diastolic left ventricular dimension (60 ± 10 vs 49 ± 4 mm, p &lt;0.001), lower ejection fraction (43 ± 11% vs 60 ± 6%, p &lt;0.001), and markedly higher end-systolic volume indexes but no difference in wall thickness or diastolic function. The linkage studies or direct sequencing excluded LMNA, MYH7, TNNT2, TNNI3, SCN5A, DES, SGCD, ACTC, PLN, and MYH6 but established linkage to the TTN locus at chromosome 2q31, yielding a maximum (2-point) LOD score of 3.44. Sequence analysis identified an insertion (c.58880insA), causing protein truncation after 19,628 amino acids (p.S19628IfsX1). No founder effect was found among the Israeli Arabs. In conclusion, titin is a giant protein with a key role in sarcomere assembly, force transmission, and maintenance of resting tension. Although some mutations result in skeletal myopathy, others cause isolated, maturity-onset cardiomyopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Diaphyseal medullary stenosis with malignant fibrous histiocytoma (DMS-MFH) is an autosomal-dominant syndrome characterized by bone dysplasia, myopathy, and bone cancer. We previously mapped the DMS-MFH tumor-suppressing-gene locus to chromosomal region 9p21-22 but failed to identify mutations in known genes in this region. We now demonstrate that DMS-MFH results from mutations in the most proximal of three previously uncharacterized terminal exons of the gene encoding methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, MTAP. Intriguingly, two of these MTAP exons arose from early and independent retroviral-integration events in primate genomes at least 40 million years ago, and since then, their genomic integration has gained a functional role. MTAP is a ubiquitously expressed homotrimeric-subunit enzyme critical to polyamine metabolism and adenine and methionine salvage pathways and was believed to be encoded as a single transcript from the eight previously described exons. Six distinct retroviral-sequence-containing MTAP isoforms, each of which can physically interact with archetype MTAP, have been identified. The disease-causing mutations occur within one of these retroviral-derived exons and result in exon skipping and dysregulated alternative splicing of all MTAP isoforms. Our results identify a gene involved in the development of bone sarcoma, provide evidence of the primate-specific evolution of certain parts of an existing gene, and demonstrate that mutations in parts of this gene can result in human disease despite its relatively recent origin.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hereditary muscle-type phosphofructokinase (PFK) deficiency causing intermittent hemolytic anemia and exertional myopathy due to a single nonsense mutation in PFKM has been previously described in English Springer and American Cocker Spaniels, Whippets, and mixed breed dogs. We report here on a new missense mutation associated with PFK deficiency in Wachtelhunds. Coding regions of the PFKM gene were amplified from genomic DNA and/or cDNA reverse-transcribed from RNA of EDTA blood of PFK-deficient and clinically healthy Wachtelhunds and control dogs. The amplicons were sequenced and compared to the published canine PFKM sequence. A point mutation (c.550C>T, in the coding sequence of PFKM expressed in blood) was found in all 4 affected Wachtelhunds. This missense mutation results in an amino acid substitution of arginine (Arg) to tryptophan (Trp) at position 184 of the protein expressed in blood (p.Arg184Trp). The mutation is located within an alpha-helix, and based on the SIFT analysis, this amino acid substitution is not tolerated. Amplifying the region around this mutation and digesting the PCR fragment with the restriction enzyme MspI, produces fragments that readily differentiate between PFK-deficient, carrier, and normal animals. Furthermore, we document 2 additional upstream PFKM exons expressed in canine testis but not in blood. Despite their similar phenotypic appearance and use for hunting, Wachtelhunds and English Springer Spaniels are not thought to have common ancestors. Thus, it is not surprising that different mutations are responsible for PFK deficiency in these breeds. Knowledge of the molecular basis of PFK deficiency in Wachtelhunds provides an opportunity to screen and control the spread of this deleterious trait.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Muscle cells have a remarkable capability to repair plasma membrane lesions. Mutations in dysferlin (dysf) are known to elicit a progressive myopathy in humans, probably due to impaired sarcolemmal repair. We show here that loss of Dysf and annexin A6 (Anxa6) function lead to myopathy in zebrafish. By use of high-resolution imaging of myofibers in intact animals, we reveal sequential phases in sarcolemmal repair. Initially, membrane vesicles enriched in Dysf together with cytoplasmic Anxa6 form a tight patch at the lesion independently of one another. In the subsequent steps, annexin A2a (Anxa2a) followed by annexin A1a (Anxa1a) accumulate at the patch; the recruitment of these annexins depends on Dysf and Anxa6. Thus, sarcolemmal repair relies on the ordered assembly of a protein-membrane scaffold. Moreover, we provide several lines of evidence that the membrane for sarcolemmal repair is derived from a specialized plasma membrane compartment.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor is an essential component of the excitation-contraction coupling apparatus. Mutations in RYR1 are associated with several congenital myopathies (termed RYR1-related myopathies) that are the most common non-dystrophic muscle diseases of childhood. Currently, no treatments exist for these disorders. Although the primary pathogenic abnormality involves defective excitation-contraction coupling, other abnormalities likely play a role in disease pathogenesis. In an effort to discover novel pathogenic mechanisms, we analysed two complementary models of RYR1-related myopathies, the relatively relaxed zebrafish and cultured myotubes from patients with RYR1-related myopathies. Expression array analysis in the zebrafish disclosed significant abnormalities in pathways associated with cellular stress. Subsequent studies focused on oxidative stress in relatively relaxed zebrafish and RYR1-related myopathy myotubes and demonstrated increased oxidant activity, the presence of oxidative stress markers, excessive production of oxidants by mitochondria and diminished survival under oxidant conditions. Exposure to the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine reduced oxidative stress and improved survival in the RYR1-related myopathies human myotubes ex vivo and led to significant restoration of aspects of muscle function in the relatively relaxed zebrafish, thereby confirming its efficacy in vivo. We conclude that oxidative stress is an important pathophysiological mechanism in RYR1-related myopathies and that N-acetylcysteine is a successful treatment modality ex vivo and in a vertebrate disease model. We propose that N-acetylcysteine represents the first potential therapeutic strategy for these debilitating muscle diseases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myosin binding protein-C (MyBP-C), a major thick filament associated sarcomeric protein, plays an important functional and structural role in regulating sarcomere assembly and crossbridge formation. Missing or aberrant MyBP-C proteins (both cardiac and skeletal) have been shown to cause both cardiac and skeletal myopathies, thereby emphasising its importance for the normal functioning of the sarcomere. Mutations in cardiac MyBP-C are a major cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), while mutations in skeletal MyBP-C have been implicated in a disease of skeletal muscle-distal arthrogryposis type 1 (DA-1). Here we report the first detailed electron microscopy studies on human cardiac and skeletal tissues carrying MyBP-C gene mutations, using samples obtained from HCM and DA-1 patients. We have used established image averaging methods to identify and study the axial distribution of MyBP-C on the thick filament by averaging profile plots of the A-band of the sarcomere from electron micrographs of human cardiac and skeletal myopathy specimens. Due to the difficulty of obtaining normal human tissue, we compared the distribution to the A-band structure in normal frog skeletal, rat cardiac muscle and in cardiac muscle of MyBP-C-deficient mice. Very similar overall profile averages were obtained from the C-zones in cardiac HCM samples and skeletal DA-1 samples with MyBP-C gene mutations, suggesting that mutations in MyBP-C do not alter its mean axial distribution along the thick filament.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Description of 8 new ANO5 mutations and significant expansion of the clinical phenotype spectrum associated with previously known and unknown mutations to improve diagnostic accuracy. METHODS: DNA samples of 101 patients in 95 kindreds at our quaternary referral center in Finland, who had undetermined limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), calf distal myopathy, or creatine kinase (CK) elevations of more than 2,000 IU/L, were selected for ANO5 genetic evaluation, and the clinical findings of patients with mutations were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients with muscular dystrophy caused by 11 different recessive mutations in the ANO5 gene were identified. The vast majority of mutations, 8 of 11, proved to be previously unknown new mutations. The most frequent mutation, c.2272C>T (p.R758C), was present in 20 patients. The phenotypes associated with this and the common European mutation, c.191dupA, varied from nearly asymptomatic high hyperCKemia to severe LGMD with consistently milder phenotypes in female patients. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in ANO5 are a frequent cause of undetermined muscular dystrophy, with both distal and proximal presentation. Other types include high hyperCKemia, myalgia, or calf hypertrophy over decades without significant weakness, especially in female patients. Mutations are distributed all over the gene, indicating that muscular dystrophy caused by ANO5 can be expected to occur in all populations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Centronuclear myopathy (CNM) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder associated with general skeletal muscle weakness, type I fiber predominance and atrophy, and abnormally centralized nuclei. Autosomal dominant CNM is due to mutations in the large GTPase dynamin 2 (DNM2), a mechanochemical enzyme regulating cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking in cells. To date, 40 families with CNM-related DNM2 mutations have been described, and here we report 60 additional families encompassing a broad genotypic and phenotypic spectrum. In total, 18 different mutations are reported in 100 families and our cohort harbors nine known and four new mutations, including the first splice-site mutation. Genotype-phenotype correlation hypotheses are drawn from the published and new data, and allow an efficient screening strategy for molecular diagnosis. In addition to CNM, dissimilar DNM2 mutations are associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) peripheral neuropathy (CMTD1B and CMT2M), suggesting a tissue-specific impact of the mutations. In this study, we discuss the possible clinical overlap of CNM and CMT, and the biological significance of the respective mutations based on the known functions of dynamin 2 and its protein structure. Defects in membrane trafficking due to DNM2 mutations potentially represent a common pathological mechanism in CNM and CMT.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Using exome sequencing we searched for the genetic cause of autosomal dominant myofibrillar myopathy with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) in a Swedish family. A heterozygous C-to-T transition, c.1255C>T, p.Pro419Ser in the desmin gene on chromosome 2q35, was identified. Previous studies had demonstrated linkage to chromosome 10q22.3, but no causative mutation had been found in that region. Sanger sequencing of DNA from 17 family members confirmed the heterozygous c.1255C>T desmin mutation in seven out of ten family members that had been classified as affected in the previous study. Our new results demonstrate the usefulness of next-generation sequencing, and the diagnostic difficulties with some forms of dominantly inherited muscle diseases as they can display a wide clinical and morphological variability even within a given family.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We ascertained a nuclear family in which three of four siblings were affected with an unclassified autosomal recessive myopathy characterized by severe weakness, respiratory impairment, scoliosis, joint contractures, and an unusual combination of dystrophic and myopathic features on muscle biopsy. Whole genome sequence from one affected subject was filtered using linkage data and variant databases. A single gene, MEGF10, contained nonsynonymous mutations that co-segregated with the phenotype. Affected subjects were compound heterozygous for missense mutations c.976T > C (p.C326R) and c.2320T > C (p.C774R). Screening the MEGF10 open reading frame in 190 patients with genetically unexplained myopathies revealed a heterozygous mutation, c.211C > T (p.R71W), in one additional subject with a similar clinical and histological presentation as the discovery family. All three mutations were absent from at least 645 genotyped unaffected control subjects. MEGF10 contains 17 atypical epidermal growth factor-like domains, each of which contains eight cysteine residues that likely form disulfide bonds. Both the p.C326R and p.C774R mutations alter one of these residues, which are completely conserved in vertebrates. Previous work showed that murine Megf10 is required for preserving the undifferentiated, proliferative potential of satellite cells, myogenic precursors that regenerate skeletal muscle in response to injury or disease. Here, knockdown of megf10 in zebrafish by four different morpholinos resulted in abnormal phenotypes including unhatched eggs, curved tails, impaired motility, and disorganized muscle tissue, corroborating the pathogenicity of the human mutations. Our data establish the importance of MEGF10 in human skeletal muscle and suggest satellite cell dysfunction as a novel myopathic mechanism.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dynamin 2 (Dnm2) is involved in endocytosis and intracellular membrane trafficking through its function in vesicle formation from distinct membrane compartments. Heterozygous (HTZ) mutations in the DNM2 gene cause dominant centronuclear myopathy or Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. We generated a knock-in Dnm2R465W mouse model expressing the most frequent human mutation and recently reported that HTZ mice progressively developed a myopathy. We investigated here the cause of neonatal lethality occurring in homozygous (HMZ) mice. We show that HMZ mice present at birth with a reduced body weight, hypoglycemia, increased liver glycogen content and hepatomegaly, in agreement with a defect in neonatal autophagy. In vitro studies performed in HMZ embryonic fibroblasts point out to a decrease in the autophagy flux prior to degradation at the autolysosome. We show that starved HMZ cells have a higher number of immature autophagy-related structures probably due to a defect of acidification. Our results highlight the role of Dnm2 in the cross talk between endosomal and autophagic pathways and evidence a new role of Dnm2-dependent membrane trafficking in autophagy which may be relevant in DNM2-related human diseases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To increase awareness to the possibility of nemaline myopathy (NM) when abnormal prenatal ultrasound findings appear together with a carrier state for the common exon 55 deletion in the nebulin gene (NEB) of an Ashkenazi Jewish parent. METHODS: We describe four unrelated pregnancies with abnormal prenatal ultrasound findings resulting in the birth of newborns with NM, where one or both parents were of Ashkenazi Jewish origin. Data was collected retrospectively from the patients' medical files. Molecular analysis of NEB was performed on the DNA from the patients and parents. RESULTS: Prenatal ultrasound findings included polyhydramnios, decreased fetal movements, club feet, and arthrogryposis. A biopsy from two of the newborns was consistent with NM. In all of the newborns, the common NEB exon 55 deletion was detected in the heterozygote state and in three of them, a second novel mutation was found. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasonographic findings suggestive of a myopathy and a carrier state for the NEB exon 55 deletion in one of the parents should trigger a thorough investigation for NM. The extreme size of NEB imposes great difficulties when searching for a second mutation, especially under the time constraints of an ongoing pregnancy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1D (LGMD1D) was linked to chromosome 7q36 over a decade ago, but its genetic cause has remained elusive. Here we studied nine LGMD-affected families from Finland, the United States and Italy and identified four dominant missense mutations leading to p.Phe93Leu or p.Phe89Ile changes in the ubiquitously expressed co-chaperone DNAJB6. Functional testing in vivo showed that the mutations have a dominant toxic effect mediated specifically by the cytoplasmic isoform of DNAJB6. In vitro studies demonstrated that the mutations increase the half-life of DNAJB6, extending this effect to the wild-type protein, and reduce its protective anti-aggregation effect. Further, we show that DNAJB6 interacts with members of the CASA complex, including the myofibrillar myopathy-causing protein BAG3. Our data identify the genetic cause of LGMD1D, suggest that its pathogenesis is mediated by defective chaperone function and highlight how mutations in a ubiquitously expressed gene can exert effects in a tissue-, isoform- and cellular compartment-specific manner.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Age-associated decline in antioxidant potential and accumulation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species are primary causes for multiple health problems, including muscular dystrophy and sarcopenia. The role of the nuclear erythroid-2-p45-related factor-2 (Nrf2) signaling has been implicated in antioxidant gene regulation. Here, we investigated the loss-of-function mechanisms for age-dependent regulation of Nrf2/ARE (Antioxidant Response Element) signaling in skeletal muscle (SM). Under basal physiological conditions, disruption of Nrf2 showed minimal effects on antioxidant defenses in young (2months) Nrf2-/-mice. Interestingly, mRNA and protein levels of NADH Quinone Oxidase-1 were dramatically (*P&lt;0.001) decreased in Nrf2-/-SM when compared to WT at 2months of age, suggesting central regulation of NQO1 occurs through Nrf2. Subsequent analysis of the Nrf2-dependent transcription and translation showed that the aged mice (>24months) had a significant increase in ROS along with a decrease in glutathione (GSH) levels and impaired antioxidants in Nrf2-/-when compared to WT SM. Further, disruption of Nrf2 appears to induce oxidative stress (increased ROS, HNE-positive proteins), ubiquitination and pro-apoptotic signals in the aged SM of Nrf2-/-mice. These results indicate a direct role for Nrf2/ARE signaling on impairment of antioxidants, which contribute to muscle degradation pathways upon aging. Our findings conclude that though the loss of Nrf2 is not amenable at younger age; it could severely affect the SM defenses upon aging. Thus, Nrf2 signaling might be a potential therapeutic target to protect the SM from age-dependent accumulation of ROS by rescuing redox homeostasis to prevent age-related muscle disorders such as sarcopenia and myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Danon disease (DD) is a monogenic X-linked disorder characterized by cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy and variable degrees of intellectual disability. DD develops due to mutations in the gene encoding lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2). We report on a family exhibiting the clinical phenotype comprising of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and ventricular pre-excitation, myopia and mild myopathy in two male patients and cardiomyopathy and myopia in a female patient. The diagnosis of DD in this family was based on the assessment of the clinical phenotypes and the absence of LAMP2 in skeletal and/or cardiac muscle biopsy specimens. Sequence analysis of the LAMP2 gene and its mRNA revealed a novel LAMP2 mutation (c.940delG) in all three patients. Approximately 25% of the female patient's cardiomyocytes were LAMP2 positive apparently due to the unfavorable skewing of X chromosome inactivation. We further performed qualitative LAMP2 immunohistochemistry on peripheral white blood cells using the smear technique and revealed the absence of LAMP2 in the male patients. LAMP2 expression was further assessed in granulocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD20+ B lymphocytes, CD14+ monocytes and CD56+ natural killer cells by quantitative polychromatic flow cytometry. Whereas the male DD patients lacked LAMP2 in all WBC populations, the female patient expressed LAMP2 in 15.1% and 12.8% of monocytes and granulocytes, respectively. LAMP2 expression ratiometrics of highly vs. weakly expressing WBC populations discriminated the DD patients from the healthy controls. WBCs are thus suitable for initial LAMP2 expression testing when DD is a differential diagnostic option. Moreover, flow cytometry represents a quantitative method to assess the skewing of LAMP2 expression in female heterozygotes. Because LAMP2 is a major protein constituent of the membranes of a number of lysosome-related organelles, we also tested the exocytic capacity of the lytic granules from CD8+ T lymphocytes in the patient samples. The degranulation triggered by a specific stimulus (anti-CD3 antibody) was normal. Therefore, this process can be considered LAMP2 independent in human T cells. The c.940delG mutation results in a putatively truncated protein (p.A314QfsX32), which lacks the transmembrane domain and the cytosolic tail of the wild-type LAMP2. We tested whether this variant becomes exocytosed because of a failure in targeting to late endosomes/lysosomes. Western blotting of cardiac muscle, WBCs and cultured skin fibroblasts (and their culture media) showed no intra- or extracellular truncated LAMP2. By comparing the expression pattern and intracellular targeting in cultured skin fibroblasts of normal LAMP2 isoforms (A, B and C) tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the A314Qfs32-GFP fusion, we found that the A314Qfs32-GFP protein is not even expressed. These observations suggest that the truncated protein is unstable and is co-translationally or early post-translationally degraded.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Previous studies have identified several genetic loci associated with the development of familial inclusion body myopathy. However, there have been few genetic analyses of sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM). In order to explore the molecular basis of sIBM and to investigate genotype-phenotype correlations, we performed a clinicopathological analysis of 21 sIBM patients and screened for mutations in the Desmin, GNE, MYHC2A, VCP, and ZASP genes. All coding exons of the five genes were sequenced directly. Definite IBM was confirmed in 14 cases, probable IBM in three cases, and possible IBM in four cases. No cases showed missense mutations in the Desmin, GNE, or VCP genes. Three patients carried the missense mutation c.2542T>C (p.V805A) in the MYHC2A gene; immunohistochemical staining for MYHC isoforms in these three cases showed atrophy or loss of muscle fibers expressing MYHC IIa or IIx. One patient harbored the missense mutation c.1719G>A (p.V566M) in the ZASP gene; immunohistochemical studies of Z-band-associated proteins revealed Z-band abnormalities. Both of the novel heterogeneous mutations were located in highly evolutionarily conserved domains of their respective genes. Cumulatively, these findings have expanded our understanding of the molecular background of sIBM. However, we advocate further clinicopathology and investigation of additional candidate genes in a larger cohort.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Cofilin-2, a small actin-binding protein and member of the AC protein family that includes cofilin-1 and destrin, is predominantly expressed at sarcomeres in skeletal and cardiac muscles. The role of cofilin-2 in muscle development and function is unclear. In humans, recessive cofilin-2 mutations have been associated with nemaline myopathy with minicores. To investigate the functional role of cofilin-2 in vivo, we generated constitutive and muscle-specific cofilin-2-deficient mice using a cre-loxP strategy. Cofilin-2-deficient mice were similar to their wild-type (WT) littermates at birth, but died by day 8. They were significantly smaller, severely weak and had very little milk in their stomachs. The sarcomeric structure was intact at birth, but by Day 7, skeletal muscles showed severe sarcomeric disruptions starting at the Z-line, along with filamentous actin accumulations consistent with a lack of actin depolymerization activity. Cofilin-2-deficient muscles contained elevated numbers of slow fibers and exhibited upregulation of slow fiber-specific genes. Increased amounts of other sarcomeric proteins including α-actinin-2, α-sarcomeric actin and tropomyosin were also present. While destrin was not expressed in either WT or cofilin-2-deficient muscles, cofilin-1 was similarly expressed in developing myofibers of both genotypes. There was no evidence for compensatory changes in expression of either family member in cofilin-2-deficient tissues. The onset of pathology and weakness in cofilin-2-deficient muscles correlated with normal developmental loss of cofilin-1 expression within myofibers, suggesting that cofilin-1 serves as an early developmental sarcomeric isoform. Overall, cofilin-2, although not critical for muscle development, is essential for muscle maintenance.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>UBXD1 is a member of the poorly understood subfamily of p97 adaptors that do not harbor a ubiquitin association domain or bind ubiquitin-modified proteins. Of clinical importance, p97 mutants found in familial neurodegenerative conditions Inclusion Body Myopathy Paget's disease of the bone and/or Frontotemporal Dementia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis are defective at interacting with UBXD1, indicating that functions regulated by a p97-UBXD1 complex are altered in these diseases. We have performed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis of UBXD1-interacting proteins to identify pathways in which UBXD1 functions. UBXD1 displays prominent association with ERGIC-53, a hexameric type I integral membrane protein that functions in protein trafficking. The UBXD1-ERGIC-53 interaction requires the N-terminal 10 residues of UBXD1 and the C-terminal cytoplasmic 12 amino acid tail of ERGIC-53. Use of p97 and E1 enzyme inhibitors indicate that complex formation between UBXD1 and ERGIC-53 requires the ATPase activity of p97, but not ubiquitin modification. We also performed SILAC-based quantitative proteomic profiling to identify ERGIC-53 interacting proteins. This analysis identified known (e.g. COPI subunits) and novel (Rab3GAP1/2 complex involved in the fusion of vesicles at the cell membrane) interactions that are also mediated through the C terminus of the protein. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting analysis confirmed the proteomic interaction data and it also revealed that an UBXD1-Rab3GAP association requires the ERGIC-53 binding domain of UBXD1. Localization studies indicate that UBXD1 modules the sub-cellular trafficking of ERGIC-53, including promoting movement to the cell membrane. We propose that p97-UBXD1 modulates the trafficking of ERGIC-53-containing vesicles by controlling the interaction of transport factors with the cytoplasmic tail of ERGIC-53.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Miyoshi myopathy is the most common form of recessive distal myopathy. Recessive mutations in the ANO5 gene have been recently identified in Northern Europe as a cause of non dysferlin-linked distal myopathy and limb girdle muscular dystrophy. We report here the first French cases of anoctamin 5 myopathy in 2 brothers presenting with a Miyoshi-like pattern. Comparing these patients with 12 other cases from the literature shows that all cases share a homogeneous clinical pattern, characterized by initial calf muscles involvement. Asymmetric muscle atrophy often precedes weakness. In this setting, high CK level and normal expression of dysferlin in muscle should lead to consider the diagnosis, which will be confirmed by ANO5 gene testing. The c.191dupA mutation, already reported as a founder mutation in Caucasian patients with anoctamin myopathies, was found in our family in a heterozygous state.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To identify the causative gene in an autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) with skeletal muscle vacuoles. METHODS: Exome sequencing was used to identify candidate mutations in the studied pedigree. Genome-wide linkage was then used to narrow the list of candidates to a single disease-associated mutation. Additional pedigrees with dominant or sporadic myopathy were screened for mutations in the same gene (DNAJB6) using exome sequencing. Skeletal muscle from affected patients was evaluated with histochemistry and immunohistochemical stains for dystrophy-related proteins, SMI-31, TDP43, and DNAJB6. RESULTS: Exome analysis in 3 affected individuals from a family with dominant LGMD and vacuolar pathology identified novel candidate mutations in 22 genes. Linkage analysis excluded all variants except a Phe93Leu mutation in the G/F domain of the DNAJB6 gene, which resides within the LGMD locus at 7q36. Analysis of exome sequencing data from other pedigrees with dominant myopathy identified a second G/F domain mutation (Pro96Arg) in DNAJB6. Affected muscle showed mild dystrophic changes, vacuoles, and abnormal aggregation of proteins, including TDP-43 and DNAJB6 itself. INTERPRETATION: Mutations within the G/F domain of DNAJB6 are a novel cause of dominantly-inherited myopathy. DNAJB6 is a member of the HSP40/DNAJ family of molecular co-chaperones tasked with protecting client proteins from irreversible aggregation during protein synthesis or during times of cellular stress. The abnormal accumulation of several proteins in patient muscle, including DNAJB6 itself, suggest that DNAJB6 function is compromised by the identified G/F domain mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a common and devastating type of childhood-onset muscular dystrophy, attributed to an X-linked defect in the gene that encodes dystrophin. Myopathy with DMD is most pronounced in the diaphragm muscle and fast-twitch limb muscles and is dependent upon susceptibility to damage, inflammatory cell infiltration, and proinflammatory signaling (nuclear factor-κB; NF-κB). Although recent papers have reawakened the notion that oxidative stress links inflammatory signaling with pathology in DMD in limb muscle, the importance of redox mechanisms had been clouded by inconsistent results from indirect scavenger approaches, including in the diaphragm muscle. Therefore, we used a novel catalytic mimetic of superoxide dismutase and catalase (EUK-134) as a direct scavenger of oxidative stress in myopathy in the diaphragm of the mdx mouse model. EUK-134 reduced 4-hydroxynonenal and total hydroperoxides, markers of oxidative stress in the mdx diaphragm. EUK-134 also attenuated positive staining of macrophages and T-cells as well as activation of NF-κB and p65 protein abundance. Moreover, EUK-134 ameliorated markers of muscle damage including internalized nuclei, variability of cross-sectional area, and type IIc fibers. Finally, impairment of contractile force was partially rescued by EUK-134 in the diaphragm of mdx mice. We conclude that oxidative stress amplifies DMD pathology in the diaphragm muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlin is a transmembrane protein implicated in surface membrane repair of muscle cells. Mutations in dysferlin cause the progressive muscular dystrophies Miyoshi myopathy, limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B, and distal anterior compartment myopathy. Dysferlinopathies are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and many patients with this disease harbor mis-sense mutations in at least one of their two pathogenic DYSF alleles. These patients have significantly reduced or absent dysferlin levels in skeletal muscle, suggesting that dysferlin encoded by mis-sense alleles is rapidly degraded by the cellular quality control system. We reasoned that mis-sense mutated dysferlin, if salvaged from degradation, might be biologically functional. We used a dysferlin-deficient human myoblast culture harboring the common R555W mis-sense allele and a DYSF-null allele, as well as control human myoblast cultures harboring either two wild-type or two null alleles. We measured dysferlin protein and mRNA levels, resealing kinetics of laser-induced plasmalemmal wounds, myotube formation, and cellular viability after treatment of the human myoblast cultures with the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin or bortezomib (Velcade). We show that endogenous R555W mis-sense mutated dysferlin is degraded by the proteasomal system. Inhibition of the proteasome by lactacystin or Velcade increases the levels of R555W mis-sense mutated dysferlin. This salvaged protein is functional as it restores plasma membrane resealing in patient-derived myoblasts and reverses their deficit in myotube formation. Bortezomib and lactacystin did not cause cellular toxicity at the regimen used. Our results raise the possibility that inhibition of the degradation pathway of mis-sense mutated dysferlin could be used as a therapeutic strategy for patients harboring certain dysferlin mis-sense mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Maintenance of skeletal muscle structure and function requires efficient and precise metabolic control. Autophagy plays a key role in metabolic homeostasis of diverse tissues by recycling cellular constituents, particularly under conditions of caloric restriction, thereby normalizing cellular metabolism. Here we show that histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1 and 2 control skeletal muscle homeostasis and autophagy flux in mice. Skeletal muscle-specific deletion of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 results in perinatal lethality of a subset of mice, accompanied by mitochondrial abnormalities and sarcomere degeneration. Mutant mice that survive the first day of life develop a progressive myopathy characterized by muscle degeneration and regeneration, and abnormal metabolism resulting from a blockade to autophagy. HDAC1 and HDAC2 regulate skeletal muscle autophagy by mediating the induction of autophagic gene expression and the formation of autophagosomes, such that myofibers of mice lacking these HDACs accumulate toxic autophagic intermediates. Strikingly, feeding HDAC1/2 mutant mice a high-fat diet from the weaning age releases the block in autophagy and prevents myopathy in adult mice. These findings reveal an unprecedented and essential role for HDAC1 and HDAC2 in maintenance of skeletal muscle structure and function and show that, at least in some pathological conditions, myopathy may be mitigated by dietary modifications.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The m.3243A>G variant in the mitochondrial tRNA(Leu(UUR)) gene is a common mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation. Phenotypic manifestations depend mainly on the heteroplasmy, i.e. the ratio of mutant to normal mtDNA copies. A high percentage of mutant mtDNA is associated with a severe, life-threatening neurological syndrome known as MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes). MELAS is described as a neurovascular disorder primarily affecting the brain and blood vessels, but the pathophysiology of the disease is poorly understood. We developed a series of cybrid cell lines at two different mutant loads: 70% and 100% in the nuclear background of a neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y). We investigated the impact of the mutation on the metabolism and mitochondrial respiratory chain activity of the cybrids. The m.3243A>G mitochondrial mutation induced a metabolic switch towards glycolysis in the neuronal cells and produced severe defects in respiratory chain assembly and activity. We used two strategies to compensate for the biochemical defects in the mutant cells: one consisted of lowering the glucose content in the culture medium, and the other involved the addition of l-arginine. The reduction of glucose significantly shifted the 100% mutant cells towards the wild-type, reaching a 90% mutant level and restoring respiratory chain complex assembly. The addition of l-arginine, a nitric oxide (NO) donor, improved complex I activity in the mutant cells in which the defective NO metabolism had led to a relative shortage of NO. Thus, metabolically induced heteroplasmy shifting and l-arginine therapy may constitute promising therapeutic strategies against MELAS.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the store-operated Ca²⁺ entry pore protein ORAI1 have been reported to cause myopathies in human patients but the mechanism involved is not known. Cardiomyocytes express ORAI1 but its role in heart function is also unknown. Using reverse genetics in zebrafish, we demonstrated that inactivation of the highly conserved zebrafish orthologue of ORAI1 resulted in severe heart failure, reduced ventricular systolic function, bradycardia and skeletal muscle weakness. Electron microscopy of Orai1-deficient myocytes revealed progressive skeletal muscle instability with loss of myofiber integrity and ultrastructural abnormalities of the z-disc in both skeletal and cardiac muscle. Isolated Orai1-deficient cardiomyocytes showed loss of the calcineurin-associated protein calsarcin from the z-discs. Furthermore, we found mechanosignal transduction was affected in Orai1-depleted hearts, indicating an essential role for ORAI1 in establishing the cardiac signaling transduction machinery at the z-disc. Our findings identify ORAI1 as an important regulator of cardiac and skeletal muscle function and provide evidence linking ORAI1-mediated calcium signaling to sarcomere integrity and cardiomyocyte function.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlinopathy refers to autosomal recessive muscular dystrophies caused by mutations in dysferlin gene (DYSF). It includes two major distinct disorders, Miyoshi myopathy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B. Twenty-three Korean patients were recruited. Full sequence analysis of DYSF detected 10 novel and 9 known mutations. The p.Gln832X showed the highest allele frequency (10/46) as a unique recurrent mutation among Korean population, and two common mutations (p.Gln832X and c.663+1G>C) accounted for 34.8% of the identified mutations. Korean DYSF mutations appeared to cluster in the N-terminal region. Notably, none of homozygous mutations was found in this study. Clinical features were similar to previous reports showing onset in early adulthood, high serum CK and inflammatory reactions on muscle pathology. In Miyoshi myopathy, gastrocnemius muscle was first affected on muscle CT scans, and anterior lower legs and thigh muscles were then affected with disease progression. Despite the genetic variety of DYSF mutations, clinical features were rather invariable among the patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Exome sequencing of an individual with congenital cataracts, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, and lactic acidosis, all typical symptoms of Sengers syndrome, discovered two nonsense mutations in the gene encoding mitochondrial acylglycerol kinase (AGK). Mutation screening of AGK in further individuals with congenital cataracts and cardiomyopathy identified numerous loss-of-function mutations in an additional eight families, confirming the causal nature of AGK deficiency in Sengers syndrome. The loss of AGK led to a decrease of the adenine nucleotide translocator in the inner mitochondrial membrane in muscle, consistent with a role of AGK in driving the assembly of the translocator as a result of its effects on phospholipid metabolism in mitochondria.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>p97/valosin-containing protein (VCP) is a type II ATPase associated with various cellular activities that forms a homohexamer with each protomer containing an N-terminal domain (N-domain); two ATPase domains, D1 and D2; and a disordered C-terminal region. Little is known about the role of the N-domain or the C-terminal region in the p97 ATPase cycle. In the p97-associated human disease inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia, the majority of missense mutations are located at the N-domain D1 interface. Structure-based predictions suggest that such mutations affect the interaction of the N-domain with D1. Here we have tested ten major inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia-linked mutants for ATPase activity and found that all have increased activity over the wild type, with one mutant, p97(A232E), having three times higher activity. Further mutagenesis of p97(A232E) shows that the increase in ATPase activity is mediated through D2 and requires both the N-domain and a flexible ND1 linker. A disulfide mutation that locks the N-domain to D1 in a coplanar position reversibly abrogates ATPase activity. A cryo-EM reconstruction of p97(A232E) suggests that the N-domains are flexible. Removal of the C-terminal region also reduces ATPase activity. Taken together, our data suggest that the conformation of the N-domain in relation to the D1-D2 hexamer is directly linked to ATP hydrolysis and that the C-terminal region is required for hexamer stability. This leads us to propose a model where the N-domain adopts either of two conformations: a flexible conformation compatible with ATP hydrolysis or a coplanar conformation that is inactive.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report on an autosomal-recessive variant of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) characterized by severe muscle hypotonia at birth, progressive scoliosis, joint hypermobility, hyperelastic skin, myopathy, sensorineural hearing impairment, and normal pyridinoline excretion in urine. Clinically, the disorder shares many features with the kyphoscoliotic type of EDS (EDS VIA) and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy. Linkage analysis in a large Tyrolean kindred identified a homozygous frameshift mutation in FKBP14 in two affected individuals. Based on the cardinal clinical characteristics of the disorder, four additional individuals originating from different European countries were identified who carried either homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in FKBP14. FKBP14 belongs to the family of FK506-binding peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases). ER-resident FKBPs have been suggested to act as folding catalysts by accelerating cis-trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds and to act occasionally also as chaperones. We demonstrate that FKBP14 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and that deficiency of FKBP14 leads to enlarged ER cisterns in dermal fibroblasts in vivo. Furthermore, indirect immunofluorescence of FKBP14-deficient fibroblasts indicated an altered assembly of the extracellular matrix in vitro. These findings suggest that a disturbance of protein folding in the ER affecting one or more components of the extracellular matrix might cause the generalized connective tissue involvement in this disorder. FKBP14 mutation analysis should be considered in all individuals with apparent kyphoscoliotic type of EDS and normal urinary pyridinoline excretion, in particular in conjunction with sensorineural hearing impairment.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the key enzyme of sialic acid biosynthesis, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetyl-mannosamine kinase, result in distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV)/hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) in humans. Sialic acid is an acidic monosaccharide that modifies non-reducing terminal carbohydrate chains on glycoproteins and glycolipids, and it plays an important role in cellular adhesions and interactions. In this study, we generated mice with a V572L point mutation in the GNE kinase domain. Unexpectedly, these mutant mice had no apparent myopathies or motor dysfunctions. However, they had a short lifespan and exhibited renal impairment with massive albuminuria. Histological analysis showed enlarged glomeruli with mesangial matrix deposition, leading to glomerulosclerosis and abnormal podocyte foot process morphologies in the kidneys. Glycan analysis using several lectins revealed glomerular epithelial cell hyposialylation, particularly the hyposialylation of podocalyxin, which is one of important molecules for the glomerular filtration barrier. Administering Neu5Ac to the mutant mice from embryonic stages significantly suppressed the albuminuria and renal pathology, and partially recovered the glomerular glycoprotein sialylation. These findings suggest that the nephrotic-like syndrome observed in these mutant mice resulted from impaired glomerular filtration due to the hyposialylation of podocyte glycoproteins, including podocalyxin. Furthermore, it was possible to prevent the nephrotic-like disease in these mice by beginning Neu5Ac treatment during gestation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the gene encoding the immunoglobulin-superfamily member cell adhesion molecule contactin1 (CNTN1) cause lethal congenital myopathy in human patients and neurodevelopmental phenotypes in knockout mice. Whether the mutant mice provide an accurate model of the human disease is unclear; resolving this will require additional functional tests of the neuromuscular system and examination of Cntn1 mutations on different genetic backgrounds that may influence the phenotype. Toward these ends, we have analyzed a new, spontaneous mutation in the mouse Cntn1 gene that arose in a BALB/c genetic background. The overt phenotype is very similar to the knockout of Cntn1, with affected animals having reduced body weight, a failure to thrive, locomotor abnormalities, and a lifespan of 2-3 weeks. Mice homozygous for the new allele have CNTN1 protein undetectable by western blotting, suggesting that it is a null or very severe hypomorph. In an analysis of neuromuscular function, neuromuscular junctions had normal morphology, consistent with previous studies in knockout mice, and the muscles were able to generate appropriate force when normalized for their reduced size in late stage animals. Therefore, the Cntn1 mutant mice do not show evidence for a myopathy, but instead the phenotype is likely to be caused by dysfunction in the nervous system. Given the similarity of CNTN1 to other Ig-superfamily proteins such as DSCAMs, we also characterized the expression and localization of Cntn1 in the retinas of mutant mice for developmental defects. Despite widespread expression, no anomalies in retinal anatomy were detected histologically or using a battery of cell-type specific antibodies. We therefore conclude that the phenotype of the Cntn1 mice arises from dysfunction in the brain, spinal cord or peripheral nervous system, and is similar in either a BALB/c or B6;129;Black Swiss background, raising a possible discordance between the mouse and human phenotypes resulting from Cntn1 mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>GNE myopathy (MIM 600737) is an autosomal recessive muscle disease caused by mutations in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene. Besides the typical phenotype, characterized by the initial involvement of the distal leg muscles that eventually spreads proximally with sparing of the quadriceps, uncommon presentations with a non-canonical clinical phenotype, unusual muscle biopsy findings or both are increasingly recognized. The aim of our study was to characterize the imaging pattern of pelvic and lower limb muscles in GNE myopathy, thus providing additional diagnostic clues useful in the identification of patients with atypical features. We retrospectively evaluated muscle MRI and CT scans of a cohort of 13 patients heterogeneous for GNE mutations and degree of clinical severity. We found that severe involvement of the biceps femoris short head and, to a lesser extent, of the gluteus minimus, tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis and digitorum longus, soleus and gastrocnemius medialis was consistently present even in patients with early or atypical disease. The vastus lateralis, not the entire quadriceps, was the only muscle spared in advanced stages, while the rectus femoris, vastus intermedius and medialis showed variable signs of fatty replacement. Younger patients showed hyperintensities on T2-weighted sequences in muscles with a normal or, more often, abnormal T1-weighted signal. Our results define a pattern of muscle involvement that appears peculiar to GNE myopathy. Although these findings need to be further validated in a larger cohort, we believe that the recognition of this pattern may be instrumental in the initial clinical assessment of patients with possible GNE myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Collagen VI is a major extracellular matrix (ECM) protein with a critical role in maintaining skeletal muscle functional integrity. Mutations in COL6A1, COL6A2 and COL6A3 genes cause Ullrich Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (UCMD), Bethlem Myopathy, and Myosclerosis. Moreover, Col6a1(-/-) mice and collagen VI deficient zebrafish display a myopathic phenotype. Recently, two additional collagen VI chains were identified in humans, the α5 and α6 chains, however their distribution patterns and functions in human skeletal muscle have not been thoroughly investigated yet. By means of immunofluorescence analysis, the α6 chain was detected in the endomysium and perimysium, while the α5 chain labeling was restricted to the myotendinous junctions. In normal muscle cultures, the α6 chain was present in traces in the ECM, while the α5 chain was not detected. In the absence of ascorbic acid, the α6 chain was mainly accumulated into the cytoplasm of a sub-set of desmin negative cells, likely of interstitial origin, which can be considered myofibroblasts as they expressed α-smooth muscle actin. TGF-β1 treatment, a pro-fibrotic factor which induces trans-differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, increased the α6 chain deposition in the extracellular matrix after addition of ascorbic acid. In order to define the involvement of the α6 chain in muscle fibrosis we studied biopsies of patients affected by Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). We found that the α6 chain was dramatically up-regulated in fibrotic areas where, in contrast, the α5 chain was undetectable. Our results show a restricted and differential distribution of the novel α6 and α5 chains in skeletal muscle when compared to the widely distributed, homologous α3 chain, suggesting that these new chains may play specific roles in specialized ECM structures. While the α5 chain may have a specialized function in tissue areas subjected to tensile stress, the α6 chain appears implicated in ECM remodeling during muscle fibrosis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Treatment-resistant muscle wasting is an increasingly recognized problem in idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM). TNF-α is thought to induce muscle catabolism via activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). Several genes share homology with the NF-κB family of proteins. This study investigated the role of NF-κB-related genes in disease susceptibility in UK Caucasian IIM. METHODS: Data from 362 IIM cases [274 adults, 49 (±14.0) years, 72% female; 88 juveniles, 6 (±3.6) years, 73% female) were compared with 307 randomly selected Caucasian controls. DNA was genotyped for 63 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from NF-κB-related genes. Data were stratified by IIM subgroup/serotype. RESULTS: A significant allele association was observed in the overall IIM group vs controls for the IKBL-62T allele (rs2071592, odds ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.21, 1.89, corrected P = 0.0086), which strengthened after stratification by anti-Jo-1 or -PM-Scl antibodies. Genotype analysis revealed an increase for the AT genotype in cases under a dominant model. No other SNP was associated in the overall IIM group. Strong pairwise linkage disequilibrium was noted between IKBL-62T, TNF-308A and HLA-B*08 (D' = 1). Using multivariate regression, the IKBL-62T IIM association was lost after adjustment for TNF-308A or HLA-B*08. CONCLUSION: An association was noted between IKBL-62T and IIM, with increased risk noted in anti-Jo-1- and -PM-Scl antibody-positive patients. However, the IKBL-62T association is dependent on TNF-308A and HLA-B*08, due to strong shared linkage disequilibrium between these alleles. After adjustment of the 8.1 HLA haplotype, NF-κB genes therefore do not independently confer susceptibility in IIM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>ATP7A is a P-type ATPase that regulates cellular copper homeostasis by activity at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and plasma membrane (PM), with the location normally governed by intracellular copper concentration. Defects in ATP7A lead to Menkes disease or its milder variant, occipital horn syndrome or to a newly discovered condition, ATP7A-related distal motor neuropathy (DMN), for which the precise pathophysiology has been obscure. We investigated two ATP7A motor neuropathy mutations (T994I, P1386S) previously associated with abnormal intracellular trafficking. In the patients' fibroblasts, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy indicated a shift in steady-state equilibrium of ATP7A(T994I) and ATP7A(P1386S), with exaggerated PM localization. Transfection of Hek293T cells and NSC-34 motor neurons with the mutant alleles tagged with the Venus fluorescent protein also revealed excess PM localization. Endocytic retrieval of the mutant alleles from the PM to the TGN was impaired. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed an abnormal interaction between ATP7A(T994I) and p97/VCP, an ubiquitin-selective chaperone which is mutated in two autosomal dominant forms of motor neuron disease: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and inclusion body myopathy with early-onset Paget disease and fronto-temporal dementia. Small-interfering RNA (SiRNA) knockdown of p97/VCP corrected ATP7A(T994I) mislocalization. Flow cytometry documented that non-permeabilized ATP7A(P1386S) fibroblasts bound a carboxyl-terminal ATP7A antibody, consistent with relocation of the ATP7A di-leucine endocytic retrieval signal to the extracellular surface and partially destabilized insertion of the eighth transmembrane helix. Our findings illuminate the mechanisms underlying ATP7A-related DMN and establish a link between p97/VCP and genetically distinct forms of motor neuron degeneration.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) is expressed widely in the brain, with high levels in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. We have shown that L-type Ca(2+) channels in terminals of hypothalamic magnocellular neurons are coupled to RyRs, as they are in skeletal muscle, allowing voltage-induced Ca(2+) release (VICaR) from internal Ca(2+) stores without Ca(2+) influx. Here we demonstrate that RyR1 plays a role in VICaR in nerve terminals. Furthermore, in heterozygotes from the Ryr1(I4895T/WT) (IT/+) mouse line, carrying a knock-in mutation corresponding to one that causes a severe form of human central core disease, VICaR is absent, demonstrating that type 1 RyR mediates VICaR and that these mice have a neuronal phenotype. The absence of VICaR was shown in two ways: first, depolarization in the absence of Ca(2+) influx elicited Ca(2+)syntillas (scintilla, spark, in a nerve terminal, a SYNaptic structure) in WT, but not in mutant terminals; second, in the presence of extracellular Ca(2+), IT/+ terminals showed a twofold decrease in global Ca(2+) transients, with no change in plasmalemmal Ca(2+) current. From these studies we draw two conclusions: (i) RyR1 plays a role in VICaR in hypothalamic nerve terminals; and (ii) a neuronal alteration accompanies the myopathy in IT/+ mice, and, possibly in humans carrying the corresponding RyR1 mutation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Ariel is a mouse mutant that suffers from skeletal muscle myofibrillar degeneration due to the rapid accumulation of large intracellular protein aggregates. This fulminant disease is caused by an ENU-induced recessive mutation resulting in an L342Q change within the motor domain of the skeletal muscle myosin protein MYH4 (MyHC IIb). Although normal at birth, homozygous mice develop hindlimb paralysis from Day 13, consistent with the timing of the switch from developmental to adult myosin isoforms in mice. The mutated myosin (MYH4(L342Q)) is an aggregate-prone protein. Notwithstanding the speed of the process, biochemical analysis of purified aggregates showed the presence of proteins typically found in human myofibrillar myopathies, suggesting that the genesis of ariel aggregates follows a pathogenic pathway shared with other conformational protein diseases of skeletal muscle. In contrast, heterozygous mice are overtly and histologically indistinguishable from control mice. MYH4(L342Q) is present in muscles from heterozygous mice at only 7% of the levels of the wild-type protein, resulting in a small but significant increase in force production in isolated single fibres and indicating that elimination of the mutant protein in heterozygotes prevents the pathological changes observed in homozygotes. Recapitulation of the L342Q change in the functional equivalent of mouse MYH4 in human muscles, MYH1, results in a more aggregate-prone protein.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons in the motor cortex, brain stem and spinal cord. Mutations in the valosin-containing protein gene (VCP) were recently described in ALS families. Some of these families included diagnoses of other clinical features including frontotemporal dementia, Paget's disease, inclusion body myopathy, Parkinsonism and limb weakness. We sought to determine the prevalence of VCP mutations in Australian familial (n = 131) and sporadic (n = 48) ALS cohorts diagnosed with classic ALS. No mutations were identified indicating that VCP mutations are not a common cause of classic ALS among Australian cases with predominantly European ancestry.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVES: Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV) is a typical autosomal recessive hereditary inclusion body myopathy, characterized by slowly progressive distal muscle weakness with relative sparing of the quadriceps. This study aimed to investigate  the variability of clinical and morphological presentation and the spectrum of Glucosamine (UDP-N-acetyl)-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) mutations in Chinese DMRV patients. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 37 patients with DMRV in PLA General  Hospital from 1986 to 2011, and further conducted a review of 16 reported Chinese DMRV patients from other hospitals. We systematically analyzed the clinical, muscle morphological features and GNE gene mutation status of all DMRV patients. RESULTS: A total of 53 DMRV patients were  studied. Fourteen cases had family history and other 39 cases were sporadic. Fifteen cases showed atypical pathological presentation as mononuclear cell invasion into necrotic or non-necrotic muscle fibers. Rare initial symptom, earlier age of onset and more dysmorphic presentations were shown  in sporadic patients. Eighteen mutations in GNE gene were identified. c.317T>C (p.I106T) was a novel GNE gene mutation. c.1892C>T (p.A631V), c.527A>T (p.D176V) and c.1523T>C (p.L508S) were the common GNE mutations in Chinese DMRV patients. DISCUSSION: The clinical, pathological  and genetic characteristics of DMRV are distinct in Chinese patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Dysferlinopathies are caused by mutations in the dysferlin gene (DYSF). Diagnosis is complex due to the high clinical variability of the disease and because dysferlin expression in the muscle biopsy may be secondarily reduced due to a primary defect in some other gene. Dysferlin is also expressed in peripheral blood monocytes (PBM). Studying dysferlin in monocytes is used for the diagnosis of dysferlin myopathies. The aim of the study was to determine whether dysferlin expression in PBM correlates with that in skeletal muscle. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using western-blot (WB) we quantified dysferlin expression in PBM from 21 pathological controls with other myopathies in whom mutations in DYSF were excluded and from 17 patients who had dysferlinopathy and two mutations in DYSF. Results were compared with protein expression in muscle by WB and immunohistochemistry (IH). We found a good correlation between skeletal muscle and monocytes using WB. However, IH results were misleading because abnormal expression of dysferlin was also observed in 13/21 pathological controls. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The analysis of dysferlin protein expression in PBM is helpful when: 1) the skeletal muscle IH pattern is abnormal or 2) when muscle WB can not be performed either because muscle sample is lacking or insufficient or because the muscle biopsy is taken from a muscle at an end-stage and it mainly consists of fat and fibrotic tissue.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>MFN2 and OPA1 genes encode two dynamin-like GTPase proteins involved in the fusion of the mitochondrial membrane. They have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A and autosomal dominant optic atrophy, respectively. We report a large family with optic atrophy beginning in early childhood, associated with axonal neuropathy and mitochondrial myopathy in adult life. The clinical presentation looks like the autosomal dominant optic atrophy 'plus' phenotype linked to OPA1 mutations but is associated with a novel MFN2 missense mutation (c.629A>T, p.D210V). Multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions were found in skeletal muscle and this observation makes MFN2 a novel gene associated with 'mitochondrial DNA breakage' syndrome. Contrary to previous studies in patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A, fibroblasts carrying the MFN2 mutation present with a respiratory chain deficiency, a fragmentation of the mitochondrial network and a significant reduction of MFN2 protein expression. Furthermore, we show for the first time that impaired mitochondrial fusion is responsible for a deficiency to repair stress-induced mitochondrial DNA damage. It is likely that defect in mitochondrial DNA repair is due to variability in repair protein content across the mitochondrial population and is at least partially responsible for mitochondrial DNA instability.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: The ANT1 gene, encoding ADP/ATP translocase 1, was investigated in an adult patient with an autosomal recessive mitochondrial disorder characterised by congenital cataracts, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myopathy and lactic acidosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: ANT1 sequencing showed that the patient was homozygous for a new nucleotide variation, c.111+1G→A, abolishing the invariant GT splice donor site of intron 1. The ANT1 transcript was undetectable in both muscle and skin fibroblasts. A markedly abnormal metabolic profile was found, and skeletal muscle showed a dramatic proliferation of abnormal mitochondria, increased mitochondrial mass, and multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions. No compensating increase in the transcript level of the ANT3 gene, which encodes the human ubiquitous isoform of the ADP/ATP translocase, was observed. The patient's heterozygous mother had normal clinical, biochemical and pathological features. CONCLUSIONS: Complete loss of expression of the ANT1 gene causes a clinical syndrome mainly characterised by cardiomyopathy and myopathy. This report expands the clinical spectrum of ANT1-related human diseases, and emphasises the crucial role of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers in muscle function and pathophysiology of human myopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We have generated a new mouse model for congenital myasthenic syndromes by inserting the missense mutation L221F into the ε subunit of the acetylcholine receptor by homologous recombination. This mutation has been identified in man to cause a mild form of slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome with variable penetrance. In our mouse model we observe as in human patients prolonged endplate currents. The summation of endplate potentials may account for a depolarization block at increasing stimulus frequencies, moderate reduced muscle strength and tetanic fade. Calcium and intracellular vesicle accumulation as well as junctional fold loss and organelle degeneration underlying a typical endplate myopathy, were identified. Moreover, a remodeling of neuromuscular junctions occurs in a muscle-dependent pattern expressing variable phenotypic effects. Altogether, this mouse model provides new insight into the pathophysiology of congenital myasthenia and serves as a new tool for deciphering signaling pathways induced by excitotoxicity at peripheral synapses.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathy is one of the most common and severe non-dystrophic muscle diseases of childhood. Patients typically present in infancy with hypotonia, weakness, delayed motor development, and bulbar and respiratory difficulties. Mutations in six different genes are associated with nemaline myopathy, with nebulin mutations being the most common. No treatments or disease-modifying therapies have been identified for this disease. One of the major barriers to treatment development is the lack of models amenable to rapid and coordinated testing of potential therapeutic strategies. To overcome this barrier, we have characterized the first zebrafish model of nemaline myopathy. This model, termed neb, harbors a recessive mutation in the nebulin gene that results in decreased Nebulin protein levels, a severe motor phenotype and premature lethality. In addition to impaired motor function, neb zebrafish exhibit many of the features associated with human nemaline myopathy. These include impaired force generation, altered thin filament length and the presence of specific histopathological changes, including the formation of nemaline bodies. In summary, neb zebrafish mirror the genetic, clinical and pathological aspects of nemaline myopathy due to NEB mutation, and thus are an excellent model for future therapy development for this devastating disorder.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is central to the control of cell, organ, and body size. Skeletal muscle-specific inactivation of mTORC1 in mice results in smaller muscle fibers, fewer mitochondria, increased glycogen stores, and a progressive myopathy that causes premature death. In mTORC1-deficient muscles, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α), which regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and glucose homeostasis, is strongly down-regulated. Here we tested whether induction of mitochondrial biogenesis pharmacologically or by the overexpression of PGC-1α is sufficient to reverse the phenotype of mice deficient for mTORC1. We show that both approaches normalize mitochondrial function, such as oxidative capacity and expression of mitochondrial genes. However, they do not prevent or delay the progressive myopathy. In addition, we find that mTORC1 has a much stronger effect than PGC-1α on the glycogen content in muscle. This effect is based on the strong activation of PKB/Akt in mTORC1-deficient mice. We also show that activation of PKB/Akt not only affects glycogen synthesis but also diminishes glycogen degradation. Thus, our work provides strong functional evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction in mice with inactivated mTORC1 signaling is caused by the down-regulation of PGC-1α. However, our data also show that the impairment of mitochondria does not lead directly to the lethal myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotonic dystrophy type 1 and type 2 (DM1 and DM2) are genetic diseases in which mutant transcripts containing expanded CUG or CCUG repeats cause cellular dysfunction by altering the processing or metabolism of specific mRNAs and miRNAs. The toxic effects of mutant RNA are mediated partly through effects on proteins that regulate alternative splicing. Here we show that alternative splicing of exon 29 (E29) of Ca(V)1.1, a calcium channel that controls skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling, is markedly repressed in DM1 and DM2. The extent of E29 skipping correlated with severity of weakness in tibialis anterior muscle of DM1 patients. Two splicing factors previously implicated in DM1, MBNL1 and CUGBP1, participated in the regulation of E29 splicing. In muscle fibers of wild-type mice, the Ca(V)1.1 channel conductance and voltage sensitivity were increased by splice-shifting oligonucleotides that induce E29 skipping. In contrast to human DM1, expression of CUG-expanded RNA caused only a modest increase in E29 skipping in mice. However, forced skipping of E29 in these mice, to levels approaching those observed in human DM1, aggravated the muscle pathology as evidenced by increased central nucleation. Together, these results indicate that DM-associated splicing defects alter Ca(V)1.1 function, with potential for exacerbation of myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene, already known to be associated with the multisystemic disorder, inclusion body myopathy with Paget's disease and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD), have been recently found also in familial cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To further define the frequency of VCP mutations in ALS Italian population, we screened a cohort of 166 familial ALS and 14 ALS-frontotemporal dementia (FTD) individuals. We identified a previously reported synonymous mutation (c.2093A>C; p.Q568Q), 2 intronic variants (c.1749-14C>T; c.2085-3C>T), and 1 nucleotide change (c.2814G>T) in the 3' untranslated region (UTR). Bioinformatical analyses predicted no changes in splicing process or microRNA binding sites. Our results do not confirm a main contribution of VCP gene to familial ALS in the Italian population.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Lipin-1 catalyzes the formation of diacylglycerol from phosphatidic acid. Lipin-1 mutations cause lipodystrophy in mice and acute myopathy in humans. It is heavily phosphorylated, and the yeast ortholog Pah1p becomes membrane-associated and active upon dephosphorylation by the Nem1p-Spo7p membrane complex. A mammalian ortholog of Nem1p is the C-terminal domain nuclear envelope phosphatase 1 (CTDNEP1, formerly "dullard"), but its Spo7p-like partner is unknown, and the need for its existence is debated. Here, we identify the metazoan ortholog of Spo7p, TMEM188, renamed nuclear envelope phosphatase 1-regulatory subunit 1 (NEP1-R1). CTDNEP1 and NEP1-R1 together complement a nem1Δspo7Δ strain to block endoplasmic reticulum proliferation and restore triacylglycerol levels and lipid droplet number. The two human orthologs are in a complex in cells, and the amount of CTDNEP1 is increased in the presence of NEP1-R1. In the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, expression of nematode CTDNEP1 and NEP1-R1, as well as lipin-1, is required for normal nuclear membrane breakdown after zygote formation. The expression pattern of NEP1-R1 and CTDNEP1 in human and mouse tissues closely mirrors that of lipin-1. CTDNEP1 can dephosphorylate lipins-1a, -1b, and -2 in human cells only in the presence of NEP1-R1. The nuclear fraction of lipin-1b is increased when CTDNEP1 and NEP1-R1 are co-expressed. Therefore, NEP1-R1 is functionally conserved from yeast to humans and functions in the lipin activation pathway.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the detailed clinical findings and underlying genetic defect in 3 presumably related Bulgarian families displaying dominantly transmitted adult onset distal myopathy with upper limb predominance. METHODS: We performed neurologic, electrophysiologic, radiologic, and histopathologic analyses of 13 patients and 13 at-risk but asymptomatic individuals from 3 generations. Genome-wide parametric linkage analysis was followed by bidirectional sequencing of the filamin C (FLNC) gene. We characterized the identified nonsense mutation at cDNA and protein level. RESULTS: Based on clinical findings, no known myopathy subtype was implicated in our distal myopathy patients. Light microscopic analysis of affected muscle tissue showed no specific hallmarks; however, the electron microscopy revealed changes compatible with myofibrillar myopathy. Linkage studies delineated a 9.76 Mb region on chromosome 7q22.1-q35 containing filamin C (FLNC), a gene previously associated with myofibrillar myopathy. Mutation analysis revealed a novel c.5160delC frameshift deletion in all patients of the 3 families. The mutation results in a premature stop codon (p.Phe1720LeufsX63) that triggers nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. FLNC transcript levels were reduced in muscle and lymphoblast cells from affected subjects and partial loss of FLNC in muscle tissue was confirmed by protein analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The FLNC mutation that we identified is distinct in terms of the associated phenotype, muscle morphology, and underlying molecular mechanism, thus extending the currently recognized clinical and genetic spectrum of filaminopathies. We conclude that filamin C is a dosage-sensitive gene and that FLNC haploinsufficiency can cause a specific type of myopathy in humans.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutation T4825I in the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RYR1(T4825I/+)) confers human malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS). We report a knock-in mouse line that expresses the isogenetic mutation T4826I. Heterozygous RYR1(T4826I/+) (Het) or homozygous RYR1(T4826I/T4826I) (Hom) mice are fully viable under typical rearing conditions but exhibit genotype- and sex-dependent susceptibility to environmental conditions that trigger MH. Hom mice maintain higher core temperatures than WT in the home cage, have chronically elevated myoplasmic[Ca(2+)](rest), and present muscle damage in soleus with a strong sex bias. Mice subjected to heat stress in an enclosed 37°C chamber fail to trigger MH regardless of genotype, whereas heat stress at 41°C invariably triggers fulminant MH in Hom, but not Het, mice within 20 min. WT and Het female mice fail to maintain euthermic body temperature when placed atop a bed whose surface is 37°C during halothane anesthesia (1.75%) and have no hyperthermic response, whereas 100% Hom mice of either sex and 17% of the Het males develop fulminant MH. WT mice placed on a 41°C bed maintain body temperature while being administered halothane, and 40% of the Het females and 100% of the Het males develop fulminant MH within 40 min. Myopathic alterations in soleus were apparent by 12 mo, including abnormally distributed and enlarged mitochondria, deeply infolded sarcolemma, and frequent Z-line streaming regions, which were more severe in males. These data demonstrate that an MHS mutation within the S4-S5 cytoplasmic linker of RYR1 confers genotype- and sex-dependent susceptibility to pharmacological and environmental stressors that trigger fulminant MH and promote myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hereditary myopathy with lactic acidosis (HML) is caused by an intron mutation in the iron-sulfur cluster assembly gene ISCU, which leads to the activation of cryptic splice sites and the retention of part of intron 4. This incorrect splicing is more pronounced in muscle than in other tissues, resulting in a muscle-specific phenotype. In this study, we identified five nuclear factors that interact with the sequence harboring the mutation and analyzed their effect on the splicing of the ISCU gene. The identification revealed three splicing factors, SFRS14, RBM39, and PTBP1, and two additional RNA binding factors, matrin 3 (MATR3) and IGF2BP1. IGF2BP1 showed a preference for the mutant sequence, whereas the other factors showed similar affinity for both sequences. PTBP1 was found to repress the defective splicing of ISCU, resulting in a drastic loss of mutant transcripts. In contrast, IGF2BP1 and RBM39 shifted the splicing ratio toward the incorrect splice form.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome is an autosomal recessive, multiorgan disorder with cardinal features of cerebellar ataxia, congenital or early childhood cataracts, psychomotor retardation, myopathy, and short stature. Mutations in the SIL1 gene on chromosome 5q31 were demonstrated to cause Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome. We describe two Turkish patients with clinical characteristics of Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome, but without mutations in SIL1. These two patients also manifested cerebral white matter involvement in cranial imaging, which was previously described in Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome. Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome is genetically heterogeneous, and mutations of SIL1 are often not evident. Consequently, we presume that new genes for Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome await discovery. New genes hold the promise of furthering the mechanistic understanding of the condition, enabling clinically meaningful genetic classification schemes to be designed.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Severe forms of myotubular myopathy (MTM) and congenital myotonic dystrophy type 1 (CDM), both present as floppy infants with hypotonia, respiratory failure and bulbar insufficiency. Muscle biopsy is often performed as part of the diagnostic process, but these two disorders share very similar histopathological features. It is well documented that CDM muscle has nuclear foci that contain muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) protein. In muscle biopsies from eight neonates showing central nuclei, MBNL1 immunolocalisation identified discrete, intensely stained foci in three cases that were subsequently confirmed as CDM by DNA analysis. In the five remaining non-CDM patients and two controls, MBNL1 staining was heterogeneous in nuclei, not as foci. MBNL1 staining patterns in CDM were easily distinguishable from MTM. We suggest that in cases of hypotonia with suspected CDM or MTM, when biopsy has been taken, sections should additionally be stained for MBNL1 to provide a rapid indication of a CDM diagnosis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The term myofibrillar myopathies (MFM) refers to uncommon neuromuscular disorders that pathologically are characterized by myofibrillar degeneration and ectopic expression of several proteins. MFM are partly caused by mutations in genes that encode mainly Z-disk-related proteins (desmin, alphaB-crystallin, myotilin, ZASP, filamin C and BAG3). We reviewed clinical, light and electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting and genetic findings of 21 patients with MFM (15 unrelated patients and three pairs of brothers) investigated at our neuromuscular center. MFM patients begin to show symptoms at any age, from juvenile to late adult life and present a different distribution of muscle weakness. Cardiac involvement and peripheral neuropathy are common. Typical histological features include focal areas with reduction/loss of ATPase and oxidative enzyme activity, and amorphous material (eosinophilic on hematoxylin and eosin and dark blue on Engel-Gomori trichrome) in these abnormal fiber areas. Electron microscopy shows disintegration of myofibrils starting from the Z-disk and accumulation of granular and filamentous material among the myofilaments. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate focal accumulation of desmin, alphaB-crystallin and myotilin in abnormal muscle fibers while immunoblot analysis does not highlight differences in the expression of these proteins also including ZASP protein. Therefore, unlike immunoblot, immunohistochemistry together with light and electron microscopy is a useful diagnostic tool in MFM. Finally three of our 21 patients have missense mutations in the desmin gene, two brothers carry missense mutations in the gene encoding myotilin, one has a missense mutation in alphaB-crystallin, and none harbour pathogenic variations in the genes encoding ZASP and BAG3.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Protein tyrosine phosphatase-like A (PTPLa) has been implicated in skeletal myogenesis and cardiogenesis. Mutations in PTPLa correlated with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia in humans and congenital centronuclear myopathy with severe hypotonia in dogs. The molecular mechanisms of PTPLa in myogenesis are unknown. In this report, we demonstrate that PTPLa is required for myoblast growth and differentiation. The cells lacking PTPLa remained immature and failed to differentiate into mature myotubes. The repressed MyoG expression was responsible for the impaired myoblast differentiation. Meanwhile, impeded cell growth, with an obvious S-phase arrest and compromised G(2)/M transition, was observed in PTPLa-deficient myoblasts. Further study demonstrated that the upregulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E2 complexes, along with a compromised G(2)/M transition due to the decreased CDK1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1) activity and upregulated p21, contributed to the mutant cell S-phase arrest and eventually led to the retarded cell growth. Finally, the transcriptional regulation of the PTPLa gene was explored. We identified PTPLa as a new target gene of the serum response factor (SRF). Skeletal- and cardiac-muscle-specific SRF knockouts resulted in significant decreases in PTPLa expression, suggesting a conserved transcriptional regulation of the PTPLa gene in mice.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by progressive myopathy that is often accompanied by bone weakening and/or frontotemporal dementia. Although it is known to be caused by mutations in the gene encoding valosin-containing protein (VCP), the underlying disease mechanism remains elusive. Like IBMPFD, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder. Neurofibromin, the protein encoded by the NF1 gene, has been shown to regulate synaptogenesis. Here, we show that neurofibromin and VCP interact and work together to control the density of dendritic spines. Certain mutations identified in IBMPFD and NF1 patients reduced the interaction between VCP and neurofibromin and impaired spinogenesis. The functions of neurofibromin and VCP in spinogenesis were shown to correlate with the learning disability and dementia phenotypes seen in patients with IBMPFD. Consistent with the previous finding that treatment with a statin rescues behavioral defects in Nf1(+/-) mice and providing further support for our hypothesis that there is crosstalk between neurofibromin and VCP, statin exposure neutralized the effect of VCP knockdown on spinogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons. The data presented here demonstrate that there is a link between IBMPFD and NF1 and indicate a role for VCP in synapse formation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Infantile myopathies with diaphragmatic paralysis are genetically heterogeneous, and clinical symptoms do not assist in differentiating between them. We used phased haplotype analysis with subsequent targeted exome sequencing to identify MEGF10 mutations in a previously unidentified type of infantile myopathy with diaphragmatic weakness, areflexia, respiratory distress and dysphagia. MEGF10 is highly expressed in activated satellite cells and regulates their proliferation as well as their differentiation and fusion into multinucleated myofibers, which are greatly reduced in muscle from individuals with early onset myopathy, areflexia, respiratory distress and dysphagia.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We have investigated a woman and her daughter with an early onset, slowly progressive myopathy. Muscle biopsy showed in both cases severe atrophy with marked fatty replacement. Frequent fibers with internalized nuclei were present but no typical features of centronuclear myopathy. There were also many fibers with deep invaginations of the plasma membrane. The presence of necklace fibers provided clue to correct genetic diagnosis. Both patients had a novel heterozygous splice site mutation in the myotubularin gene, MTM1 (c.867+1G>T). Analysis of MTM1 cDNA revealed that the mutation resulted in aberrant splicing with variable exon skipping. The expression of normal transcripts was markedly reduced and there was reduced expression of myotubularin protein. Although the expression of the allele without the mutation was reduced we did not obtain evidence of skewed X-chromosome inactivation. Other factors than skewed X-inactivation may cause allele inactivation and manifestation of severe myopathy in heterozygous carriers of pathogenic MTM1 mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The large GTPase dynamin 2 is a key player in membrane and cytoskeletal dynamics mutated in centronuclear myopathy (CNM) and Charcot-Marie Tooth (CMT) neuropathy, two discrete dominant neuromuscular disorders affecting skeletal muscle and peripheral nerves respectively. The molecular basis for the tissue-specific phenotypes observed and the physiopathological mechanisms linked to dynamin 2 mutations are not well established. In this study, we have analyzed the impact of CNM and CMT implicated dynamin 2 mutants using ectopic expression of four CNM and two CMT mutations, and patient fibroblasts harboring two dynamin 2 CNM mutations in established cellular processes of dynamin 2 action. Wild type and CMT mutants were seen in association with microtubules whereas CNM mutants lacked microtubules association and did not disrupt interphase microtubules dynamics. Most dynamin 2 mutants partially decreased clathrin-mediated endocytosis when ectopically expressed in cultured cells; however, experiments in patient fibroblasts suggested that endocytosis is overall not defective. Furthermore, CNM mutants were seen in association with enlarged clathrin stained structures whereas the CMT mutant constructs were associated with clathrin structures that appeared clustered, similar to the structures observed in Dnm1 and Dnm2 double knock-out cells. Other roles of dynamin 2 including its interaction with BIN1 (amphiphysin 2), and its function in Golgi maintenance and centrosome cohesion were not significantly altered. Taken together, these mild functional defects are suggestive of differences between CMT and CNM disease-causing dynamin 2 mutants and suggest that a slight impairment in clathrin-mediated pathways may accumulate over time to foster the respective human diseases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Some pathologic features of the FHL1 myopathies and the myofibrillar myopathies (MFMs) overlap; we therefore searched for mutations in FHL1 in our cohort of 50 patients with genetically undiagnosed MFM. METHODS: Mutations in FHL1 were identified by direct sequencing. Polymorphisms were excluded by using allele-specific PCR in 200 control subjects. Structural changes in muscle were analyzed by histochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and electron microscopy. RESULTS: We detected 2 novel and 1 previously identified missense mutation in 5 patients. Patients 1-4 presented before age 30, display menadione-nitro blue tetrazolium-positive reducing bodies, and harbor mutations in the FHL1 LIM2 domain. Patient 5 presented at age 75 and has no reducing bodies, and his mutation is not in a LIM domain. The clinical features include progressive muscle weakness, hypertrophied muscles, rigid spine, and joint contractures, and 1 patient also has peripheral neuropathy. High-resolution electron microscopy reveals the reducing bodies composed of 13-nm tubulofilaments initially emanating from Z-disks. At a more advanced stage, abundant reducing bodies appear in the cytoplasm and nuclei with concomitant myofibrillar disintegration, accumulation of cytoplasmic degradation products, and aggregation of endoplasmic reticulum and sarcotubular profiles. CONCLUSIONS: FHL1 dystrophies can be associated with MFM pathology. Mutations in the LIM2 domain are associated with reducing bodies composed of distinct tubulofilaments. A mutation extraneous to LIM domains resulted in a mild late-onset phenotype with MFM pathology but no reducing bodies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the Dynamin 2 gene (DNM2) cause autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy or autosomal dominant (AD) Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. Here the authors report one large Czech family with 15 members affected with an AD CMT phenotype of extraordinary variability. Genetic linkage analysis using SNP arrays revealed a locus of about 9.6 Mb on chromosome 19p13.1-13.2. In this critical interval, 373 genes were located. The only gene herein known to be associated with an intermediate type of CMT was Dynamin 2 (DNM2). Subsequent sequence analysis of the DNM2 gene in the index patient revealed a novel missense mutation p.Met580Thr. This missense mutation segregated with the neuropathy, indicating the causal character of this mutation. The phenotype of CMT in this family shows mild to moderate impairment with relatively preserved upper limbs and a very broad range of the onset of clinical symptoms from an early onset around the age of 12 to the late onset during the fifth decade. Electrophysiology showed an intermediate type of peripheral neuropathy. The motor median nerve conduction velocity varied from 36 m/s to normal values with signs of asymmetrical affection of peripheral nerves. No additional symptoms such as cranial nerve involvement, cataract, and signs of neutropenia or myopathy syndrome were observed in any member of the family yet. The progression was slow with no loss of ambulation. The authors suggest that the characterization of clinical variability in a single family may help to direct the genetic analysis directly to the rarely observed DNM2 mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) is a young-adult onset autosomal recessive disorder caused by a hypomorphic rate limiting enzyme of sialic acid biosynthesis. The enzyme is UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase, and is encoded by the GNE gene. HIBM causes slowly progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. Patients are typically diagnosed at 20-30 years of age, and most patients are incapacitated and wheelchair-confined by 30-50 years of age. Some sialic acid containing glycoproteins, including neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), are hyposialylated in HIBM muscle biopsy samples. We developed a method to allow detection of serum NCAM sialylation using Western blot, and tested serum samples from several patients and a HIBM mouse model. Preliminary results showed a clear difference in polysialylated and hyposialylated forms of NCAM extracted from serum, and showed NCAM is hyposialylated in HIBM serum samples. This initial finding may prove useful in reducing the need for serial muscle biopsies in HIBM treatment trials. Additional studies are underway to further validate this finding and to evaluate the specificity, reliability, and robustness of this potential serum biomarker for HIBM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) may involve many target organs with relevant variability among affected individuals. We performed a multi-organ assessment tapping nervous system, skeletal muscle and cardiovascular system in thirty-nine individuals belonging to 16 families from Central Italy sharing the same R1006C CADASIL mutation. Stroke prevalence was larger in female patients (66.7%) than in males (23.8%); high levels of CKemia were quite frequent (21.6%) and were related to a myopathy without mitochondrial alterations; several individuals had atrial septal aneurysm (10.3%). No specific relationships between common cardiovascular risk factors and clinical manifestations were found. The present systematic study thus identified several gender-related, myopathic and cardiovascular peculiarities of R1006C mutation. This kind of comprehensive approach is necessary to define clinical course, prognosis and treatment options for a multi-organ disease such as CADASIL.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene were recently reported to be the cause of 1%-2% of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases. VCP mutations are known to cause inclusion body myopathy (IBM) with Paget's disease (PDB) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The presence of VCP mutations in patients with sporadic ALS, sporadic ALS-FTD, and progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), a known clinical mimic of inclusion body myopathy, is not known. To determine the identity and frequency of VCP mutations we screened a cohort of 93 familial ALS, 754 sporadic ALS, 58 sporadic ALS-FTD, and 264 progressive muscular atrophy patients for mutations in the VCP gene. Two nonsynonymous mutations were detected; 1 known mutation (p.R159H) in a patient with familial ALS with several family members suffering from FTD, and 1 mutation (p.I114V) in a patient with sporadic ALS. Conservation analysis and protein prediction software indicate the p.I114V mutation to be a rare benign polymorphism. VCP mutations are a rare cause of familial ALS. The role of VCP mutations in sporadic ALS, if present, appears limited.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Muscle growth and regeneration are regulated through a series of spatiotemporally dependent signaling and transcriptional cascades. Although the transcriptional program controlling myogenesis has been extensively investigated, the full repertoire of transcriptional regulators involved in this process is far from defined. Various homeodomain transcription factors have been shown to play important roles in both muscle development and muscle satellite cell-dependent repair. Here, we show that the homeodomain factor Barx2 is a new marker for embryonic and adult myoblasts and is required for normal postnatal muscle growth and repair. Barx2 is coexpressed with Pax7, which is the canonical marker of satellite cells, and is upregulated in satellite cells after muscle injury. Mice lacking the Barx2 gene show reduced postnatal muscle growth, muscle atrophy, and defective muscle repair. Moreover, loss of Barx2 delays the expression of genes that control proliferation and differentiation in regenerating muscle. Consistent with the in vivo observations, satellite cell-derived myoblasts cultured from Barx2(-/-) mice show decreased proliferation and ability to differentiate relative to those from wild-type or Barx2(+/-) mice. Barx2(-/-) myoblasts show reduced expression of the differentiation-associated factor myogenin as well as cell adhesion and matrix molecules. Finally, we find that mice lacking both Barx2 and dystrophin gene expression have severe early onset myopathy. Together, these data indicate that Barx2 is an important regulator of muscle growth and repair that acts via the control of satellite cell proliferation and differentiation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked myotubular myopathy (MTM) is a severe neuromuscular disease of infancy caused by mutations of MTM1, which encodes the phosphoinositide lipid phosphatase, myotubularin. The Mtm1 knockout (KO) mouse has a severe phenotype and its short lifespan (8 weeks) makes it a challenge to use as a model in the testing of certain preclinical therapeutics. Many MTM patients succumb early in life, but some have a more favorable prognosis. We used human genotype-phenotype correlation data to develop a myotubularin-deficient mouse model with a less severe phenotype than is seen in Mtm1 KO mice. We modeled the human c.205C>T point mutation in Mtm1 exon 4, which is predicted to introduce the p.R69C missense change in myotubularin. Hemizygous male Mtm1 p.R69C mice develop early muscle atrophy prior to the onset of weakness at 2 months. The median survival period is 66 weeks. Histopathology shows small myofibers with centrally placed nuclei. Myotubularin protein is undetectably low because the introduced c.205C>T base change induced exon 4 skipping in most mRNAs, leading to premature termination of myotubularin translation. Some full-length Mtm1 mRNA bearing the mutation is present, which provides enough myotubularin activity to account for the relatively mild phenotype, as Mtm1 KO and Mtm1 p.R69C mice have similar muscle phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate levels. These data explain the basis for phenotypic variability among human patients with MTM1 p.R69C mutations and establish the Mtm1 p.R69C mouse as a valuable model for the disease, as its less severe phenotype will expand the scope of testable preclinical therapies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathy, the most common congenital myopathy, is caused by mutations in genes encoding thin filament and thin filament-associated proteins in skeletal muscles. Severely affected patients fail to survive beyond the first year of life due to severe muscle weakness. There are no specific therapies to combat this muscle weakness. We have generated the first knock-in mouse model for severe nemaline myopathy by replacing a normal allele of the α-skeletal actin gene with a mutated form (H40Y), which causes severe nemaline myopathy in humans. The Acta1(H40Y) mouse has severe muscle weakness manifested as shortened lifespan, significant forearm and isolated muscle weakness and decreased mobility. Muscle pathologies present in the human patients (e.g. nemaline rods, fibre atrophy and increase in slow fibres) were detected in the Acta1(H40Y) mouse, indicating that it is an excellent model for severe nemaline myopathy. Mating of the Acta1(H40Y) mouse with hypertrophic four and a half LIM domains protein 1 and insulin-like growth factor-1 transgenic mice models increased forearm strength and mobility, and decreased nemaline pathologies. Dietary L-tyrosine supplements also alleviated the mobility deficit and decreased the chronic repair and nemaline rod pathologies. These results suggest that L-tyrosine may be an effective treatment for muscle weakness and immobility in nemaline myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Four-and-a-half LIM domain protein 1 isoform A (FHL1A) is predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Mutations in the FHL1 gene are causative for several types of hereditary myopathies including X-linked myopathy with postural muscle atrophy (XMPMA). We here studied myoblasts from XMPMA patients. We found that functional FHL1A protein is completely absent in patient myoblasts. In parallel, expression of FHL1C is either unaffected or increased. Furthermore, a decreased proliferation rate of XMPMA myoblasts compared to controls was observed but an increased number of XMPMA myoblasts was found in the G(0)/G(1) phase. Furthermore, low expression of K(v1.5), a voltage-gated potassium channel known to alter myoblast proliferation during the G(1) phase and to control repolarization of action potential, was detected. In order to substantiate a possible relation between K(v1.5) and FHL1C, a pull-down assay was performed. A physical and direct interaction of both proteins was observed in vitro. In addition, confocal microscopy revealed substantial colocalization of FHL1C and K(v1.5) within atrial cells, supporting a possible interaction between both proteins in vivo. Two-electrode voltage clamp experiments demonstrated that coexpression of K(v1.5) with FHL1C in Xenopus laevis oocytes markedly reduced K(+) currents when compared to oocytes expressing K(v1.5) only. We here present the first evidence on a biological relevance of FHL1C.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene are known to cause inclusion body myopathy with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Despite an increasing number of clinical reports, only one Asian family with IBMPFD has been described. METHODS: To characterize patients with VCP mutations, we screened a total of 152 unrelated Asian families who were suspected to have rimmed vacuolar myopathy. RESULTS: We identified VCP mutations in seven patients from six unrelated Asian families. Five different missense mutations were found, including a novel p.Ala439Pro substitution. All patients had adult-onset progressive muscle wasting with variable involvement of axial, proximal, and distal muscles. Two of seven patients were suggested to have mild brain involvement including cerebellar ataxia, and only one showed radiological findings indicating a change in bone. Findings from skeletal muscle indicated mixed neurogenic and myogenic changes, fibers with rimmed vacuoles, and the presence of cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions. These inclusions were immunopositive for VCP, ubiquitin, transactivation response DNA-binding protein 43, and also histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), of which function is regulated by VCP. Evidence of early nuclear and mitochondrial damage was also characteristic. CONCLUSIONS:   Valosin-containing protein mutations are not rare in Asian patients, and gene analysis should be considered for patients with adult-onset rimmed vacuolar myopathy with neurogenic changes. A wide variety of central and peripheral nervous system symptoms coupled with rare bone abnormalities may complicate diagnosis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Recent data from clinical and mammalian genetic studies indicate that COL4A1 mutations manifest with basement membrane defects that result in muscle weakness, cramps, contractures, dystrophy and atrophy. In-depth studies of mutant COL4A1-associated muscle phenotype, however, are lacking and significant details of the muscle-specific pathomechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we have used a comprehensive set of Drosophila col4a1 and col4a2 mutants and a series of genetic and mutational analyses, gene, protein expression, and immunohistochemistry experiments in order to establish a Drosophila model and address some of these questions. The Drosophila genome contains two type IV collagen genes, col4a1 and col4a2. Mutant heterozygotes of either gene are viable and fertile, whereas homozygotes are lethal. In complementation analysis of all known mutants of the locus and a complementation matrix derived from these data we have identified the dominant lesions within the col4a1, but not within the col4a2 gene. Expression of a col4a1 transgene partially rescued the dominant and recessive mutant col4a1 alleles but not the col4a2 mutations that were all recessive. Partial complementation suggested that col4a1 gene mutations have strong antimorph effect likely due to the incorporation of the mutant protein into the triple helix. In col4a1 mutants, morphological changes of the oviduct muscle included severe myopathy with centronuclear myofibers leading to gradual development of female sterility. In larval body wall muscles ultrastructural changes included disturbance of A and I bands between persisting Z bands. In the most severely affected DTS-L3 mutant, we have identified four missense mutations within the coding region of the col4a1 gene two of which affected the Y within the Gly-X-Y unit and a 3' UTR point mutation. In conclusion, our Drosophila mutant series may serve as an effective model to uncover the mechanisms by which COL4A1 mutations result in compromised myofiber-basement membrane interactions and aberrant muscle function.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Congenital myopathies are early onset hereditary muscle disorders. A sub-group of these is associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. Mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene have been associated with various congenital myopathy phenotypes and may also cause malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. We describe nine affected members of an extended family presenting with a myopathy typically manifesting as upper eye lid ptosis, quadriceps atrophy and patellar dislocation. Three affected members underwent extensive genetic testing and have a RYR1 exon 46 c.7354C>T gene mutation; two of whom had muscle biopsies--both demonstrated central core myopathy. The only affected family member who underwent testing for malignant hyperthermia susceptibility was shown to be positive. The clinical phenotypes seen among affected family members varies widely in severity, and have features in common with those congenital myopathies associated with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, raising the possibility that these conditions represent a spectrum of disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mitochondrial dysfunction is an important cause of metabolic disorders of children and adults, with no effective therapy options. Recently, induction of mitochondrial biogenesis, by transgenic overexpression of PGC1-alpha [peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma coactivator 1-alpha], was reported to delay progression of early-onset cytochrome-c-oxidase (COX) deficiency in skeletal muscle of two mouse models: a muscle-specific knock-out of COX10 (COX10-mKO) and a constitutive knock-out of Surf1 (Surf1-KO). A pan-PPAR agonist, bezafibrate, could similarly delay myopathy progression in COX10-mKOs, but not in SURF1-KOs. We asked whether bezafibrate affected disease progression in late-onset adult-type mitochondrial myopathy mice. These 'Deletor mice' express a dominant patient mutation in Twinkle-helicase, leading to accumulation of multiple mtDNA deletions and subsequent progressive respiratory chain (RC) deficiency with COX-negative muscle fibers at 12 months of age. The primary and secondary molecular findings in Deletor mice mimic closely those in patients with Twinkle myopathy. We applied 0.5% bezafibrate diet to Deletors for 22 weeks, starting at disease manifestation, mimicking patient treatment after diagnosis. Bezafibrate delayed significantly the accumulation of COX-negative fibers and multiple mtDNA deletions. However, mitochondrial biogenesis was not induced: mitochondrial DNA copy number, transcript and RC protein amounts decreased in both Deletors and wild-type mice. Furthermore, bezafibrate induced severe lipid oxidation effects, with hepatomegaly and loss of adipose tissue, the mechanism involving lipid mobilization by high hepatic expression of FGF21 cytokine. However, as bezafibrate has been tolerated well by humans, the beneficial muscle findings in Deletor mice support consideration of bezafibrate trials on adult patients with mitochondrial myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the type VI collagen gene ( COL6A1) cause myopathy and muscle weakness. In addition, COL6A1 knockout mice were shown to have impaired running performance and reduced muscle strength. The COL6A1 rs35796750 polymorphism (IVS32-29 T/C) has been associated with complex phenotypes. The aim of this study was therefore to determine if this polymorphism is associated with performance during the 226 km Ironman triathlon. Participants (n=661) were recruited during 4 South African Ironman triathlons. Finishing times for the 3.8 km swim, 180 km bike, 42.2 km run, and overall race were provided by the race organisers. All participants were genotyped for the COL6A1 rs35796750 polymorphism. Participants with the COL6A1 TT genotype were significantly faster during the bike (p=0.014) and overall race (p=0.030). When participants were grouped into fast, middle and slow bike finishing time tertiles, there was a significant linear trend for the TT genotype (Fast: TT=35.7%; Middle: TT=29.0%; Slow: TT=23.8%; p=0.008). No significant genotype frequency differences were observed for the swim or run of the triathlon. In conclusion, the COL6A1 gene is therefore a potential marker for endurance cycling performance. These effects may be mediated through changes to the composition of type VI collagen containing tissues, such as muscle and tendon.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Recent studies reported the association between SLCO1B1 polymorphisms and the development of statin-induced myopathy. In the scenario of the Brazilian population, being one of the most heterogeneous in the world, the main aim here was to evaluate SLCO1B1 polymorphisms according to ethnic groups as an initial step for future pharmacogenetic studies. METHODS: One hundred and eighty-two Amerindians plus 1,032 subjects from the general urban population were included. Genotypes for the SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (c.T521C, p.V174A, exon 5) and SLCO1B1 rs4363657 (g.T89595C, intron 11) polymorphisms were detected by polymerase chain reaction followed by high resolution melting analysis with the Rotor Gene 6000® instrument. RESULTS: The frequencies of the SLCO1B1 rs4149056 and rs4363657 C variant allele were higher in Amerindians (28.3% and 26.1%) and were lower in African descent subjects (5.7% and 10.8%) compared with Mulatto (14.9% and 18.2%) and Caucasian descent (14.8% and 15.4%) ethnic groups (p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.001, respectively). Linkage disequilibrium analysis show that these variant alleles are in different linkage disequilibrium patterns depending on the ethnic origin. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate interethnic differences for the SLCO1B1 rs4149056 C risk allele frequency among Brazilians. These data will be useful in the development of effective programs for stratifying individuals regarding adherence, efficacy and choice of statin-type.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>VCP/p97 is a multifunctional AAA+-ATPase involved in vesicle fusion, proteasomal degradation, and autophagy. Reported dysfunctions of these processes in Alzheimer disease (AD), along with the linkage of VCP/p97 to inclusion body myopathy with Paget's disease and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) led us to examine the possible linkage of VCP to the AD-relevant protein, tau. VCP levels were reduced in AD brains, but not in the cerebral cortex of an AD mouse model, suggesting that VCP reduction occurs upstream of tau pathology. Genetic reduction of VCP in a primary neuronal model led to increases in the levels of tau phosphorylated at Ser(262/356), indicating that VCP may be involved in regulating post-translational processing of tau in AD, demonstrating a possible functional linkage between tau and VCP.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The genetic basis of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a short expansion of a polyalanine tract (normal allele: 10 alanines, mutant allele: 11-17 alanines) in the nuclear polyadenylate binding protein PABPN1 which is essential for controlling poly(A) tail length in messenger RNA. Mutant PABPN1 forms nuclear inclusions in OPMD muscle. To investigate the pathogenic role of mutant PABPN1 in vivo, we generated a ligand-inducible transgenic mouse model by using the mifepristone-inducible gene expression system. Induction of ubiquitous expression of mutant PABPN1 resulted in skeletal and cardiac myopathy. Histological changes of degenerative myopathy were preceded by nuclear inclusions of insoluble PABPN1. Downregulation of mutant PABPN1 expression attenuated the myopathy and reduced the nuclear burden of insoluble PABPN1. These results support association between mutant PABPN1 accumulation and degenerative myopathy in mice. Resolution of myopathy in mice suggests that the disease process in OPMD patients may be treatable.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Skeletal muscle myopathy is a common diabetes complication. One possible cause of myopathy is myocyte failure to repair contraction-generated plasma membrane injuries. Here, we test the hypothesis that diabetes induces a repair defect in skeletal muscle myocytes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Myocytes in intact muscle from type 1 (INS2(Akita+/-)) and type 2 (db/db) diabetic mice were injured with a laser and dye uptake imaged confocally to test repair efficiency. Membrane repair defects were also assessed in diabetic mice after downhill running, which induces myocyte plasma membrane disruption injuries in vivo. A cell culture model was used to investigate the role of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and the receptor for AGE (RAGE) in development of this repair defect. RESULTS: Diabetic myocytes displayed significantly more dye influx after laser injury than controls, indicating a repair deficiency. Downhill running also resulted in a higher level of repair failure in diabetic mice. This repair defect was mimicked in cultured cells by prolonged exposure to high glucose. Inhibition of the formation of AGE eliminated this glucose-induced repair defect. However, a repair defect could be induced, in the absence of high glucose, by enhancing AGE binding to RAGE, or simply by increasing cell exposure to AGE. CONCLUSIONS: Because one consequence of repair failure is rapid cell death (via necrosis), our demonstration that repair fails in diabetes suggests a new mechanism by which myopathy develops in diabetes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Ryanodine receptor 1 (RyR1) is a Ca(2+) release channel located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane of skeletal muscle. More than 200 variants in RyR1 have been identified in DNA from patients with malignant hyperthermia (MH) and congenital myopathies; only 30 have been sufficiently studied so as to be identified as MH-causative mutations. The Ala4894Thr RyR1 variant was found in a Japanese patient with susceptibility to MH, and the Ala4894Pro variant in a rare case of myopathy: congenital neuromuscular disease with uniform type 1 fiber (CNMDU1). We hypothesized that different Ala4894 variants of RyR1 cause different pathophysiological changes that are identifiable by having differing pharmacological sensitivities to RYR1 agonists. METHODS: Expression vector with a mutation in RYR1 corresponding to the Ala4894Thr, Ala4894Pro, Ala4894Ser, or Ala 4894Gly variant of human RyR1 was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. At 72 hours after transfection, we determined the intracellular Ca(2+) changes induced by caffeine and 4-chloro-m-cresol (4CmC), in the presence or absence of dantrolene. RESULTS: Ala4894Thr-transfected cells and Ala4894Ser-transfected cells were more sensitive to caffeine than the wild type, and Ala4894Thr-transfected cells were also more sensitive to 4CmC than the wild type, whereas Ala4894Pro-transfected cells had no response to caffeine or 4CmC. Ala4894Gly-transfected cells were significantly less sensitive to caffeine than the wild type. In addition, the responses of Ala4894Thr-transfected cells and Ala4894Ser-transfected cells to caffeine were suppressed by dantrolene. CONCLUSION: We concluded that different Ala4894 variants of RyR1 lead to different agonist/antagonist sensitivities, which may predict differing RYR1 functionality during excitation-contraction coupling and sensitivity to MH. The hypersensitive Ala4894Thr-RyR1 is associated with MH and the poorly functional Ala4894Pro-RyR1 with CNMDU1.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Primary carnitine deficiency is caused by defective OCTN2 carnitine transporters encoded by the SLC22A5 gene. Lack of carnitine impairs fatty acid oxidation resulting in hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, skeletal and cardiac myopathy. Recently, asymptomatic mothers with primary carnitine deficiency were identified by low carnitine levels in their infant by newborn screening. Here, we evaluate mutations in the SLC22A5 gene and carnitine transport in fibroblasts from symptomatic patients and asymptomatic women. Carnitine transport was significantly reduced in fibroblasts obtained from all patients with primary carnitine deficiency, but was significantly higher in the asymptomatic women's than in the symptomatic patients' fibroblasts (P &lt; 0.01). By contrast, ergothioneine transport (a selective substrate of the OCTN1 transporter, tested here as a control) was similar in cells from controls and patients with carnitine deficiency. DNA sequencing indicated an increased frequency of nonsense mutations in symptomatic patients (P &lt; 0.001). Expression of the missense mutations in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells indicated that many mutations retained residual carnitine transport activity, with no difference in the average activity of missense mutations identified in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients. These results indicate that cells from asymptomatic women have on average higher levels of residual carnitine transport activity as compared to that of symptomatic patients due to the presence of at least one missense mutation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the CRYAB gene, encoding alpha-B crystallin, cause distinct clinical phenotypes including isolated posterior polar cataract, myofibrillar myopathy, cardiomyopathy, or a multisystemic disorder combining all these features. Genotype/phenotype correlations are still unclear. To date, multisystemic involvement has been reported only in kindred harboring the R120G substitution. We report a novel CRYAB mutation, D109H, associated with posterior polar cataract, myofibrillar myopathy and cardiomyopathy in a two-generation family with five affected individuals. Age of onset, clinical presentation, and muscle abnormalities were very similar to those described in the R120G family. Alpha-B crystallin may form dimers and acts as a chaperone for a number of proteins. It has been suggested that the phenotypic diversity could be related to the various interactions between target proteins of individual mutant residues. Molecular modeling indicates that residues D109 and R120 interact with each other during dimerization of alpha-B crystallin; interestingly, the two substitutions affecting these residues (D109H and R120G) are associated with the same clinical phenotype, thus suggesting a similar pathogenic mechanism. We propose that impairment of alpha-B crystallin dimerization may also be relevant to the pathogenesis of these disorders.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the valosin-containing protein gene (VCP) have been identified in neurological disorders (inclusion body myopathy--early Paget's disease of the bone--frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and are thought to play a role in the clearance of abnormally folded proteins. Parkinsonism has been noted in kindreds with VCP mutations. Based on this, we hypothesized that mutations in VCP may also contribute to idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). We screened the coding region of the VCP gene in a large cohort of 768 late-onset PD cases (average age at onset, 70 years), both sporadic and with positive family history. We identified a number of rare single nucleotide changes, including a variant previously described to be pathogenic, but no clear disease-causing variants. We conclude that mutations in VCP are not a common cause for idiopathic PD.</rdfs:comment>

In addition to the three previously described human GNE isoforms (hGNE1-hGNE3), our database and polymerase chain reaction analysis yielded five additional human isoforms (hGNE4-hGNE8). hGNE1 is the ubiquitously expressed major isoform, while the hGNE2-hGNE8 isoforms are differentially expressed and may act as tissue-specific regulators of sialylation. hGNE2 and hGNE7 display a 31-residue N-terminal extension compared to hGNE1. On the basis of similarities to kinases and helicases, this extension does not seem to hinder the epimerase enzymatic active site. hGNE3 and hGNE8 contain a 55-residue N-terminal deletion and a 50-residue N-terminal extension compared to hGNE1. The size and secondary structures of these fragments are similar, and modeling predicted that these modifications do not affect the overall fold compared to that of hGNE1. However, the epimerase enzymatic activity of GNE3 and GNE8 is likely absent, because the deleted fragment contains important substrate binding residues in homologous bacterial epimerases. hGNE5-hGNE8 have a 53-residue deletion, which was assigned a role in substrate (UDP-GlcNAc) binding. Deletion of this fragment likely eliminates epimerase enzymatic activity. Our findings imply that GNE is subject to evolutionary mechanisms to improve cellular functions, without increasing the number of genes. Our expression and modeling data contribute to elucidation of the complex functional and regulatory mechanisms of human GNE and may contribute to further elucidating the pathology and treatment strategies of the human GNE-opathies sialuria and hereditary inclusion body myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mice deficient in α-sarcoglycan (Sgca-null mice) develop progressive muscular dystrophy and serve as a model for human limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2D. Sgca-null mice suffer a more severe myopathy than that of mdx mice, the model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This is the opposite of what is observed in humans and the reason for this is unknown. In an attempt to understand the cellular basis of this severe muscular dystrophy, we isolated clonal populations of myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs), the resident postnatal muscle progenitors of dystrophic and wild-type mice. MPCs from Sgca-null mice generated much smaller clones than MPCs from wild-type or mdx dystrophic mice. Impaired proliferation of Sgca-null myogenic precursors was confirmed by single fiber analysis and this difference correlated with Sgca expression during MPC proliferation. In the absence of dystrophin and associated proteins, which are only expressed after differentiation, SGCA complexes with and stabilizes FGFR1. Deficiency of Sgca leads to an absence of FGFR1 expression at the membrane and impaired MPC proliferation in response to bFGF. The low proliferation rate of Sgca-null MPCs was rescued by transduction with Sgca-expressing lentiviral vectors. When transplanted into dystrophic muscle, Sgca-null MPCs exhibited reduced engraftment. The reduced proliferative ability of Sgca-null MPCs explains, at least in part, the severity of this muscular dystrophy and also why wild-type donor progenitor cells engraft efficiently and consequently ameliorate disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by dilation of left ventricular cavity with systolic dysfunction. Clinical symptom of DCM is heart failure, often associated with cardiac sudden death. About 20-35% of DCM patients have apparent family histories and it has been revealed that mutations in genes for sarcomere proteins cause DCM. However, the disease-causing mutations can be found only in about 17% of Japanese patients with familial DCM. Bcl-2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) is a co-chaperone protein with antiapoptotic function, which localizes at Z-disc in the striated muscles. Recently, BAG3 gene mutations in DCM patients were reported, but the functional abnormalities caused by the mutations are not fully unraveled. In this study, we analyzed 72 Japanese familial DCM patients for mutations in BAG3 and found two mutations, p.Arg218Trp and p.Leu462Pro, in two cases of adult-onset DCM without skeletal myopathy, which were absent from 400 control subjects. Functional studies at the cellular level revealed that the DCM-associated BAG3 mutations impaired the Z-disc assembly and increased the sensitivities to stress-induced apoptosis. These observations suggested that BAG3 mutations present in 2.8% of Japanese familial DCM patients caused DCM possibly by interfering with Z-disc assembly and inducing apoptotic cell death under the metabolic stress.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the gene encoding dysferlin cause two distinct muscular dystrophy phenotypes: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD-2B) and Miyoshi myopathy (MM). Dysferlin is a large transmembrane protein involved in myoblast fusion and membrane resealing. Zebrafish represent an ideal animal model to use for studying muscle disease including abnormalities of dysferlin. cDNAs of zebrafish dysferlin were cloned (6.3 kb) and the predicted amino acid sequences, showed 68% similarity to predicted amino acid sequences of mammalian dysferlin. The expression of dysferlin was mainly in skeletal muscle, heart and eye, and the expression could be detected as early as 11h post fertilization (hpf). Three different antisense oligonucleotide morpholinos were targeted to inhibit translation of this dysferlin mRNA and the morpholino-injected fish showed marked muscle disorganization which could be detected by birefringence assay. Western blot analysis using dysferlin antibodies showed that the expression of dysferlin was reduced in each of the three morphants. Dysferlin expression was shown to be reduced at the myosepta of zebrafish muscle using immunohistochemistry, although the expression of other muscle membrane components, dystrophin, laminin, β-dystroglycan were detected normally. Our data suggest that zebrafish dysferlin expression is involved in stabilizing muscle structures and its downregulation causes muscle disorganization.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the POLG gene have emerged as one of the most common causes of inherited mitochondrial diseases in children and adults. This study sequenced the exons and flanking intronic regions of the POLG gene from 2697 unrelated patients with clinical presentations suggestive of POLG deficiency. Informative mutations have been identified in 136 unrelated individuals (5%), including 92 patients with two recessive pathogenic alleles and three patients harbouring a dominant mutation. Twenty-four novel recessive mutations and a novel possible dominant mutation, p.Y951N, were identified. All missense mutations occurred at evolutionarily conserved amino acids within functionally important regions identified by molecular modelling analyses. Oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridisation analyses performed on DNA samples from 81 patients with one mutant POLG allele identified a large intragenic deletion in only one patient, suggesting that large deletions in POLG are rare. The 92 patients with two mutant alleles exhibited a broad spectrum of disease. Almost all patients in all age groups had some degree of neuropathy. Seizures, hepatopathy, and lactic acidaemia were predominant in younger patients. By comparison, patients who developed symptoms in adulthood had a higher percentage of myopathy, sensory ataxia, and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO)/ptosis. In conclusion, POLG mutations account for a broad clinical spectrum of mitochondrial disorders. Sequence analysis of the POLG gene should be considered as a part of routine screening for mitochondrial disorders, even in the absence of apparent mitochondrial DNA abnormalities.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To investigate GNE gene mutations in 5 Chinese patients with distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV). METHODS: Five patients with typical clinical and pathological features of DMRV were studied. All the 11 coding exons and the flanking intron sequences of GNE gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Four family members of case 5 were also examined for GNE gene mutations. RESULTS: All the patients were identified to have different GNE gene mutations: Cases 1-4 had complex heterozygous mutations and case 5 had homozygous mutation. Six reported mutations had been identified, including 1 nonsense mutation (p.R8X) and 5 missense mutations (p.D176V, p.I298T, p.A591T, P.A631V, and p.V696M). A novel mutation (c.317T>C, p.I106T) was identified in case 2. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of p.R8X, p.I298T, p.A591T and p.V696M mutations in GNE gene in Chinese population, and a novel mutation p.I106T was identified. These findings further expand the clinical and genetic spectrum of DMRV in China.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Selenium is an essential trace element and selenoprotein N (SelN) was the first selenium-containing protein shown to be directly involved in human inherited diseases. Mutations in the SEPN1 gene, encoding SelN, cause a group of muscular disorders characterized by predominant affection of axial muscles. SelN has been shown to participate in calcium and redox homeostasis, but its pathophysiological role in skeletal muscle remains largely unknown. To address SelN function in vivo, we generated a Sepn1-null mouse model by gene targeting. The Sepn1(-/-) mice had normal growth and lifespan, and were macroscopically indistinguishable from wild-type littermates. Only minor defects were observed in muscle morphology and contractile properties in SelN-deficient mice in basal conditions. However, when subjected to challenging physical exercise and stress conditions (forced swimming test), Sepn1(-/-) mice developed an obvious phenotype, characterized by limited motility and body rigidity during the swimming session, as well as a progressive curvature of the spine and predominant alteration of paravertebral muscles. This induced phenotype recapitulates the distribution of muscle involvement in patients with SEPN1-Related Myopathy, hence positioning this new animal model as a valuable tool to dissect the role of SelN in muscle function and to characterize the pathophysiological process.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The c.1550g→t mutation in the POLG gene causing the G517V substitution has been reported by many groups to be associated with a variety of mitochondrial diseases, including autosomal dominant and recessive forms of ataxia neuropathy, myopathy and microcephaly, progressive external ophthalmoplegia, diabetes, strokes, hypotonia, and epilepsy. However, the variable disease presentation and age of onset raises suspicion of its pathogenicity. Because of the varied reported associated symptoms and request from physicians to address the consequence of this mutation, we have carried out the biochemical analysis of the purified recombinant human DNA polymerase γ protein harboring the G517V substitution. These analyses revealed that the G517V mutant enzyme retained 80-90% of wild-type DNA polymerase activity, in addition to its functional interaction with the p55 accessory subunit. DNA binding by the mutant was also only slightly lower than the wild-type enzyme. Our data suggest that the G517V mutation by itself in pol γ most likely does not have a role in mitochondrial disorders.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Heat shock proteins are important factors in skeletal muscle physiology and stress response. We examined the effects of chronic inflammation on the distribution of heat shock protein families 70 and 90 using immunofluorescence and Western blotting, in muscle biopsies from 33 idiopathic inflammatory myopathy patients [aged 26-66 (dermatomyositis), 17-78 (polymyositis) and 57-80 (sporadic inclusion body myositis) years], and seven Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients (aged 3-19 years). Our results reveal the multifaceted role played by chaperones in inflammatory muscle tissue. On the one hand, regenerating, atrophic and vacuolated muscle fibers displayed upregulation of both protein families. Higher levels of chaperones in challenged fibers point to the myocyte's attempt to restore and regenerate. On the other hand, heat shock proteins of the 90 family were strongly upregulated in macrophages and cytotoxic T-cells actively invading nonnecrotic muscle fibers of sporadic inclusion body myositis and polymyositis, probably conferring enhanced myocytotoxic capacity. Our data provide positive arguments for exploring heat shock protein 90-based therapy in inflammatory muscle disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The mutation pattern of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in mainland Chinese patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) has been rarely reported, though previous data suggested that the mutation pattern of MELAS could be different among geographically localized populations. We presented the results of comprehensive mtDNA mutation analysis in 92 unrelated Chinese patients with MELAS (85 with classic MELAS and 7 with MELAS/Leigh syndrome (LS) overlap syndrome). The mtDNA A3243G mutation was the most common causal genotype in this patient group (79/92 and 85.9%). The second common gene mutation was G13513A (7/92 and 7.6%). Additionally, we identified T10191C (p.S45P) in ND3, A11470C (p. K237N) in ND4, T13046C (p.M237T) in ND5 and a large-scale deletion (13025-13033:14417-14425) involving partial ND5 and ND6 subunits of complex I in one patient each. Among them, A11470C, T13046C and the single deletion were novel mutations. In summary, patients with mutations affecting mitochondrially encoded complex I (MTND) reached 12.0% (11/92) in this group. It is noteworthy that all seven patients with MELAS/LS overlap syndrome were associated with MTND mutations. Our data emphasize the important role of MTND mutations in the pathogenicity of MELAS, especially MELAS/LS overlap syndrome.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Several desmin mutations have been described in patients with cardiomyopathies and distal myopathies. Among them, A213V substitution has been associated with three completely different clinical phenotypes: restrictive cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy and isolated distal myopathy. However, the identification of this substitution also in control subjects has highlighted the question if the A213V shift represents a conditional mutation, giving rise to cardiomyopathy only in the presence of other predisposing factors. The aim of the present work was to study the potential role of this substitution in predisposing to heart dilation. Methods and results. We screened 108 patients with heart dilation due to ischemic heart disease, alcoholic cardiomyopathy or viral myocarditis, and 300 healthy controls for the presence of A213V substitution by direct sequencing and confirmed the results by site-specific restriction. In the control group A213V substitution was identified in 3 out of 300 patients, representing a rare polymorphism with a frequency of approximately 1%, which corresponds to the earlier reported frequency. In the study group A213V substitution was found in 5 out of 108 cases, corresponding to approximately 4.6% (p &lt; 0.035). Therefore we conclude that A213V desmin substitution represents a conditional mutation, i.e. a rare polymorphism that plays a role as a predisposing factor resulting in maladaptive heart remodelling in the presence of other pathological factors.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We examined the effects of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) on the initiation of atherosclerosis. ATGL was recently identified as a rate-limiting triglyceride (TG) lipase. Mutations in the human ATGL gene are associated with neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy, a rare genetic disease characterized by excessive accumulation of TG in multiple tissues. The cardiac phenotype, known as triglyceride deposit cardiomyovasculopathy, shows massive TG accumulation in both coronary atherosclerotic lesions and the myocardium. Recent reports show that myocardial triglyceride content is significantly higher in patients with prediabetes or diabetes and that ATGL expression is decreased in the obese insulin-resistant state. Therefore, we investigated the effect of decreased ATGL activity on the development of atherosclerosis using human aortic endothelial cells. We found that ATGL knockdown enhanced monocyte adhesion via increased expression of TNFα-induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Next, we determined the pathways (MAPK, PKC, or NFκB) involved in ICAM-1 up-regulation induced by ATGL knockdown. Both phosphorylation of PKC and degradation of IκBα were increased in ATGL knockdown human aortic endothelial cells. In addition, intracellular diacylglycerol levels and free fatty acid uptake via CD36 were significantly increased in these cells. Inhibition of the PKC pathway using calphostin C and GF109203X suppressed TNFα-induced ICAM-1 expression. In conclusion, we showed that ATGL knockdown increased monocyte adhesion to the endothelium through enhanced TNFα-induced ICAM-1 expression via activation of NFκB and PKC. These results suggest that reduced ATGL expression may influence the atherogenic process in neutral lipid storage diseases and in the insulin-resistant state.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>INTRODUCTION: Of the nearly 38 million people in the USA who receive statin therapy, 0.1-0.5% experience severe or life-threatening myopathic side effects. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a group of patients with severe statin myopathy versus a statin-tolerant group to identify genetic susceptibility loci. RESULTS: Replication studies in independent groups of severe statin myopathy (n = 190) and statin-tolerant controls (n = 130) resulted in the identification of three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs9342288, rs1337512, and rs3857532, in the eyes shut homolog (EYS) on chromosome 6 suggestive of an association with risk for severe statin myopathy (P = 0.0003-0.0008). Analysis of EYS cDNA demonstrated that EYS gene products are complex and expressed with relative abundance in the spinal cord as well as in the retina. CONCLUSION: Structural similarities of these EYS gene products to members of the Notch signaling pathway and to agrin suggest a possible functional role in the maintenance and regeneration of the structural integrity of skeletal muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Central core disease (CCD) is a congenital human myopathy associated with mutations in the gene encoding the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1), resulting in skeletal muscle weakness and lower limb deformities. The muscle weakness can be at least partially explained by a reduced magnitude of voltage-gated Ca(2+) release (VGCR). To date, only a few studies have focused on identifying potential therapeutic agents for CCD. Therefore, in this work we investigated the potential use of the calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) to restore VGCR in myotubes expressing CCD RyR1 mutants. We also examined the influence of CCD mutants on Ca(2+)-dependent processes involved in myogenesis (myoblast fusion and sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase isoform 2 (SERCA2) gene expression). C2C12 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding either wild-type RyR1 or CCD mutants, and then exposed to CGRP (100 nm, 1-4 h). Expression of the I4897T mutant significantly inhibited SERCA2 gene expression and myoblast fusion, whereas the Y523S mutant exerted the opposite effect. Interestingly, both mutants clearly inhibited VGCR (50%), due to a reduction in SR Ca(2+) content. However, no major changes due to CGRP or CCD mutants were observed in I(CaL). Our data suggest that the Y523S mutant results in store depletion via decompensated SR Ca(2+) leak, while the I4897T mutant inhibits SERCA2 gene expression. Remarkably, in both cases CGRP restored VGCR, likely to have been by enhancing phospholamban (PLB) phosphorylation, SERCA activity and SR Ca(2+) content. Taken together, our data show that in the C2C12 model system, changes in excitation-contraction coupling induced by the expression of RyR1 channels bearing CCD mutations Y523S or I4897T can be reversed by CGRP.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked myopathy resulting from the production of a nonfunctional dystrophin protein. MicroRNA (miRNA) are small 21-to 24-nucleotide RNA that can regulate both individual genes and entire cell signaling pathways. Previously, we identified several mRNA, both muscle-enriched and inflammation-induced, that are dysregulated in the skeletal muscles of DMD patients. One particularly muscle-enriched miRNA, miR-486, is significantly downregulated in dystrophin-deficient mouse and human skeletal muscles. miR-486 is embedded within the ANKYRIN1(ANK1) gene locus, which is transcribed as either a long (erythroid-enriched) or a short (heart muscle- and skeletal muscle-enriched) isoform, depending on the cell and tissue types. RESULTS: Inhibition of miR-486 in normal muscle myoblasts results in inhibited migration and failure to repair a wound in primary myoblast cell cultures. Conversely, overexpression of miR-486 in primary myoblast cell cultures results in increased proliferation with no changes in cellular apoptosis. Using bioinformatics and miRNA reporter assays, we have identified platelet-derived growth factor receptor β, along with several other downstream targets of the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10/AKT (PTEN/AKT) pathway, as being modulated by miR-486. The generation of muscle-specific transgenic mice that overexpress miR-486 revealed that miR-486 alters the cell cycle kinetics of regenerated myofibers in vivo, as these mice had impaired muscle regeneration. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate a link for miR-486 as a regulator of the PTEN/AKT pathway in dystrophin-deficient muscle and an important factor in the regulation of DMD muscle pathology.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, is a common and lethal form of muscular dystrophy. With progressive disease, most patients succumb to death from respiratory or heart failure, or both. However, the mechanisms, especially those governing cardiac inflammation and fibrosis in DMD, remain less understood. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) are a group of extracellular matrix proteases involved in tissue remodeling in both physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions. Previous studies have shown that MMP-9 exacerbates myopathy in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. However, the role and the mechanisms of action of MMP-9 in cardiac tissue and the biochemical mechanisms leading to increased levels of MMP-9 in mdx mice remain unknown. Our results demonstrate that the levels of MMP-9 are increased in the heart of mdx mice. Genetic ablation of MMP-9 attenuated cardiac injury, left ventricle dilation, and fibrosis in 1-y-old mdx mice. Echocardiography measurements showed improved heart function in Mmp9-deficient mdx mice. Deletion of the Mmp9 gene diminished the activation of ERK1/2 and Akt kinase in the heart of mdx mice. Ablation of MMP-9 also suppressed the expression of MMP-3 and MMP-12 in the heart of mdx mice. Finally, our experiments have revealed that osteopontin, an important immunomodulator, contributes to the increased amounts of MMP-9 in cardiac and skeletal muscle of mdx mice. This study provides a novel mechanism for development of cardiac dysfunction and suggests that MMP-9 and OPN are important therapeutic targets to mitigating cardiac abnormalities in patients with DMD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The stromal interaction molecules STIM1 and STIM2 are Ca(2+)  sensors, mostly located in the endoplasmic reticulum, that detect changes in the intraluminal Ca(2+)  concentration and communicate this information to plasma membrane store-operated channels, including members of the Orai family, thus mediating store-operated Ca(2+)  entry (SOCE). Orai and STIM proteins are almost ubiquitously expressed in human cells, where SOCE has been reported to play a relevant functional role. The phenotype of patients bearing mutations in STIM and Orai proteins, together with models of STIM or Orai deficiency in mice, as well as other organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster, have provided compelling evidence on the relevant role of these proteins in cellular physiology and pathology. Orai1-deficient patients suffer from severe immunodeficiency, congenital myopathy, chronic pulmonary disease, anhydrotic ectodermal dysplasia and defective dental enamel calcification. STIM1-deficient patients showed similar abnormalities, as well as autoimmune disorders. This review summarizes the current evidence that identifies and explains diseases induced by disturbances in SOCE due to deficiencies or mutations in Orai and STIM proteins.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The intermediate filament protein desmin is an integral component of the cardiomyocyte and serves to maintain the overall structure and cytoskeletal organization within striated muscle cells. Desmin-related myopathy can be caused by mutations in desmin or associated proteins, which leads to intracellular accumulation of misfolded protein and production of soluble pre-amyloid oligomers, which leads to weakened skeletal and cardiac muscle. In this review, we examine the cellular phenotypes in relevant animal models of desmin-related cardiomyopathy. These models display characteristic sarcoplasmic protein aggregates. Aberrant protein aggregation leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal metabolism, and altered cardiomyocyte structure. These deficits to cardiomyocyte function may stem from impaired cellular proteolytic mechanisms. The data obtained from these models allow a more complete picture of the pathology in desmin-related cardiomyopathy to be described. Moreover, these studies highlight the importance of desmin in maintaining cardiomyocyte structure and illustrate how disrupting this network can be deleterious to the heart. We emphasize the similarities observed between desmin-related cardiomyopathy and other protein conformational disorders and speculate that therapies to treat this disease may be broadly applicable to diverse protein aggregation-based disorders.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>p97/VCP/Cdc48 is one of the best-characterized type II AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) ATPases. p97 is suggested to be a ubiquitin-selective chaperone and its key function is to disassemble protein complexes. p97 is involved in a wide variety of cellular activities. Recently, novel functions, namely autophagy and mitochondrial quality control, for p97 have been uncovered. p97 was identified as a causative factor for inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) and more recently as a causative factor for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In this review, we will summarize and discuss recent progress and topics in p97 functions and the relationship to its associated diseases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in tripartite motif protein 32 (TRIM32) are responsible for several hereditary disorders that include limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H (LGMD2H), sarcotubular myopathy (STM) and Bardet Biedl syndrome. Most LGMD2H mutations in TRIM32 are clustered in the NHL β-propeller domain at the C-terminus and are predicted to interfere with homodimerization. To get insight into TRIM32's role in the pathogenesis of LGMD2H and to create an accurate model of disease, we have generated a knock-in mouse (T32KI) carrying the c.1465G > A (p.D489N) mutation in murine Trim32 corresponding to the human LGMD2H/STM pathogenic mutation c.1459G > A (p.D487N). Our data indicate that T32KI mice have both a myopathic and a neurogenic phenotype, very similar to the one described in the Trim32-null mice that we created previously. Analysis of Trim32 gene expression in T32KI mice revealed normal mRNA levels, but a severe reduction in mutant TRIM32 (D489N) at the protein level. Our results suggest that the D489N pathogenic mutation destabilizes the protein, leading to its degradation, and results in the same mild myopathic and neurogenic phenotype as that found in Trim32-null mice. Thus, one potential mechanism of LGMD2H might be destabilization of mutated TRIM32 protein leading to a null phenotype.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dynamin (Dyn) is a multidomain and multifunctional GTPase best known for its essential role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Dyn2 mutations have been linked to two human diseases, centronuclear myopathy (CNM) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. Paradoxically, although Dyn2 is ubiquitously expressed and essential for embryonic development, the disease-associated Dyn2 mutants are autosomal dominant, but result in slowly progressing and tissue-specific diseases. Thus, although the cellular defects that cause disease remain unclear, they are expected to be mild. To gain new insight into potential pathogenic mechanisms, we utilized mouse Dyn2 conditional knockout cells combined with retroviral-mediated reconstitution to mimic both heterozygous and homozygous states and characterized cellular phenotypes using quantitative assays for several membrane trafficking events. Surprisingly, none of the four mutants studied exhibited a defect in CME, but all were impaired in their ability to support p75/neurotrophin receptor export from the Golgi, the raft-dependent endocytosis of cholera toxin and the clathrin-independent endocytosis of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). While it will be important to study these mutants in disease-relevant muscle and neuronal cells, given the importance of neurotrophic factors and lipid rafts in muscle physiology, we speculate that these common cellular defects might contribute to the tissue-specific diseases caused by a ubiquitously expressed protein.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the nebulin gene are the main cause of autosomal recessive nemaline myopathy, with clinical presentations ranging from mild to severe disease. We have previously reported a nonspecific distal myopathy caused by homozygous missense mutations in the nebulin gene in six Finnish patients from four different families. Here we describe three non-Finnish patients in two unrelated families with distal nemaline myopathy caused by four different compound heterozygous nebulin mutations, only one of which is a missense mutation. One of the mutations has previously been identified in one family with the severe form of nemaline myopathy. We conclude that nemaline myopathy and distal myopathy caused by nebulin mutations form a clinical and histological continuum. Nemaline myopathy should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with an early-onset predominantly distal myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Many myopathies share clinical features in common, and diagnosis often requires genetic testing. We ascertained a family in which five siblings presented with distal muscle weakness of unknown etiology. METHODS: We performed high-density genomewide linkage analysis and mutation screening of candidate genes to identify the genetic defect in the family. Preserved clinical biopsy material was reviewed to confirm the diagnosis, and reverse transcriptase PCR was used to determine the molecular effect of a splice site mutation. RESULTS: The linkage scan excluded the majority of known myopathy genes, but one linkage peak included the gene GNE, in which mutations cause autosomal recessive hereditary inclusion body myopathy type 2 (HIBM2). Muscle biopsy tissue from a patient showed myopathic features, including small basophilic fibers with vacuoles. Sequence analysis of GNE revealed affected individuals were compound heterozygous for a novel mutation in the 5' splice donor site of intron 10 (c.1816+5G>A) and a previously reported missense mutation (c.2086G>A, p.V696M), confirming the diagnosis as HIBM2. The splice site mutation correlated with exclusion of exon 10 from the transcript, which is predicted to produce an in-frame deletion (p.G545_D605del) of 61 amino acids in the kinase domain of the GNE protein. The father of the proband was heterozygous for the splice site mutation and exhibited mild distal weakness late in life. CONCLUSIONS: Our study expands on the extensive allelic heterogeneity of HIBM2 and demonstrates the value of linkage analysis in resolving ambiguous clinical findings to achieve a molecular diagnosis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Maintenance and replication of mitochondrial DNA require the concerted action of several factors encoded by nuclear genome. The mitochondrial helicase Twinkle is a key player of replisome machinery. Heterozygous mutations in its coding gene, PEO1, are associated with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) characterised by ptosis and ophthalmoparesis, with cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-deficient fibres, ragged-red fibres (RRF) and multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle. Here we describe clinical, histological and molecular features of two patients presenting with mitochondrial myopathy associated with PEO. PEO1 sequencing disclosed two novel mutations in exons 1 and 4 of the gene, respectively. Although mutations in PEO1 exon 1 have already been described, this is the first report of mutation occurring in exon 4.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is caused by mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene. We report a new distal phenotype caused by VCP gene mutation in a Finnish family with nine affected members in three generations. Patients had onset of distal leg muscle weakness and atrophy in the anterior compartment muscles after age 35, which caused a foot drop at age 50. None of the siblings had scapular winging, proximal myopathy, cardiomyopathy or respiratory problems during long-term follow-up. Three distal myopathy patients developed rapidly progressive dementia, became bedridden and died of cachexia and pneumonia and VCP gene mutation P137L (c.410C>T) was then identified in the family. Late onset autosomal dominant distal myopathy with rimmed vacuolar muscle pathology was not sufficient for exact diagnosis in this family until late-occurring dementia provided the clue for molecular diagnosis. VCP needs to be considered in the differential diagnostic work-up in patients with distal myopathy phenotype.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>FHL1, BAG3, MATR3 and PTRF are recently identified myopathy genes associated with phenotypes that overlap muscular dystrophy. TCAP is a rare reported cause of muscular dystrophy not routinely screened in most centres. We hypothesised that these genes may account for patients with undiagnosed forms of muscular dystrophy in Australia. We screened a large cohort of muscular dystrophy patients for abnormalities in FHL1 (n=102) and TCAP (n=100) and selected patients whose clinical features overlapped the phenotypes previously described for BAG3 (n=9), MATR3 (n=15) and PTRF (n=7). We found one FHL1 mutation (c.311G>A, p.C104Y) in a boy with rapidly progressive muscle weakness and reducing body myopathy who was initially diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. We identified no pathogenic mutations in BAG3, MATR3, PTRF or TCAP. In conclusion, we have excluded these five genes as common causes of muscular dystrophy in Australia. Patients with reducing body myopathy may be initially diagnosed as muscular dystrophy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical course and genotype-phenotype correlations in patients with selenoprotein-related myopathy (SEPN1-RM) due to selenoprotein N1 gene (SEPN1) mutations for a retrospective cross-sectional study. METHODS: Forty-one patients aged 1-60 years were included. Clinical data including scoliosis, respiratory function, and growth measurements were collected by case note review. RESULTS: Mean age at onset was 2.7 years, ranging from birth to the second decade of life. All but 2 remained independently ambulant: one lost ambulation at age 5 years and another in his late 50s. The mean age of starting nocturnal noninvasive ventilation (NIV) was 13.9 years. One child required full-time NIV at the age of 1 year while in 2 cases NIV was started at 33 years. Two patients died from respiratory failure at the age of 10 and 22 years, respectively. The mean age at scoliosis onset was 10 years, in most cases preceded by rigidity of the spine. Fourteen patients had successful spinal surgery (mean age 13.9 years). Twenty-one were underweight; however, overt feeding difficulties were not a feature. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the largest population affected by SEPN1-RM reported so far. Our findings show that the spectrum of severity is wider than previously reported. Respiratory insufficiency generally develops by 14 years but may occur as early as in infancy or not until the fourth decade. Motor abilities remain essentially static over time even in patients with early presentation. Most adult patients remain ambulant and fully employed.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular etiology of 2 unrelated patients with a multisystem mitochondrial disorder accompanied by optic atrophy in one of them. DESIGN: Clinical examination and neurophysiological, radiological, morphological, and molecular analyses. SETTING: Tertiary care neuromuscular clinic and molecular genetics laboratory. PATIENTS: A 65-year-old man (patient 1) with dyschromatopsia and vision loss since childhood developed progressive external ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and myopathy in the seventh decade of life and was found to have optic atrophy. A 63-year-old man (patient 2) with a similar phenotype, without visual symptoms, experienced also hearing loss and parkinsonism. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Description of the clinical and molecular findings. RESULTS: A muscle biopsy specimen showed ragged-red, ragged-blue, and cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibers in both patients. Because optic atrophy in patient 1 suggested an autosomal dominant OPA1-related disorder, the OPA1 gene was first sequenced, the results of which did not detect any mutations. Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction analyses of muscle mitochondrial DNA revealed multiple deletions. Sequencing of POLG detected a novel variant, c.3104 + 3A>T, in both patients. Patient 1 was compound heterozygous for a known p.F749S mutation; patient 2 had p.G848S as the second mutation. Analysis of POLG complementary DNA showed that c.3104 + 3A>T results in skipping of exon 18. CONCLUSION: Early-onset dyschromatopsia and optic atrophy can occur not only in OPA1-related but also in POLG-related disorders with significant impact on genetic counseling.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Paralysis periodica paramyotonia (PPP) is caused by mutation of the adult skeletal muscle sodium channel gene's alpha (α)-subunit (SCN4A). Here, we report four generations of a Chinese family affected by a remarkably severe form of PPP with progressive myopathy. Routine electromyograms (EMG) showed myotonic discharge and after a long exercise test, compound motor action potential amplitudes were markedly decreased by 40-55%. Muscle biopsy revealed obvious vacuolar changes. Moreover, genetic analysis revealed the Met1592Val mutation in the α-subunit, SCN4A. The patients showed a striking clinical and electrophysiological improvement during treatment with acetazolamide. Thus, our findings showed that mutation of Met1592Val in the SCN4A gene is associated with aggressive development of PPP characterized by severe vacuolar myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations of PYGM, the gene encoding human myophosphorylase, produce a metabolic myopathy characterised by exercise intolerance and, in some patients, myoglobinuria. To illustrate the clinical and laboratory features of myophosphorylase deficiency, we describe 10 patients diagnosed in Auckland, New Zealand, between 1989 and 2009. We review the clinical, biochemical, and histologic features and the results of mutation analysis. All patients reported exercise intolerance since childhood or the teenage years, starting within minutes of moderate or intense exertion. The "second wind" phenomenon, or myoglobinuria, were each reported in about half the patients. The serum creatine kinase concentration was elevated in all patients where this had been measured. Muscle biopsies revealed subsarcolemmal vacuolation and histochemical absence of myophosphorylase. Analysis of PYGM showed mutations in all alleles, most commonly Arg49Ter or Gly204Ser. One patient harbored a novel mutation, Pro488Arg, predicted to seriously disrupt the tertiary structure of the enzyme. Myophosphorylase deficiency produces a fairly uniform set of symptoms, and consistent elevation of the serum creatine kinase concentration. The diagnosis can be confirmed in most patients by mutation analysis using a blood sample.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in LMNA cause wide variety of disorders including Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, limb girdle muscular dystrophy, and congenital muscular dystrophy. We recently found a LMNA mutation in a patient who was previously diagnosed as infantile onset inflammatory myopathy. In this study, we screened for LMNA mutations in 20 patients suspected to have inflammatory myopathy with onset at 2years or younger. The diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy was based on muscle pathology with presence of perivascular cuffing and/or endomysial/perimysial lymphocyte infiltration. We identified heterozygous LMNA mutations in 11 patients (55%), who eventually developed joint contractures and/or cardiac involvement after the infantile period. Our findings suggest that LMNA mutation should be considered in myopathy patients with inflammatory changes during infancy, and that this may help avoid life-threatening events associated with laminopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the four-and-a-half LIM domain 1 (FHL1) gene, which encodes a 280-amino-acid protein containing four LIM domains and a single zinc-finger domain in the N-terminal region, have been associated with a broad clinical spectrum of X-linked muscle diseases encompassing a variety of different phenotypes. Patients might present with a scapuloperoneal myopathy, a myopathy with postural muscle atrophy and generalized hypertrophy, an Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, or an early onset myopathy with reducing bodies. It has been proposed that the phenotypic variability is related to the position of the mutation within the FHL1 gene. Here, we report on three British families with a heterogeneous clinical presentation segregating a single FHL1 gene mutation and haplotype, suggesting that this represents a founder mutation. The underlying FHL1 gene mutation was detected by direct sequencing and the founder effect was verified by haplotype analysis of the FHL1 gene locus. A 3-bp insertion mutation (p.Phe127_Thr128insIle) within the second LIM domain of the FHL1 gene was identified in all available affected family members of the three families. Haplotype analysis of the FHL1 region on Xq26 revealed that the families shared a common haplotype. The p.Phe127_Thr128insIle mutation in the FHL1 gene therefore appears to be a British founder mutation and FHL1 gene screening, in particular of exon 6, should therefore be indicated in British patients with a broad phenotypic spectrum of X-linked muscle diseases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Muscle-eye-brain disease (MEB) and Walker Warburg Syndrome (WWS) belong to a spectrum of autosomal recessive diseases characterized by ocular dysgenesis, neuronal migration defects, and congenital muscular dystrophy. Until now, the pathophysiology of MEB/WWS has been attributed to alteration in dystroglycan post-translational modification. Here, we provide evidence that mutations in a gene coding for a major basement membrane protein, collagen IV alpha 1 (COL4A1), are a novel cause of MEB/WWS. Using a combination of histological, molecular, and biochemical approaches, we show that heterozygous Col4a1 mutant mice have ocular dysgenesis, neuronal localization defects, and myopathy characteristic of MEB/WWS. Importantly, we identified putative heterozygous mutations in COL4A1 in two MEB/WWS patients. Both mutations occur within conserved amino acids of the triple-helix-forming domain of the protein, and at least one mutation interferes with secretion of the mutant proteins, resulting instead in intracellular accumulation. Expression and posttranslational modification of dystroglycan is unaltered in Col4a1 mutant mice indicating that COL4A1 mutations represent a distinct pathogenic mechanism underlying MEB/WWS. These findings implicate a novel gene and a novel mechanism in the etiology of MEB/WWS and expand the clinical spectrum of COL4A1-associated disorders.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotonic dystrophy is the most common muscular dystrophy in adults and the first recognized example of an RNA-mediated disease. Congenital myotonic dystrophy (CDM1) and myotonic dystrophy of type 1 (DM1) or of type 2 (DM2) are caused by the expression of mutant RNAs containing expanded CUG or CCUG repeats, respectively. These mutant RNAs sequester the splicing regulator Muscleblind-like-1 (MBNL1), resulting in specific misregulation of the alternative splicing of other pre-mRNAs. We found that alternative splicing of the bridging integrator-1 (BIN1) pre-mRNA is altered in skeletal muscle samples of people with CDM1, DM1 and DM2. BIN1 is involved in tubular invaginations of membranes and is required for the biogenesis of muscle T tubules, which are specialized skeletal muscle membrane structures essential for excitation-contraction coupling. Mutations in the BIN1 gene cause centronuclear myopathy, which shares some histopathological features with myotonic dystrophy. We found that MBNL1 binds the BIN1 pre-mRNA and regulates its alternative splicing. BIN1 missplicing results in expression of an inactive form of BIN1 lacking phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate-binding and membrane-tubulating activities. Consistent with a defect of BIN1, muscle T tubules are altered in people with myotonic dystrophy, and membrane structures are restored upon expression of the normal splicing form of BIN1 in muscle cells of such individuals. Finally, reproducing BIN1 splicing alteration in mice is sufficient to promote T tubule alterations and muscle weakness, a predominant feature of myotonic dystrophy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The estimated incidence of mitochondrial diseases in humans is approximately 1:5000 to 1:10,000, whereas the molecular mechanisms for more than 50% of human mitochondrial disease cases still remain unclear. Here we report that mice lacking testicular nuclear receptor 4 (TR4(-/-)) suffered mitochondrial myopathy, and histological examination of TR4(-/-) soleus muscle revealed abnormal mitochondrial accumulation. In addition, increased serum lactate levels, decreased mitochondrial ATP production, and decreased electron transport chain complex I activity were found in TR4(-/-) mice. Restoration of TR4 into TR4(-/-) myoblasts rescued mitochondrial ATP generation capacity and complex I activity. Further real-time PCR quantification and promoter studies found TR4 could modulate complex I activity via transcriptionally regulating the complex I assembly factor NDUFAF1, and restoration of NDUFAF1 level in TR4(-/-) myoblasts increased mitochondrial ATP generation capacity and complex I activity. Together, these results suggest that TR4 plays vital roles in mitochondrial function, which may help us to better understand the pathogenesis of mitochondrial myopathy, and targeting TR4 via its ligands/activators may allow us to develop better therapeutic approaches.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Linkage analysis of the dominant distal myopathy we previously identified in a large Australian family demonstrated one significant linkage region located on chromosome 7 and encompassing 18.6 Mbp and 151 genes. The strongest candidate gene was FLNC because filamin C, the encoded protein, is muscle-specific and associated with myofibrillar myopathy. Sequencing of FLNC cDNA identified a c.752T>C (p.Met251Thr) mutation in the N-terminal actin-binding domain (ABD); this mutation segregated with the disease and was absent in 200 controls. We identified an Italian family with the same phenotype and found a c.577G>A (p.Ala193Thr) filamin C ABD mutation that segregated with the disease. Filamin C ABD mutations have not been described, although filamin A and filamin B ABD mutations cause multiple musculoskeletal disorders. The distal myopathy phenotype and muscle pathology in the two families differ from myofibrillar myopathies caused by filamin C rod and dimerization domain mutations because of the distinct involvement of hand muscles and lack of pathological protein aggregation. Thus, like the position of FLNA and B mutations, the position of the FLNC mutation determines disease phenotype. The two filamin C ABD mutations increase actin-binding affinity in a manner similar to filamin A and filamin B ABD mutations. Cell-culture expression of the c.752T>C (p.Met251)Thr mutant filamin C ABD demonstrated reduced nuclear localization as did mutant filamin A and filamin B ABDs. Expression of both filamin C ABD mutants as full-length proteins induced increased aggregation of filamin. We conclude filamin C ABD mutations cause a recognizable distal myopathy, most likely through increased actin affinity, similar to the pathological mechanism of filamin A and filamin B ABD mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the heart and muscle isoform of adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT1) are associated with autosomal-dominant progressive external opthalmoplegia (adPEO) clinically characterized by exercise intolerance, ptosis and muscle weakness. The pathogenic mechanisms underlying the mitochondrial myopathy caused by ANT1 mutations remain largely unknown. In yeast, expression of ANT1 carrying mutations corresponding to the human adPEO ones causes a wide range of mitochondrial abnormalities. However, functional studies of ANT1 mutations in mammalian cells are lacking, because they have been hindered by the fact that ANT1 expression leads to apoptotic cell death in commonly utilized replicating cell lines. Here, we successfully express functional ANT1 in differentiated mouse myotubes, which naturally contain high levels of ANT1, without causing cell death. We demonstrate, for the first time in these disease-relevant mammalian cells, that mutant human ANT1 causes dominant mitochondrial defects characterized by decreased ADP-ATP exchange function and abnormal translocator reversal potential. These abnormalities are not due to ANT1 loss of function, because knocking down Ant1 in myotubes causes functional changes different from ANT1 mutants. Under certain physiological conditions, mitochondria consume ATP to maintain membrane potential by reversing the ADP-ATP transport. The modified properties of mutant ANT1 can be responsible for disease pathogenesis in adPEO, because exchange reversal occurring at higher than normal membrane potential can cause excessive energy depletion and nucleotide imbalance in ANT1 mutant muscle cells.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlinopathies are autosomal recessive disorders caused by mutations in the dysferlin (DYSF) gene, encoding the dysferlin protein. DYSF mutations lead to a wide range of muscular phenotypes, with the most prominent being Miyoshi myopathy (MM) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) and the second most common being LGMD. Symptoms generally appear at the end of childhood and, although disease progression is typically slow, walking impairments eventually result. Dysferlin is a modular type II transmembrane protein for which numerous binding partners have been identified. Although dysferlin function is only partially elucidated, this large protein contains seven calcium sensor C2 domains, shown to play a key role in muscle membrane repair. On the basis of this major function, along with detailed clinical observations, it has been possible to design various therapeutic approaches for dysferlin-deficient patients. Among them, exon-skipping and minigene transfer strategies have been evaluated at the preclinical level and, to date, represent promising approaches for clinical trials. This review aims to summarize the pathophysiology of dysferlinopathies and to evaluate the therapeutic potential for treatments currently under development.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Neutral lipid storage disease is caused by mutations in the CGI-58 or the PNPLA2 genes. Lipid storage can be detected in various cell types including blood granulocytes. While CGI-58 mutations are associated with Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome, a condition characterized by lipid storage and skin involvement (ichthyosis), mutations in the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 2 gene (PNPLA2) were reported with skeletal and cardiac muscle disease only. We describe clinical, myopathological, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and genetic findings of six patients carrying different recessive PNPLA2 mutations. Pulse-chase labeling of control and patient cells with supplementation of clenbuterol, salmeterol, and dexamethasone was performed in vitro. The patients share a recognizable phenotype with prominent shoulder girdle weakness and mild pelvic girdle and distal muscle weakness, with highly elevated creatine kinase (CK) and cardiomyopathy developing at later stages. Muscle histology invariably reveals massive accumulation of lipid droplets. New muscle or whole-body MRI techniques may assist diagnosis and may become a useful tool to quantify intramuscular lipid storage. Four novel and two previously reported mutations were detected, affecting different parts of the PNPLA2 gene. Activation of hormone-sensitive lipase by beta-adrenergic substances such as clenbuterol appears to bypass the enzymatic block in PNPLA2-deficient patient cells in vitro. PNPLA2 deficiency is a slowly progressive myopathy with onset around the third decade. Cardiac involvement is relatively common at a later stage. Muscle MRI may detect increased lipid in a characteristic distribution, which could be used for monitoring disease progression. Beta-adrenergic agents may be beneficial in improving triacylglycerol breakdown in patients with PNPLA2 mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlin is a 237-kDa transmembrane protein involved in calcium-mediated sarcolemma resealing. Dysferlin gene mutations cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2B, Miyoshi myopathy (MM) and distal myopathy of the anterior tibialis. Considering that a secondary Dysferlin reduction has also been described in other myopathies, our original goal was to identify cases with a Dysferlin deficiency without dysferlin gene mutations. The dysferlin gene is huge, composed of 55 exons that span 233 140 bp of genomic DNA. We performed a thorough mutation analysis in 65 LGMD/MM patients with ≤20% Dysferlin. The screening was exhaustive, as we sequenced both genomic DNA and cDNA. When required, we used other methods, including real-time PCR, long PCR and array CGH. In all patients, we were able to recognize the primary involvement of the dysferlin gene. We identified 38 novel mutation types. Some of these, such as a dysferlin gene duplication, could have been missed by conventional screening strategies. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay was evident in six cases, in three of which both alleles were only detectable in the genomic DNA but not in the mRNA. Among a wide spectrum of novel gene defects, we found the first example of a 'nonstop' mutation causing a dysferlinopathy. This study presents the first direct and conclusive evidence that an amount of Dysferlin ≤20% is pathogenic and always caused by primary dysferlin gene mutations. This demonstrates the high specificity of a marked reduction of Dysferlin on western blot and the value of a comprehensive molecular approach for LGMD2B/MM diagnosis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Coenzyme Q (CoQ or ubiquinone) is a lipid-soluble component of virtually all types of cell membranes and has been shown to play multiple metabolic functions. Several clinical diseases including encephalomyopathy, cerebellar ataxia and isolated myopathy were shown to be associated with CoQ deficiency. However, the role of CoQ in immunity has not been defined. In the present study, we showed that flies defective in CoQ biosynthetic gene coq2 were more susceptible to bacterial and fungal infections, while were more resistant to viruses. We found that Drosophila contained both CoQ9 and CoQ10, and food supplement of CoQ10 could partially rescue the impaired immune functions of coq2 mutants. Surprisingly, wild-type flies fed CoQ10 became more susceptible to viral infection, which suggested that extra caution should be taken when using CoQ10 as a food supplement. We further showed that CoQ was essential for normal induction of anti-microbial peptides and amplification of viruses. Our work determined CoQ content in Drosophila and described its function in immunity for the first time.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>King-Denborough syndrome (KDS), first described in 1973, is a rare condition characterised by the triad of dysmorphic features, myopathy, and malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS). Autosomal dominant inheritance with variable expressivity has been reported in several cases. Mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene have been implicated in a wide range of myopathies such as central core disease (CCD), the malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility trait and one isolated patient with KDS. Here we report clinical, pathologic and genetic features of four unrelated patients with KDS. Patients had a relatively uniform clinical presentation but muscle biopsy findings were highly variable. Heterozygous missense mutations in RYR1 were uncovered in three out of four families, of which one mutation was novel and two have previously been reported in MH. Further RyR1 protein expression studies performed in two families showed marked reduction of the RyR1 protein, indicating the presence of allelic RYR1 mutations not detectable on routine sequencing and potentially explaining marked intrafamilial variability. Our findings support the hypothesis that RYR1 mutations are associated with King-Denborough syndrome but that further genetic heterogeneity is likely.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dynamin 2 (DNM2) is a large GTPase implicated in many cellular functions, including cytoskeleton regulation and endocytosis. Although ubiquitously expressed, DNM2 was found mutated in two genetic disorders affecting different tissues: autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (ADCNM; skeletal muscle) and peripheral Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (peripheral nerve). To gain insight into the function of DNM2 in skeletal muscle and the pathological mechanisms leading to ADCNM, we introduced wild-type DNM2 (WT-DNM2) or R465W DNM2 (RW-DNM2), the most common ADCNM mutation, into adult wild-type mouse skeletal muscle by intramuscular adeno-associated virus injections. We detected altered localization of RW-DNM2 in mouse muscle. Several ADCNM features were present in RW-DNM2 mice: fiber atrophy, nuclear mislocalization, and altered mitochondrial staining, with a corresponding reduction in specific maximal muscle force. The sarcomere and triad structures were also altered. We report similar findings in muscle biopsy specimens from an ADCNM patient with the R465W mutation. In addition, expression of wild-type DNM2 induced some muscle defects, albeit to a lesser extent than RW-DNM2, suggesting that the R465W mutation has enhanced activity in vivo. In conclusion, we show the RW-DNM2 mutation acts in a dominant manner to cause ADCNM in adult muscle, and the disease arises from a primary defect in skeletal muscle rather than secondary to peripheral nerve involvement. Therefore, DNM2 plays important roles in the maintenance of adult muscle fibers.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We examined three patients with a severe infantile type of congenital myopathy due to dominant, missense ACTA1 mutations. In addition to muscle weakness, all three patients showed developmental delay in word comprehension during early childhood. All also showed frontal lobe hypoplasia and lateral ventricular dilatation. One patient in addition exhibited features of multiple congenital malformations including skeletal dysplasia, hepatomegaly and urinary tract stenosis. These findings may suggest a link between extramuscular expression of α-skeletal muscle actin and clinical symptoms in non-skeletal muscle tissues of patients with ACTA1 mutations, and probably a functional role of α-skeletal muscle actin during fetal development.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) usually occurs as an isolated condition, but it may occur in association with another autoimmune disorder such as Sjögren's syndrome. We reviewed sIBM cases with Sjögren's syndrome (sIBM/SS) from the Perth Inflammatory Myopathies Database to determine whether they are distinguishable from other sIBM cases. Six such cases were identified, representing 12% of all sIBM cases. Muscle biopsies confirmed the presence of an inflammatory myopathy with rimmed vacuoles and the characteristic muscle fibre inclusions of sIBM. Five of the six were females, contrasting with a 2:1 male preponderance in the rest of the sIBM cohort. The mean age-at-onset and the pattern of muscle weakness were similar in the two groups. Four out of five sIBM/SS patients treated with immune therapies had improvement in muscle strength lasting for 6-24 months, whereas only 27% of other sIBM patients improved. All 6 patients with sIBM/SS carried the HLA-DRB1*0301 allele, or its equivalent HLA-DR3 serological specificity, compared with 83% of other sIBM cases and all carried some or all of the major markers of the 8.1 MHC ancestral haplotype which is also associated with Sjögren's syndrome. Patients with sIBM/SS represent a subgroup of sIBM cases who are more likely to be female and carriers of HLA-DR3 and the 8.1 MHC ancestral haplotype, and are more likely to respond to treatment. The association of sIBM and Sjögren's syndrome is likely to be due to a common genetic predisposition linked to the MHC and supports the notion that sIBM has an autoimmune basis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Caveolae are specialized lipid rafts localized on the cytoplasmic surface of the sarcolemmal membrane. Caveolae contribute to the maintenance of plasma membrane integrity, constitute specific macromolecular complexes that provide highly localized regulation of ion channels, and regulate vesicular trafficking and signal transduction. In skeletal muscle, the main structural assembly of caveolae is mediated by caveolin-3. Another family of adapter proteins, the cavins, is involved in the regulation of caveolae function and in the trafficking of caveolin-derived structures. Caveolin-3 defects lead to four distinct skeletal muscle disease phenotypes: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, rippling muscle disease, distal myopathy, and hyperCKemia. Many patients show an overlap of these symptoms, and the same mutation can be linked to different clinical phenotypes. An ever-growing interest is also focused on the association between caveolin-3 mutations and heart disorders. Indeed, caveolin-3 mutants have been described in a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and two patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and mutations in the caveolin-3 gene (CAV3) have been identified in patients affected by congenital long QT syndrome. Although caveolin-3 deficiency represents the primary event, multiple secondary molecular mechanisms lead to muscle tissue damage. Among these, sarcolemmal membrane alterations, disorganization of skeletal muscle T-tubule network, and disruption of distinct cell signaling pathways have been determined.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2H is a slowly progressive condition characterized by proximal weakness, atrophy, and mildly to moderately raised levels of creatine kinase. Facial weakness, scapular winging, hypertrophied calves, and Achilles tendon contractions are not uncommon and the age of onset ranges between the first and fourth decade. LGMD2H was originally described in the Hutterite population that resides in central Canada and the Dakotas of the USA. LGMD2H was mapped to a specific mutation in the TRIM32 gene and it has subsequently been shown that the same mutation also results in the "sarcotubular myopathy" syndrome, which was described histopathologically. TRIM32 appears to be an E3 ubiquitin ligase, containing the tripartite motif common to this family of proteins (RING finger, B-box, coiled-coil). A few substrates have been identified, including actin and dysbindin. Recent studies have identified additional mutations in the C-terminal region of TRIM32 that result in a dystrophic myopathy. Although TRIM32 appears to be expressed ubiquitously, it is still not clear why certain mutations of TRIM32 would result in a phenotype relatively restricted to skeletal muscle. A mutation in the B-box region of TRIM32 has also been shown to result in a more pleiotropic disorder, Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS11). This disorder is associated with obesity, retinopathy, diabetes, polydactyly, renal abnormalities, learning disability, and hypogenitalism. It is likely that C-terminal mutations in TRIM32 affect the ability of muscle proteins to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a rare congenital muscle disorder, caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene. Affected male infants present severe hypotonia, and generalized muscle weakness, and the disorder is most often complicated by respiratory failure. Herein, we describe a family with 2 infants with XLMTM which was diagnosed by gene analysis and muscle biopsy. In both cases, histological findings of muscle showed severely hypoplastic muscle fibers with centrally placed nuclei. From the family gene analysis, the Arg486STOP mutation in the MTM1 gene was confirmed.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Both peripheral neuropathy and distal myopathy are well-established inherited neuromuscular disorders characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy of the distal limb muscles. A complex phenotype of peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, hoarseness, and hearing loss was diagnosed in a large autosomal dominant Korean family. A high density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based linkage study mapped the underlying gene to a region on chromosome 19q13.3. The maximum multipoint LOD score was 3.794. Sequencing of 34 positional candidate genes in the segregating haplotype revealed a novel c.2822G>T (p.Arg941Leu) mutation in the gene MYH14, which encodes the nonmuscle myosin heavy chain 14. Clinically we observed a sequential pattern of the onset of muscle weakness starting from the anterior to the posterior leg muscle compartments followed by involvement of intrinsic hand and proximal muscles. The hearing loss and hoarseness followed the onset of distal muscle weakness. Histopathologic and electrodiagnostic studies revealed both chronic neuropathic and myopathic features in the affected patients. Although mutations in MYH14 have been shown to cause nonsyndromic autosomal dominant hearing loss (DFNA4), the peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, and hoarseness have not been associated with MYH14. Therefore, we suggest that the identified mutation in MYH14 significantly expands the phenotypic spectrum of this gene.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotubularin is a 3-phosphoinositide phosphatase that is mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy, a severe neonatal disorder in which skeletal muscle development and/or regeneration is impaired. In this report we provide evidence that siRNA-mediated silencing of myotubularin expression markedly inhibits growth factor-stimulated Akt phosphorylation, leading to activation of caspase-dependent pro-apoptotic signaling in HeLa cells and primary human skeletal muscle myotubes. Myotubularin silencing also inhibits Akt-dependent signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 as assessed by p70 S6-kinase and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Similarly, phosphorylation of FoxO transcription factors is also significantly reduced in myotubularin-deficient cells. Our data further suggest that inhibition of Akt activation and downstream survival signaling in myotubularin-deficient cells is caused by accumulation of the MTMR substrate lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate generated from the type II phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase PIK3C2B. Our findings are significant because they suggest that myotubularin regulates Akt activation via a cellular pool of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate that is distinct from that generated by the type III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase hVps34. Because impaired Akt signaling has been tightly linked to skeletal muscle atrophy, we hypothesize that loss of Akt-dependent growth/survival cues due to impaired myotubularin function may be a critical factor underlying the severe skeletal muscle atrophy characteristic of muscle fibers in patients with X-linked myotubular myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The processes that trigger severe muscle atrophy and loss of myosin in critical illness myopathy (CIM) are poorly understood. It has been reported that muscle disuse alters Ca(2+) handling by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Since inactivity is an important contributor to CIM, this finding raises the possibility that elevated levels of the proteins involved in Ca(2+) handling might contribute to development of CIM. CIM was induced in 3-to 5-mo-old rats by sciatic nerve lesion and infusion of dexamethasone for 1 wk. Western blot analysis revealed increased levels of ryanodine receptor (RYR) isoforms-1 and -2 as well as the dihydropyridine receptor/voltage-gated calcium channel type 1.1 (DHPR/Ca(V) 1.1). Immunostaining revealed a subset of fibers with elevation of RYR1 and Ca(V) 1.1 that had severe atrophy and disorganization of sarcomeres. These findings suggest increased Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum may be an important contributor to development of CIM. To assess the endogenous functional effects of increased intracellular Ca(2+) in CIM, proteolysis of α-fodrin, a well-known target substrate of Ca(2+)-activated proteases, was measured and found to be 50% greater in CIM. There was also selective degradation of myosin heavy chain relative to actin in CIM muscle. Taken together, our findings suggest that increased Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum may contribute to pathology in CIM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The most common cause of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) deficiency is the deficit of the E1α-subunit. The aim of this study was to describe distinct course of the disease in two boys with mutations in PDHA1 gene and illustrate the possible obstacles in measurement of PDHc activity. Clinical data and metabolic profiles were collected and evaluated. PDHc and E1α-subunit activities were measured using radiometric assay. Subunits of PDHc were detected by Western blot. PDHA1 gene was analysed by direct sequencing. In patient 1, the initial hypotonia with psychomotor retardation was observed since early infancy. The child gradually showed symptoms of spasticity and arrest of psychomotor development. In patient 2, the disease manifested by seizures and hyporeflexia in the toddler age. The diagnosis was confirmed at the age of seven years after attacks of dystonia and clinical manifestation of myopathy with normal mental development. Brain MRI of both patients revealed lesions typical of Leigh syndrome. Enzymatic analyses revealed PDHc deficiency in isolated lymphocytes in the first but not in the second patient. The direct measurement of PDH E1-subunit revealed deficiency in this individual. In patient 1, a novel hemizigous mutation c.857C>T (Pro250Leu) was detected in the X-linked PDHA1 gene. Mutation c.367C>T (Arg88Cys) was found in patient 2. We present first two patients with PDHc deficit due to mutations in PDHA1 gene in the Czech Republic. We document the broad variability of clinical symptoms of this disease. We proved that normal PDHc activity may not exclude the disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Progressive muscle wasting, also known as myopathy or muscle atrophy is a debilitating and life-threatening disorder. Myopathy is a pathological condition of many diseases including cancer, diabetes, COPD, and AIDS and is a natural consequence of inactivity and aging (sarcopenia). Muscle atrophy occurs when there is a net loss of muscle mass resulting in a change in the balance between protein synthesis and protein degradation. The ubiquitin pathway and specific ubiquitin pathway enzymes have been directly implicated in the progression of atrophy. The ubiquitin E3 ligase Muscle-specific RING Finger E3 ligase (MuRF1) is upregulated and increases protein degradation and muscle wasting in numerous muscle atrophy models. The inhibition of MuRF1 could be a novel mechanism to prevent or reverse muscle wasting associated with various pathologies. We screened a small molecule library for inhibitors to MuRF1 activity and identified P013222, an inhibitor of MuRF1 autoubiquitylation. Further, P013222 was shown to inhibit MuRF1-dependent substrate ubiquitylation, and was active in inhibiting MuRF1 in a cellular atrophy model. Thus MuRF1 can be targeted in a specific manner and produce positive results in cellular atrophy models.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>An autosomal dominant missense mutation in αB-crystallin (αB-R120G) causes cataracts and desmin-related myopathy, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we report the development of an αB-R120G crystallin knock-in mouse model of these disorders. Knock-in αB-R120G mice were generated and analyzed with slit lamp imaging, gel permeation chromatography, immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, histology, and muscle strength assays. Wild-type, age-matched mice were used as controls for all studies. Both heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice developed myopathy. Moreover, homozygous mutant mice were significantly weaker than wild-type control littermates at 6 months of age. Cataract severity increased with age and mutant gene dosage. The total mass, precipitation, and interaction with the intermediate filament protein vimentin, as well as light scattering of αB-crystallin, also increased in mutant lenses. In skeletal muscle, αB-R120G co-aggregated with desmin, became detergent insoluble, and was ubiquitinated in heterozygous and homozygous mutant mice. These data suggest that the cataract and myopathy pathologies in αB-R120G knock-in mice share common mechanisms, including increased insolubility of αB-crystallin and co-aggregation of αB-crystallin with intermediate filament proteins. These knock-in αB-R120G mice are a valuable model of the developmental and molecular biological mechanisms that underlie the pathophysiology of human hereditary cataracts and myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Many clinical features of autosomal centronuclear myopathies (CNM) and X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) are common to congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS). We describe three children whose clinical and electrophysiological findings originally suggested CMS, in whom CNM was diagnosed pathologically, though not yet genetically characterised. A fourth case, with XLMTM, also showed electrophysiological features of a neuromuscular transmission defect. Three (including the XLMTM case) showed improved strength with acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment. We also studied neuromuscular junction structure and function in the MTM1 knockdown zebrafish model of XLMTM, demonstrating abnormal neuromuscular junction organization; anticholinesterase therapy resulted in marked clinical response. These observations suggest that a neuromuscular transmission defect may accompany CNM and contribute to muscle weakness. Muscle biopsy should be considered in infants suspected to have CMS, especially if treatment response is incomplete, or no CMS gene mutation is identified. Treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may benefit some CNM patients. This warrants further confirmation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To detect gene mutations on beta-myosin heavy chain gene MYH7 in 3 Chinese families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and to analyze the correlation between genotype and phenotype. METHODS: A denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and sequencing mutation screening of the exons (exon3-23) coding for MYH7 gene were performed in 3 Chinese families with HCM. RESULTS: In this study, we identified several mutations in MYH7. A mutation of Thr441Met previously reported in a patient with Laing distal myopathy was first identified in one Chinese pedigree. CONCLUSION: This study illustrated the high frequency of mutation in MYH7 gene in Chinese HCM families. Different mutations and carriers of the MYH7 gene present phenotypic heterogeneity. Mutation screening and analysis in HCM family could therefore facilitate the early HCM diagnosis and would be helpful for the prediction, prevention and early treatment of HCM linked with MYH7 gene mutation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A homozygous disruption or genetic mutation of the bag3 gene causes progressive myofibrillar myopathy in mouse and human skeletal and cardiac muscle disorder while mutations in the small heat shock protein αB-crystallin gene (CRYAB) are reported to be responsible for myofibrillar myopathy. Here, we demonstrate that BAG3 directly binds to wild-type αB-crystallin and the αB-crystallin mutant R120G, via the intermediate domain of BAG3. Peptides that inhibit this interaction in an in vitro binding assay indicate that two conserved Ile-Pro-Val regions of BAG3 are involved in the interaction with αB-crystallin, which is similar to results showing BAG3 binding to HspB8 and HspB6. BAG3 overexpression increased αB-crystallin R120G solubility and inhibited its intracellular aggregation in HEK293 cells. BAG3 suppressed cell death induced by αB-crystallin R120G overexpression in differentiating C2C12 mouse myoblast cells. Our findings indicate a novel function for BAG3 in inhibiting protein aggregation caused by the genetic mutation of CRYAB responsible for human myofibrillar myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), normally expressed at the sarcolemmal membrane, is known to be mislocalized to the sarcoplasm in several forms of muscular dystrophy. Our objectives were to characterize further the range of patients manifesting aberrant nNOS sarcolemmal immunolocalization and to study nNOS localization in animal models of nondystrophic myopathy. METHODS: We carried out a retrospective cross-sectional study. We performed immunofluorescent staining for nNOS on biopsy specimens from 161 patients with acquired and nondystrophin inherited neuromuscular conditions. The localization of sarcolemmal nNOS correlated with mobility and functional status. Muscle specimens from mouse models of steroid-induced and starvation-related atrophy were studied for qualitative and quantitative nNOS expression. RESULTS: Sarcolemmal nNOS staining was abnormal in 42% of patients with inherited myopathic conditions, 25% with acquired myopathic conditions, 57% with neurogenic conditions, and 93% with hypotonia. Interestingly, we found significant associations between mobility status or muscle function and sarcolemmal nNOS expression. Furthermore, mouse models of catabolic stress also demonstrated mislocalization of sarcolemmal nNOS. CONCLUSION: Our analyses indicate that nNOS mislocalization is observed in a broad range of nondystrophic neuromuscular conditions associated with impaired mobility status and catabolic stress. Our findings suggest that the assessment of sarcolemmal localization of nNOS represents an important tool for the evaluation of muscle biopsies of patients with a variety of inherited and acquired forms of neuromuscular disorders.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Laing myopathy is a distal myopathy caused by mutations in the tail of the slow beta-myosin heavy chain gene MYH7. A large cluster of patients belonging to different families, with Laing myopathy due to p.K1729del mutation, was found in the Safor region, Spain. The same mutation was previously reported in an American family with Italian ancestry. The possibility that p.K1729del in MYH7 might be a founder mutation in the Safor patients and the chance of a common origin with the Italian-American family mutation was investigated by haplotype analyses, mutation data origin estimation and historical inquiry. Our results show that the p.K1729del in MYH7 harboured by patients from the Safor indeed is a founder mutation. A common ancestral origin of this mutation in the Spanish and Italian families is also suggested because they all share a core SNP haplotype at locus MYH7. Data estimation yields the origin of the mutation in the Safor at the beginning of the XVII century, when the Moorish were spelt and the region was resettled with Italian families.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a genetically heterogeneous muscular disease that presents with muscular dystrophy, joint contractures, and cardiomyopathy with conduction defects. Mutations in several nuclear envelope protein genes have been associated with EDMD in less than half of patients, implying the existence of other causative and modifier genes. We therefore analyzed TMEM43, which encodes LUMA, a newly identified nuclear membrane protein and also a binding partner of emerin and lamins, to investigate whether LUMA may contribute to the pathomechanism of EDMD-related myopathy. METHODS: Forty-one patients with EDMD-related myopathy were enrolled. In vitro and in vivo transfection analyses were performed to assay the binding partners and oligomerization of mutant LUMA. RESULTS: We identified heterozygous missense mutations, p.Glu85Lys and p.Ile91Val in TMEM43, in 2 EDMD-related myopathy patients. Reduced nuclear staining of LUMA was observed in the muscle from the patient with p.Glu85Lys mutation. By in vitro transfection analysis, p.Glu85Lys mutant LUMA resulted to failure in oligomerization, a process that may be important for protein complex formation on nuclear membrane. Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time that LUMA can interact with another nuclear membrane protein, SUN2, in addition to emerin. Cells expressing mutant LUMA revealed reduced nuclear staining with or without aggregates of emerin and SUN2 together with a higher proportion of abnormally shaped nuclei. In vivo expression of mutant LUMA by electroporation in mouse tibialis anterior muscles likewise demonstrated the decreased staining of emerin and SUN2 on myonuclei. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that mutant LUMAs may be associated with EDMD-related myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlin deficiency leads to a peculiar form of muscular dystrophy due to a defect in sarcolemma repair and currently lacks a therapy. We developed a cell therapy protocol with wild-type adult murine mesoangioblasts. These cells differentiate with high efficiency into skeletal muscle in vitro but differ from satellite cells because they do not express Pax7. After intramuscular or intra-arterial administration to SCID/BlAJ mice, a novel model of dysferlinopathy, wild-type mesoangioblasts efficiently colonized dystrophic muscles and partially restored dysferlin expression. Nevertheless, functional assays performed on isolated single fibers from transplanted muscles showed a normal repairing ability of the membrane after laser-induced lesions; this result, which reflects gene correction of an enzymatic rather than a structural deficit, suggests that this myopathy may be easier to treat with cell or gene therapy than other forms of muscular dystrophies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In contrast to the usual slow disease progression in myofibrillar myopathies, patients with Bag3opathy often have a rapidly progressive and more severe phenotype with a worse prognosis. We describe a Chinese patient, born to non-consanguineous parents, who first presented at age 6 with clumsy walking and difficult climbing staircase. With a history of restrictive lung disease previously diagnosed as asthma, she progressed rapidly with proximal myopathy, rigid spine and bilateral tightening of the Achilles tendons requiring surgical elongation. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with restrictive physiology was shown by echocardiogram. Moreover, prolonged QT interval was also noted in the patient. Family history was unremarkable yet her father was incidentally found to have prolonged QT interval. Mutation analysis with genomic DNA of the proband showed heterozygous de novo known mutation c.626C>T (p.Pro209Leu) and a germline variation c.772C>T (p.Arg258Trp) in BAG3. Her father was found to be a carrier of c.772C>T. Muscle biopsy findings were suggestive of myofibrillar myopathy on light microscopy and ultrastructural studies. To our knowledge, this is the first Chinese case of Bag3opathy so far reported.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: In addition to inducing a self-limited myopathy, statin use is associated with an immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), with autoantibodies that recognize ∼200-kd and ∼100-kd autoantigens. The purpose of this study was to identify these molecules to help clarify the disease mechanism and facilitate diagnosis. METHODS: The effect of statin treatment on autoantigen expression was addressed by immunoprecipitation using sera from patients. The identity of the ∼100-kd autoantigen was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of in vitro-translated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) protein. HMGCR expression in muscle was analyzed by immunofluorescence. A cohort of myopathy patients was screened for anti-HMGCR autoantibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and genotyped for the rs4149056 C allele, a predictor of self-limited statin myopathy. RESULTS: Statin exposure induced expression of the ∼200-kd/∼100-kd autoantigens in cultured cells. HMGCR was identified as the ∼100-kd autoantigen. Competition experiments demonstrated no distinct autoantibodies recognizing the ∼200-kd protein. In muscle biopsy tissues from anti-HMGCR-positive patients, HMGCR expression was up-regulated in cells expressing neural cell adhesion molecule, a marker of muscle regeneration. Anti-HMGCR autoantibodies were found in 45 of 750 patients presenting to the Johns Hopkins Myositis Center (6%). Among patients ages 50 years and older, 92.3% had taken statins. The prevalence of the rs4149056 C allele was not increased in patients with anti-HMGCR. CONCLUSION: Statins up-regulate the expression of HMGCR, the major target of autoantibodies in statin-associated IMNM. Regenerating muscle cells express high levels of HMGCR, which may sustain the immune response even after statins are discontinued. These studies demonstrate a mechanistic link between an environmental trigger and the development of sustained autoimmunity. Detection of anti-HMGCR autoantibodies may facilitate diagnosis and direct therapy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nebulin is a giant protein expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle. Mutations in the nebulin gene (NEB) lead to muscle weakness and various congenital myopathies. Despite increasing clinical and scientific interest, the pathogenesis of weakness remains unknown. The present study, therefore, aims at unraveling the underlying molecular mechanisms. Hence, we recorded and analyzed the mechanics as well as the X-ray diffraction patterns of human membrane-permeabilized single muscle fibers expressing nebulin mutations. Results demonstrated that, during contraction, the cycling rate of myosin heads attaching to actin is dramatically perturbed, causing a reduction in the fraction of myosin-actin interactions in the strong binding state. This phenomenon prevents complete thin-filament activation, more especially proper and full tropomyosin movement, further limiting additional binding of myosin cross-bridges. At the cell level, this reduces the force-generating capacity and, overall, provokes muscle weakness. To reverse such a negative cascade of events, future potential therapeutic interventions should, therefore, focus on the triggering component, the altered myosin cross-bridge cycling kinetics.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenation deficiency (MADD) is an autosomal recessive disease affecting amino acid, fatty acid, and choline metabolisms and is a common genetic defect responsible for lipid storage myopathy. Most forms of MADD are caused by a deficiency of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) or ETF dehydrogenase (ETFDH). However, its molecular feature has not been found uniformly in previous reports of Chinese patients. A large cohort of 56 late-onset MADD patients from 51 unrelated pedigrees in southern China was recruited to investigate a clear correlation between clinical phenotype and molecular genetic basis. All exons of ETFA, ETFB, and ETFDH, including the intron-exon boundaries, and 5' and 3' untranslated regions were directly sequenced. ETFDH deficiencies affected 94.1% (48/51) of the pedigrees. ETFDH-c.250G>A is the most common mutation, representing a high allelic frequency of 83.3% (80/96). Carrier frequency of c.250G>A is estimated to be 1.35% (7/520) in the normal population. A significant reduced expression of ETFDH was identified in the muscle of ETFDH-deficient patients. ETFDH deficiency is a major cause of riboflavin-responsive MADD in southern China, and c.250G>A is an important mutation that could be employed as a fast and reliable screening method.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Muscles must maintain cell compartmentalization when remodeled during development and use. How spatially restricted adhesions are regulated with muscle remodeling is largely unexplored. We show that the myotubularin (mtm) phosphoinositide phosphatase is required for integrin-mediated myofiber attachments in Drosophila melanogaster, and that mtm-depleted myofibers exhibit hallmarks of human XLMTM myopathy. Depletion of mtm leads to increased integrin turnover at the sarcolemma and an accumulation of integrin with PI(3)P on endosomal-related membrane inclusions, indicating a role for Mtm phosphatase activity in endocytic trafficking. The depletion of Class II, but not Class III, PI3-kinase rescued mtm-dependent defects, identifying an important pathway that regulates integrin recycling. Importantly, similar integrin localization defects found in human XLMTM myofibers signify conserved MTM1 function in muscle membrane trafficking. Our results indicate that regulation of distinct phosphoinositide pools plays a central role in maintaining cell compartmentalization and attachments during muscle remodeling, and they suggest involvement of Class II PI3-kinase in MTM-related disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: A recessively transmitted fatal hypertonic infantile muscular dystrophy has been described in Canadian aboriginals. The affected infants present with progressive limb and axial muscle stiffness and develop severe respiratory insufficiency, and most die in the first year of life. We sought to determine the genetic basis of this disease. METHODS: We performed histochemical, immunocytochemical, electron microscopy, and molecular genetic studies in a cohort of 12 patients affected by this disease. RESULTS: Conventional histochemical and electron microscopy studies suggested myofibrillar myopathy (MFM). Therefore, we searched for ectopic expression of multiple proteins typical of MFM. Alpha B-crystallin (αBC) expression was absent from all fibers using a monoclonal antibody raised against the entire protein. However, a monoclonal antibody directed against the first 10 residues of αBC immunostained portions of abnormal fibers. Pursuing this clue, we searched for mutations in the gene for αBC (CRYAB) in available DNA samples of 8 patients. All harbored a homozygous deletion, c.60C, predicting a Ser to Ala change at codon 21 and a stop codon after 23 missense residues (p.Ser21AlafsX24). Clinically unaffected parents were heterozygous for this mutation. INTERPRETATION: The homozygous c.60delC in CRYAB pinpoints the genetic basis of the fatal infantile hypertonic muscular dystrophy of Canadian aboriginals. MFMs are typically transmitted by dominant inheritance, but in this disease the parental phenotype is rescued by limited expression of the highly truncated nonfunctional mutant gene product. The severe patient phenotype is due to homozygosity for the markedly hypomorphic allele. Ann Neurol, 2011.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Small heat shock proteins form large cytosolic assemblies from an "α-crystallin domain" (ACD) flanked by sequence extensions. Mutation of a conserved arginine in the ACD of several human small heat shock protein family members causes many common inherited diseases of the lens and neuromuscular system. The mutation R120G in αB-crystallin causes myopathy, cardiomyopathy and cataract. We have solved the X-ray structure of the excised ACD dimer of human αB R120G close to physiological pH and compared it with several recently determined wild-type vertebrate ACD dimer structures. Wild-type excised ACD dimers have a deep groove at the interface floored by a flat extended "bottom sheet." Solid-state NMR studies of large assemblies of full-length αB-crystallin have shown that the groove is blocked in the ACD dimer by curvature of the bottom sheet. The crystal structure of R120G ACD dimer also reveals a closed groove, but here the bottom sheet is flat. Loss of Arg120 results in rearrangement of an extensive array of charged interactions across this interface. His83 and Asp80 on movable arches on either side of the interface close the groove by forming two new salt bridges. The residues involved in this extended set of ionic interactions are conserved in Hsp27, Hsp20, αA- and αB-crystallin sequences. They are not conserved in Hsp22, where mutation of the equivalent of Arg120 causes neuropathy. We speculate that the αB R120G mutation disturbs oligomer dynamics, causing the growth of large soluble oligomers that are toxic to cells by blocking essential processes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Quadriceps myopathy (QM) is a rare form of muscle disease characterized by pathological changes predominately localized to the quadriceps. Although numerous inheritance patterns have been implicated in QM, several QM patients harbor deletions in dystrophin. Two defined deletions predicted loss of functional spectrin-like repeats 17 and 18. Spectrin-like repeat 17 participates in actin-filament binding, and thus we hypothesized that disruption of a dystrophin-cytoplasmic actin interaction might be one of the mechanisms underlying QM. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice deficient for β(cyto)-actin in skeletal muscles (Actb-msKO). Actb-msKO mice presented with a progressive increase in the proportion of centrally nucleated fibers in the quadriceps, an approximately 50% decrease in dystrophin protein expression without alteration in transcript levels, deficits in repeated maximal treadmill tests, and heightened sensitivity to eccentric contractions. Collectively, these results suggest that perturbing a dystrophin-β(cyto)-actin linkage decreases dystrophin stability, which results in a QM, and implicates β(cyto)-actin as a possible candidate gene in QM pathology.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Missense mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene on chromosome 9p13.3-p12 cause inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (hereafter referred to as IBMPFD; OMIM 167320). OBJECTIVE: To describe detailed clinical, electrophysiological, biochemical, and neuroimaging findings in IBMPFD linked to VCP p.Arg155Cys in a Korean family. DESIGN: Case series. Clinical, electrophysiological, biochemical, and neuroimaging findings were obtained by direct evaluation and from previous medical records. SETTING: Tertiary referral hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Three affected family members in a Korean family. RESULTS: The clinical features of myopathy, Paget disease of bone, and semantic dementia (a clinical subtype of frontotemporal dementia) in our patients were similar to those of previously reported cases. However, the brain magnetic resonance imaging features in our patients, including asymmetric anterior and lateral temporal and inferior parietal atrophy with ventricular dilatation on the affected side, differed from those of previously published features in patients with IBMPFD and in patients with typical semantic dementia who show anterior temporal and frontal atrophy. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this report provides the first documented IBMPFD family in Asia and broadens the phenotypic spectrum of VCP mutation-associated frontotemporal dementia.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the four and a half LIM protein 1 (FHL1) gene were recently identified as the cause of four distinct skeletal muscle diseases. Since the initial report outlining the first fhl1 mutation in 2008, over 25 different mutations have been identified in patients with reducing body myopathy, X-linked myopathy characterized by postural muscle atrophy, scapuloperoneal myopathy and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Reducing body myopathy was first described four decades ago, its underlying genetic cause was unknown until the discovery of fhl1 mutations. X-linked myopathy characterized by postural muscle atrophy is a novel disease where fhl1 mutations are the only cause. This review will profile each of the FHL1, with a comprehensive analysis of mutations, a comparison of the clinical and histopathological features and will present several hypotheses for the possible disease mechanism(s).</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Inclusion body myopathy with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is caused by mutations in Valosin-containing protein (VCP), a hexameric AAA ATPase that participates in a variety of cellular processes such as protein degradation, organelle biogenesis, and cell-cycle regulation. To understand how VCP mutations cause IBMPFD, we have established a Drosophila model by overexpressing TER94 (the sole Drosophila VCP ortholog) carrying mutations analogous to those implicated in IBMPFD. Expression of these TER94 mutants in muscle and nervous systems causes tissue degeneration, recapitulating the pathogenic phenotypes in IBMPFD patients. TER94-induced neurodegenerative defects are enhanced by elevated expression of wild-type TER94, suggesting that the pathogenic alleles are dominant active mutations. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that TER94-induced neurodegenerative defects require the formation of hexamer complex, a prerequisite for a functional AAA ATPase. Surprisingly, while disruptions of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) have been implicated as causes for VCP-induced tissue degeneration, these processes are not significantly affected in our fly model. Instead, the neurodegenerative defect of TER94 mutants seems sensitive to the level of cellular ATP. We show that increasing cellular ATP by independent mechanisms could suppress the phenotypes of TER94 mutants. Conversely, decreasing cellular ATP would enhance the TER94 mutant phenotypes. Taken together, our analyses have defined the nature of IBMPFD-causing VCP mutations and made an unexpected link between cellular ATP level and IBMPFD pathogenesis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>This study aimed to identify the genetic defect in a multigenerational family presenting an autosomal dominant myopathy with histological features of congenital fiber type disproportion. Linkage analysis and genetic sequencing identified, in all affected members of the family, the c.5807A>G heterozygous mutation in MYH7, which encodes the slow/β-cardiac myosin heavy chain. This mutation causes skeletal but not cardiac involvement. Myosin heavy chain expression pattern was also characterized by immunohistochemistry, western blot and q-PCR in muscle biopsies from two patients aged 25 and 62, respectively. While only congenital fiber type disproportion was observed in the younger patient, older patient's biopsy presented aggregates of slow myosin heavy chains, in fiber sub-sarcolemmal region. These clinico-pathologic findings suggest a novel phenotype within the emerging group of hereditary myosin myopathies, which in this family presents typical characteristics of congenital fiber type disproportion in early stages and later evolves to myosin storage myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a congenital disorder caused by deficiency of the lipid phosphatase, myotubularin. Patients with XLMTM often have severe perinatal weakness that requires mechanical ventilation to prevent death from respiratory failure. Muscle biopsy specimens from patients with XLMTM exhibit small myofibers with central nuclei and central aggregations of organelles in many cells. It was postulated that therapeutically increasing muscle fiber size would cause symptomatic improvement in myotubularin deficiency. Recent studies have elucidated an important role for the activin-receptor type IIB (ActRIIB) in regulation of muscle growth and have demonstrated that ActRIIB inhibition results in significant muscle hypertrophy. To evaluate whether promoting muscle hypertrophy can attenuate symptoms resulting from myotubularin deficiency, the effect of ActRIIB-mFC treatment was determined in myotubularin-deficient (Mtm1δ4) mice. Compared with wild-type mice, untreated Mtm1δ4 mice have decreased body weight, skeletal muscle hypotrophy, and reduced survival. Treatment of Mtm1δ4 mice with ActRIIB-mFC produced a 17% extension of lifespan, with transient increases in weight, forelimb grip strength, and myofiber size. Pathologic analysis of Mtm1δ4 mice during treatment revealed that ActRIIB-mFC produced marked hypertrophy restricted to type 2b myofibers, which suggests that oxidative fibers in Mtm1δ4 animals are incapable of a hypertrophic response in this setting. These results support ActRIIB-mFC as an effective treatment for the weakness observed in myotubularin deficiency.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Laing early-onset distal myopathy is a rare autosomal dominant myopathy and caused by mutations in the MYH7 gene, encoding the slow beta myosin heavy chain. We report the first molecularly verified Laing distal myopathy in a French family caused by a novel p.Glu1508del mutation in the MYH7 gene. Interestingly, we identified the identical mutation in an unrelated Norwegian family and, as a de novo mutation, in one sporadic Finnish patient. Described in detail are the clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of 5 patients from the French family. The phenotype in the Finnish patient and the Norwegian patients is largely similar. This mutation causes a benign myopathy within the range of previously reported Laing myopathy phenotype variations. Onset of weakness in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles occurred in early childhood in all patients. Finger extensor and neck flexor weakness together with Achilles tendon retractions were other frequent findings. The independent recurrence of the identical mutation without any founder background may reflect a mutational susceptibility of this residue, in accordance with some other MYH7 mutations previously reported. De novo mutations seem to be frequent in Laing distal myopathy. This is of clinical importance since a dominant family history is missing, which may confuse differential diagnostic efforts.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), palliative glucocorticoid therapy can produce myopathy or calcification. Since increased nitric oxide synthase activity in dystrophic mice promotes regeneration, the outcome of two nitric oxide (NO) donor drugs, MyoNovin (M) and isosorbide dinitrate (I), on the effectiveness of the anti-inflammatory drug prednisone (P) in alleviating progression of dystrophy was tested. Dystrophic mdx mice were treated (18 days) as controls or with an NO donor ± P. Fiber permeability and DNA synthesis were labeled by Evans blue dye (EBD) and bromodeoxyuridine uptake, respectively. P decreased body weight gain, M increased quadriceps mass, and I increased heart mass. P increased fiber permeability (%EBD+ fibers) and calcification in diaphragm. Treatment with NO donors + P (M+P, I+P) reduced %EBD+ fibers and calcification vs. P alone. %EBD+ fibers in M+P diaphragm did not differ from control. NO donor treatment reduced proliferation and the population of c-met+ cells and accelerated fiber regeneration. Concurrent with P, NO donor treatment suppressed two important detrimental effects of P in mice, possibly by accelerating regeneration, rebalancing satellite cell quiescence and activation in dystrophy, and/or increasing perfusion. Results suggest that NO donors could improve current therapy for DMD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Previously, we identified valosin-containing protein (VCP) as a mediator of ER stress-induced cell death. Mutations in the VCP gene including R93, R155, and R191 have been described that manifest clinically as hereditary inclusion body myopathy with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia. In addition, other studies have demonstrated that as a consequence of a mutation generated in the second ATP binding domain of VCP (K524A), cells accumulated large cytoplasmic vacuoles and underwent programmed cell death. In order to better understand the biochemical and molecular consequences of the clinically relevant VCP mutations as well as the genetically engineered ATPase-inactive mutant K524A and any relationship these may have to ER stress-induced cell death, we introduced analogous mutations separately and together into the human VCP gene and evaluated their effect on proteasome activity, Huntingtin protein aggregation and ER stress-induced cell death. Our results indicate that the VCP K524A mutant and the triple mutant VCP R93C-R155C-K524A block protein degradation, trigger Huntingtin aggregate formation, and render cells highly susceptible to ER stress-induced cell death as compared to VCPWT or other VCP mutants.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The importance of membrane transporters for drug pharmacokinetics has been increasingly recognized during the last decade. Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) is a genetically polymorphic influx transporter expressed on the sinusoidal membrane of human hepatocytes, and it mediates the hepatic uptake of many endogenous compounds and xenobiotics. Recent studies have demonstrated that OATP1B1 plays a major, clinically important role in the hepatic uptake of many drugs. A common single-nucleotide variation (coding DNA c.521T>C, protein p.V174A, rs4149056) in the SLCO1B1 gene encoding OATP1B1 decreases the transporting activity of OATP1B1, resulting in markedly increased plasma concentrations of, for example, many statins, particularly of active simvastatin acid. The variant thereby enhances the risk of statin-induced myopathy and decreases the therapeutic indexes of statins. However, the effect of the SLCO1B1 c.521T>C variant is different on different statins. The same variant also markedly affects the pharmacokinetics of several other drugs. Furthermore, certain SLCO1B1 variants associated with an enhanced clearance of methotrexate increase the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity by methotrexate in the treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Certain drugs (e.g., cyclosporine) potently inhibit OATP1B1, causing clinically significant drug interactions. Thus, OATP1B1 plays a major role in the hepatic uptake of drugs, and genetic variants and drug interactions affecting OATP1B1 activity are important determinants of individual drug responses. In this article, we review the current knowledge about the expression, function, substrate characteristics, and pharmacogenetics of OATP1B1 as well as its role in drug interactions, in parts comparing with those of other hepatocyte-expressed organic anion transporting polypeptides, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Statins reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in appropriately selected patients. However, statin-associated myopathy is a significant risk associated with these agents. Recently, variation in the SLCO1B1 gene was reported to predict simvastatin-associated myopathy. The aim of this study was to replicate association of the rs4149056 variant in SLCO1B1 with severe statin-associated myopathy in a cohort of patients using a variety of statin medications and to investigate the association with specific statin types. We identified 25 cases of severe statin-associated myopathy and 84 controls matched for age, gender, statin type and dose. The rs4149056 variant in SLCO1B1 was not significantly associated with myopathy in this group as a whole. However, when subjects were stratified by statin type, the SLCO1B1 rs4149056 genotype was significantly associated with myopathy in patients who received simvastatin, but not in patients who received atorvastatin. Our findings provide further support for a role for SLCO1B1 genotype in simvastatin-associated myopathy, and suggest that this association may be stronger for simvastatin compared with atorvastatin.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Autosomal-dominant centronuclear myopathy (CNM) due to mutations in the dynamin 2 gene (DNM2) is a rare congenital myopathy histopathologically characterized by centrally located nuclei and a radial arrangement of sarcoplasmic strands around the central nuclei. A total of 1,582 consecutive muscle biopsies of adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) were screened for morphologically characteristic signs of CNM. Patients with CNM were screened for mutations in DNM2. Clinical data and complementary neurophysiologic, respiratory, cardiac, and muscle MRI data in these patients were analyzed. Six index patients had histopathological signs of CNM (0.38%). Three had the heterozygous p.R465W and 2 siblings the heterozygous p.E368K DNM2 mutation. In 2 patients mutational screening for DNM2, BIN1, MTM1, and RYR1 was negative. Apart from the siblings, there was no positive history, parental mutation screening in 2 cases was negative. Both the percentage of muscle fibers with centralized nuclei and the ratio of muscle fibers with centralized to internalized nuclei were higher in DNM2-CNM compared to non-DNM2-CNM (50% vs. 18% and 94% vs. 63%). The onset was already neonatal or in infancy in 3/5 patients with DNM2 mutation. Symptoms in DNM2-CNM included bilateral ptosis (n = 3), paresis of the external ocular muscles (n = 2), axonal neuropathy (n = 4), restrictive ventilatory involvement (n = 5), and contractures (n = 5), including muscular torticollis (n = 1) and masticatory muscles (n = 2). DNM2-CNM patients and non-DNM2-CNM patients could not be distinguished by clinical features. DNM2-CNM often shows de novo mutations. In addition to the feature of radial sarcoplasmic strands, the ratio of centrally to internalized nuclei might help to differentiate DNM2-CNM from other forms of CNM. Other genes than currently known seem to cause the clinical and histopathological phenotype of CNM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The active form of vitamin D, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3), is critical for the regulation of serum calcium and phosphorus levels that in turn support bone mineralization and neuromuscular activity. It is well known that vitamin D deficiency causes rachitic/osteomalacic myopathy and cardiac disorder and the provision of vitamin D can reverse the symptoms. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The question of whether the vitamin D receptor is found in muscle has been debated but not settled. We recently studied all available antibodies against the vitamin D receptor and found that most antibodies used detect proteins other than the vitamin D receptor, and therefore, the utility of these antibodies may generate the false-positive results. Using antibodies that do not detect proteins in tissues from vitamin D receptor null mice, we have developed a specific and sensitive immunohistochemical assay. The results from this investigation show that the vitamin D receptor is undetectable in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle, suggesting that the function of vitamin D on muscle is either of an indirect nature or does not involve the known receptor.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>PGC-1α is a transcriptional co-activator that plays a central role in the regulation of energy metabolism. Our interest in this protein was driven by its ability to promote muscle remodeling. Conversion from fast glycolytic to slow oxidative fibers seemed a promising therapeutic approach in Pompe disease, a severe myopathy caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) which is responsible for the degradation of glycogen. The recently approved enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has only a partial effect in skeletal muscle. In our Pompe mouse model (KO), the poor muscle response is seen in fast but not in slow muscle and is associated with massive accumulation of autophagic debris and ineffective autophagy. In an attempt to turn the therapy-resistant fibers into fibers amenable to therapy, we made transgenic KO mice expressing PGC-1α in muscle (tgKO). The successful switch from fast to slow fibers prevented the formation of autophagic buildup in the converted fibers, but PGC-1α failed to improve the clearance of glycogen by ERT. This outcome is likely explained by an unexpected dramatic increase in muscle glycogen load to levels much closer to those observed in patients, in particular infants, with the disease. We have also found a remarkable rise in the number of lysosomes and autophagosomes in the tgKO compared to the KO. These data point to the role of PGC-1α in muscle glucose metabolism and its possible role as a master regulator for organelle biogenesis - not only for mitochondria but also for lysosomes and autophagosomes. These findings may have implications for therapy of lysosomal diseases and other disorders with altered autophagy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVES: To determine whether type 1 interferon (IFN) proteins in blood are associated with downstream type 1 IFN-inducible gene expression in blood from patients with myositis. METHODS: IFNα, IFNβ and IFNω concentrations were measured by ELISA in 129 blood samples (from 93 patients with dermatomyositis (DM), inclusion body myositis, polymyositis and other muscle diseases and from 36 healthy volunteers). Their concentrations were correlated with their ability to stimulate type 1 IFN-inducible gene transcription in a functional assay for 123 of these samples and the type 1 IFN-inducible blood gene expression from 70 of the same samples. RESULTS: Blood IFNβ concentration was uniquely associated with DM (p=0.0004), detectable in 64% of samples from patients with untreated or minimally treated DM and 35% of all DM samples compared with 6% of other inflammatory myopathy and 6% of healthy volunteer samples. Blood IFNβ, but not IFNα or IFNω, correlated with high blood type 1 IFN-inducible gene expression (p=0.01). Healthy volunteer samples with a high ELISA signal for IFNα and IFNω lacked functional bioassay activity and such a signal was confirmed as artefactual. CONCLUSION: Elevated blood IFNβ protein concentration is associated with DM. Systemic and local production of IFNβ might contribute to, but may not fully explain, the marked overproduction of type 1 IFN-inducible transcripts and proteins seen in DM muscle and blood.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the plectin gene (PLEC1) cause epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), which may associate with muscular dystrophy (EBS-MD) or pyloric atresia (EBS-PA). The association of EBS with congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) is also suspected to result from PLEC1 mutations. We report here a consanguineous patient with EBS and CMS for whom mutational analysis of PLEC1 revealed a homozygous 36 nucleotide insertion (1506_1507ins36) that results in a reduced expression of PLEC1 mRNA and plectin in the patient muscle. In addition, mutational analysis of CHRNE revealed a homozygous 1293insG, which is a well-known low-expressor receptor mutation. A skin biopsy revealed signs of EBS, and an anconeus muscle biopsy showed signs of a mild myopathy. Endplate studies showed fragmentation of endplates, postsynaptic simplification, and large collections of thread-like mitochondria. Amplitudes of miniature endplate potentials were diminished, but the endplate quantal content was actually increased. The complex phenotype presented here results from mutations in two separate genes. While the skin manifestations are because of the PLEC1 mutation, footprints of mutations in PLEC1 and CHRNE are present at the neuromuscular junction of the patient indicating that abnormalities in both genes contribute to the CMS phenotype.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the dysferlin gene cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2B and Miyoshi myopathy (MM), which are collectively named dysferlinopathy. Dysferlinopathy is the most frequent type of LGMD in the Japanese population. Molecular genetic analysis is essential for the diagnosis of dysferlinopathy because of its variable immunohistochemical patterns of biopsied muscles, including patterns similar to normal controls. The analysis of the entire dysferlin gene however, is time-consuming and laborious; therefore a simple and rapid screening method to detect hot spot mutations in the dysferlin gene is essential for the diagnosis of dysferlinopathy. METHODS: We previously showed that 4 mutations, c.937+1G>A, c.1566C>G, c.2997G>T and c.3373delG account for 50% of all the mutations identified in Japanese dysferlinopathy patients. We performed a one-tube multiplex PCR, followed by extension of primers for each mutation with a fluorescence-labeled dideoxynucleotide to screen the 4 hot spot mutations. RESULTS: The multiplex primer-extension reaction was developed on samples of known mutations. The extension products were represented as 4 different peaks that corresponded to a mutated nucleotide on electropherogram. Using the developed screening method, we were able to detect mutations in these hot spots in 3 samples out of 8 clinically suspected LGMD2B/MM patients in only approximately 8 hours. These 3 cases were definitely diagnosed as LGMD2B/MM by exonic sequencing. CONCLUSION: We have developed a simple and rapid screening method which could facilitate the definitive diagnosis of dysferlinopathy, contributing to an understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlations for dysferlinopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Recent studies demonstrated a strong influence of rare genetic variants on several lipid-related traits. However, their impact on free fatty acid (FFA) plasma concentrations, as well as the role of rare variants in a general population, has not yet been thoroughly addressed. The adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is encoded by the PNPLA2 gene and catalyzes the rate-limiting step of lipolysis. It represents a prominent candidate gene affecting FFA concentrations. We therefore screened the full genomic region of ATGL for mutations in 1,473 randomly selected individuals from the SAPHIR (Salzburg Atherosclerosis Prevention program in subjects at High Individual Risk) Study using a combined Ecotilling and sequencing approach and functionally investigated all detected protein variants by in-vitro studies. We observed 55 novel mostly rare genetic variants in this general population sample. Biochemical evaluation of all non-synonymous variants demonstrated the presence of several mutated but mostly still functional ATGL alleles with largely varying residual lipolytic activity. About one-quarter (3 out of 13) of the investigated variants presented a marked decrease or total loss of catalytic function. Genetic association studies using both continuous and dichotomous approaches showed a shift towards lower plasma FFA concentrations for rare variant carriers and an accumulation of variants in the lower 10%-quantile of the FFA distribution. However, the generally rather small effects suggest either only a secondary role of rare ATGL variants on the FFA levels in the SAPHIR population or a recessive action of ATGL variants. In contrast to these rather small effects, we describe here also the first patient with "neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy" (NLSDM) with a point mutation in the catalytic dyad, but otherwise intact protein.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hereditary myopathy with lactic acidosis (HML) is caused by an intron mutation in the iron-sulphur cluster assembly gene (ISCU) leading to incorporation of intron sequence into the mRNA. This results in a deficiency of Fe-S cluster proteins, affecting the TCA cycle and the respiratory chain. The proteins involved in the Fe-S machinery are evolutionary conserved and shown to be fundamental in all organisms examined. ISCU is expressed at high levels in numerous tissues in mammals, including high metabolic tissues like the heart, suggesting that a drastic mutation in the ISCU gene would be damaging to all energy-demanding organs. In spite of this, the symptoms in patients with HML are restricted to skeletal muscle, and it has been proposed that splicing events may contribute to the muscle specificity. In this study we confirm that a striking difference in the splicing pattern of mutant ISCU exists between different tissues. The highest level of incorrectly spliced ISCU mRNA was found in skeletal muscle, while the normal splice form predominated in patient heart. The splicing differences were also reflected at a functional level, where loss of Fe-S cluster carrying enzymes and accumulation of iron were present in muscle, but absent in other tissues. We also show that complete loss of ISCU in mice results in early embryonic death. The mice data confirm a fundamental role for ISCU in mammals and further support tissue-specific splicing as the major mechanism limiting the phenotype to skeletal muscle in HML.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Danon disease is an X-linked lysosomal disorder, characterized by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy and mental retardation. We report a family with a novel mutation, in which the mother and her three sons were affected with various clinical presentations. A massive hypertrophy of the left ventricle was the predominant feature in the three male patients, with different degrees of severity of cardiac symptoms, from isolated palpitations to cardiac failure and sudden death. Muscle pain and weakness were also variable, but constantly associated with increased plasma CK levels. Finally, the male patients had variable degree of a mental retardation. The mother had an attenuated phenotype, limited to a mild hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with premature ventricular contractions diagnosed during her 40's. Microscopy examination of skeletal muscle biopsy, performed in the youngest patient, demonstrated atrophic myofibers with intracytoplasmic vacuoles suggesting lysosomal glycogen storage disease. Immunohistochemistry analyses in muscle specimen showed no detectable Lysosomal-Associated Membrane Protein-2 (LAMP-2), in keeping with the diagnosis of Danon disease. However, a very low expression of a shortened LAMP-2 protein could be evidenced by Western-blot in the patient's fibroblasts. Molecular investigations identified a novel splicing mutation (IVS6 + 1delG) in the LAMP-2 gene. This case report highlights the intrafamilial variability of Danon disease phenotype. In this case, morphological examination of muscle biopsy, showing lysosomal storage myopathy, and immunohistochemistry analyses can provide key elements for orienting etiologic investigations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH) has emerged as an important factor in setting the redox status of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. An important role of H6PDH is to generate a high NADPH/NADP(+) ratio which permits 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) to act as an oxo-reductase, catalyzing the activation of glucocorticoids (GCs). In H6PDH knockout mice 11β-HSD1 assumes dehydrogenase activity and inactivates GCs, rendering the target cell relatively GC insensitive. Consequently, H6PDHKO mice have a phenotype consistent with defects in the permissive and adaptive actions of GCs upon physiology. H6PDHKO mice have also offered an insight into muscle physiology as they also present with a severe vacuolating myopathy, abnormalities of glucose homeostasis and activation of the unfolded protein response due to ER stress, and a number of mechanisms driving this phenotype are thought to be involved. This article will review what we understand of the redox control of GC hormone metabolism regulated by H6PDH, and how H6PDHKO mice have allowed an in-depth understanding of its potentially novel, GC-independent roles in muscle physiology.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Using exome sequencing, we identified a p.R191Q amino acid change in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene in an Italian family with autosomal dominantly inherited amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mutations in VCP have previously been identified in families with Inclusion Body Myopathy, Paget disease, and Frontotemporal Dementia (IBMPFD). Screening of VCP in a cohort of 210 familial ALS cases and 78 autopsy-proven ALS cases identified four additional mutations including a p.R155H mutation in a pathologically proven case of ALS. VCP protein is essential for maturation of ubiquitin-containing autophagosomes, and mutant VCP toxicity is partially mediated through its effect on TDP-43 protein, a major constituent of ubiquitin inclusions that neuropathologically characterize ALS. Our data broaden the phenotype of IBMPFD to include motor neuron degeneration, suggest that VCP mutations may account for ∼1%-2% of familial ALS, and provide evidence directly implicating defects in the ubiquitination/protein degradation pathway in motor neuron degeneration.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Muscle contraction relies on a highly organized intracellular network of membrane organelles and cytoskeleton proteins. Among the latter are the intermediate filaments (IFs), a large family of proteins mutated in more than 30 human diseases. For example, mutations in the DES gene, which encodes the IF desmin, lead to desmin-related myopathy and cardiomyopathy. Here, we demonstrate that myotubularin (MTM1), which is mutated in individuals with X-linked centronuclear myopathy (XLCNM; also known as myotubular myopathy), is a desmin-binding protein and provide evidence for direct regulation of desmin by MTM1 in vitro and in vivo. XLCNM-causing mutations in MTM1 disrupted the MTM1-desmin complex, resulting in abnormal IF assembly and architecture in muscle cells and both mouse and human skeletal muscles. Adeno-associated virus-mediated ectopic expression of WT MTM1 in Mtm1-KO muscle reestablished normal desmin expression and localization. In addition, decreased MTM1 expression and XLCNM-causing mutations induced abnormal mitochondrial positioning, shape, dynamics, and function. We therefore conclude that MTM1 is a major regulator of both the desmin cytoskeleton and mitochondria homeostasis, specifically in skeletal muscle. Defects in IF stabilization and mitochondrial dynamics appear as common physiopathological features of centronuclear myopathies and desmin-related myopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Homozygous mutations in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene cause hereditary inclusion body myopathy type 2 (HIBM2). We describe two unrelated American patients with novel GNE mutations. While one patient followed a typical disease course for HIBM2 with an onset at age 25 and rimmed vacuole pathology on muscle biopsy, the second patient had several features atypical for HIBM2. This patient's onset was at age 55, included distal weakness, quadriceps sparing and respiratory insufficiency. His muscle biopsy showed prominent necrosis without rimmed vacuoles. This study expands the phenotype and illustrates the clinical spectrum of HIBM2 identified in a U.S. based neuromuscular clinic.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Centronuclear myopathies (CNM) describe a group of rare muscle diseases typically presenting an abnormal positioning of nuclei in muscle fibers. To date, three genes are known to be associated to a classical CNM phenotype. The X-linked neonatal form (XLCNM) is due to mutations in MTM1 and involves a severe and generalized muscle weakness at birth. The autosomal dominant form results from DNM2 mutations and has been described with early childhood and adult onset (ADCNM). Autosomal recessive centronuclear myopathy (ARCNM) is less characterized and has recently been associated to mutations in BIN1, encoding amphiphysin 2. Here we present the first clinical description of intrafamilal variability in two first-degree cousins with a novel BIN1 stop mutation. In addition to skeletal muscle defects, both patients have mild mental retardation and the more severely affected male also displays abnormal ventilation and cardiac arrhythmia, thus expanding the phenotypic spectrum of BIN1-related CNM to non skeletal muscle defects. We provide an up-to-date review of all previous cases with ARCNM and BIN1 mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlin (DYSF) is a type II transmembrane protein implicated in surface membrane repair of muscle. Mutations in dysferlin lead to Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B), Miyoshi Myopathy (MM), and Distal Myopathy with Anterior Tibialis onset (DMAT). The DYSF protein complex is not well understood, and only a few protein-binding partners have been identified thus far. To increase the set of interacting protein partners for DYSF we recovered a list of predicted interacting protein through a systems biology approach. The predictions are part of a "reverse-engineered" genome-wide human gene regulatory network obtained from experimental data by computational analysis. The reverse-engineering algorithm behind the analysis relates genes to each other based on changes in their expression patterns. DYSF and AHNAK were used to query the system and extract lists of potential interacting proteins. Among the 32 predictions the two genes share, we validated the physical interaction between DYSF protein with moesin (MSN) and polymerase I and transcript release factor (PTRF) in mouse heart lysate, thus identifying two novel Dysferlin-interacting proteins. Our strategy could be useful to clarify Dysferlin function in intracellular vesicles and its implication in muscle membrane resealing.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We identified a member of the BTB/Kelch protein family that is mutated in nemaline myopathy type 6 (NEM6), an autosomal-dominant neuromuscular disorder characterized by the presence of nemaline rods and core lesions in the skeletal myofibers. Analysis of affected families allowed narrowing of the candidate region on chromosome 15q22.31, and mutation screening led to the identification of a previously uncharacterized gene, KBTBD13, coding for a hypothetical protein and containing missense mutations that perfectly cosegregate with nemaline myopathy in the studied families. KBTBD13 contains a BTB/POZ domain and five Kelch repeats and is expressed primarily in skeletal and cardiac muscle. The identified disease-associated mutations, C.742C>A (p.Arg248Ser), c.1170G>C (p.Lys390Asn), and c.1222C>T (p.Arg408Cys), located in conserved domains of Kelch repeats, are predicted to disrupt the molecule's beta-propeller blades. Previously identified BTB/POZ/Kelch-domain-containing proteins have been implicated in a broad variety of biological processes, including cytoskeleton modulation, regulation of gene transcription, ubiquitination, and myofibril assembly. The functional role of KBTBD13 in skeletal muscle and the pathogenesis of NEM6 are subjects for further studies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) metabolism by the enzyme hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PDH) within the sarcoplasmic reticulum lumen generates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced) to provide the redox potential for the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) to activate glucocorticoid (GC). H6PDH knockout (KO) mice have a switch in 11β-HSD1 activity, resulting in GC inactivation and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation. Importantly, H6PDHKO mice develop a type II fiber myopathy with abnormalities in glucose metabolism and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). GCs play important roles in muscle physiology, and therefore, we have examined the importance of 11β-HSD1 and GC metabolism in mediating aspects of the H6PDHKO myopathy. To achieve this, we examined 11β-HSD1/H6PDH double-KO (DKO) mice, in which 11β-HSD1 mediated GC inactivation is negated. In contrast to H6PDHKO mice, DKO mice GC metabolism and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis set point is similar to that observed in 11β-HSD1KO mice. Critically, in contrast to 11β-HSD1KO mice, DKO mice phenocopy the salient features of the H6PDHKO, displaying reduced body mass, muscle atrophy, and vacuolation of type II fiber-rich muscle, fasting hypoglycemia, increased muscle glycogen deposition, and elevated expression of UPR genes. We propose that muscle G6P metabolism through H6PDH may be as important as changes in the redox environment when considering the mechanism underlying the activation of the UPR and the ensuing myopathy in H6PDHKO and DKO mice. These data are consistent with an 11β-HSD1-independent function for H6PDH in which sarcoplasmic reticulum G6P metabolism and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-(oxidized)/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced) redox status are important for maintaining muscle homeostasis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Desmin-related myopathy (DRM) is known to cause different types of cardiomyopathy. Late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has been shown to identify fibrosis in ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies. We present a rare case of desmin-related hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, CMR revealed fibrosis in the lateral wall of the left ventricle. CMR is superior to conventional echocardiography for the detection of myocardial fibrosis in desmin-related cardiomyopathy, which may be useful to detect early cardiac involvement and predict the patient prognosis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy (NLSDM) is a type of lipid storage myopathy arising due to a mutation in the PNPLA2 gene encoding an adipose triglyceride lipase responsible for the degradation of intracellular triglycerides. Herein, we report the cases of two siblings manifesting slowly progressive proximal and distal limb weakness in adulthood. One of the patients had dilated cardiomyopathy, hearing loss and short stature. Muscle specimens of the 2 patients revealed muscular dystrophic features with massive lipid droplets and numerous rimmed vacuoles in the fibers. A novel homozygous mutation IVS2+1G > A in the PNPLA2 gene was identified in the 2 cases, but not in the healthy familial individuals. The presence of massive lipid droplets with muscular dystrophic changes and rimmed vacuoles in muscle fibers might be one of the characteristic pathological changes of NLSDM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>AIMS: To report the clinical, pathological and genetic findings in a group of patients with a previously not described phenotype of congenital myopathy due to recessive mutations in the gene encoding the type 1 muscle ryanodine receptor channel (RYR1). METHODS: Seven unrelated patients shared a predominant axial and proximal weakness of varying severity, with onset during the neonatal period, associated with bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoparesis, and unusual muscle biopsy features at light and electron microscopic levels. RESULTS: Muscle biopsy histochemistry revealed a peculiar morphological pattern characterized by numerous internalized myonuclei in up to 51% of fibres and large areas of myofibrillar disorganization with undefined borders. Ultrastructurally, such areas frequently occupied the whole myofibre cross section and extended to a moderate number of sarcomeres in length. Molecular genetic investigations identified recessive mutations in the ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene in six compound heterozygous patients and one homozygous patient. Nine mutations are novel and four have already been reported either as pathogenic recessive mutations or as changes affecting a residue associated with dominant malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. Only two mutations were located in the C-terminal transmembrane domain whereas the others were distributed throughout the cytoplasmic region of RyR1. CONCLUSION: Our data enlarge the spectrum of RYR1 mutations and highlight their clinical and morphological heterogeneity. A congenital myopathy featuring ptosis and external ophthalmoplegia, concomitant with the novel histopathological phenotype showing fibres with large, poorly delimited areas of myofibrillar disorganization and internal nuclei, is highly suggestive of an RYR1-related congenital myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In mammals, collagen XV is primarily expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles, and loss of its expression in mice results in a mild skeletal myopathy. We recently identified Col15a1a, a zebrafish ortholog of the human collagen XV gene which expression was restricted to notochord in embryos. Col15a1a knockdown led to defects in muscle maintenance via Shh signaling. Here we report that zebrafish express a second ortholog Col15a1b. The identification of its complete primary sequence showed that the overall structure of collagen XV is well conserved between vertebrates. Whole mount in situ hybridization and RT-PCR analysis revealed that at 12hpf Col15a1b is mainly expressed in slow muscle cell lineage and in nervous tissues, and, at later stages transcripts are detected in eyes, otic placodes and aortic arches. Based on the expression pattern of col15a1b, sequence alignments and synteny comparisons, we conclude that, contrary to collagen XVa, the zebrafish collagen XVb likely displays the same or similar function than the mammalian orthologs.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Autophagy is crucial in the turnover of cell components, and clearance of damaged organelles by the autophagic-lysosomal pathway is essential for tissue homeostasis. Defects of this degradative system have a role in various diseases, but little is known about autophagy in muscular dystrophies. We have previously found that muscular dystrophies linked to collagen VI deficiency show dysfunctional mitochondria and spontaneous apoptosis, leading to myofiber degeneration. Here we demonstrate that this persistence of abnormal organelles and apoptosis are caused by defective autophagy. Skeletal muscles of collagen VI-knockout (Col6a1(-/-)) mice had impaired autophagic flux, which matched the lower induction of beclin-1 and BCL-2/adenovirus E1B-interacting protein-3 (Bnip3) and the lack of autophagosomes after starvation. Forced activation of autophagy by genetic, dietary and pharmacological approaches restored myofiber survival and ameliorated the dystrophic phenotype of Col6a1(-/-) mice. Furthermore, muscle biopsies from subjects with Bethlem myopathy or Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy had reduced protein amounts of beclin-1 and Bnip3. These findings indicate that defective activation of the autophagic machinery is pathogenic in some congenital muscular dystrophies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Polymorphisms in human lactate transporter proteins (monocarboxylate transporters; MCTs), especially the MCT1 isoform, can affect lactate transport activity and cause signs of exercise-induced myopathy. Muscles express MCT1, MCT4 and CD147, an ancillary protein, indispensable for the activity of MCT1 and MCT4. We sequenced the coding sequence (cDNA) of horse MCT4 for the first time and examined polymorphisms in the cDNA of MCT1, MCT4 and CD147 of 16 healthy horses. To study whether signs of myopathy are linked to the polymorphisms, biopsy samples were taken from 26 horses with exercise-induced recurrent myopathy. Two polymorphisms that cause a change in amino acid sequence were found in MCT1 (Val(432)Ile and Lys(457)Gln) and one in CD147 (Met(125)Val). All polymorphisms in MCT4 were silent. Mutations in MCT1 or CD147 in equine muscle were not associated with myopathy. In the future, a functional study design is needed to evaluate the physiological role of the polymorphisms found.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Macroautophagy, a homeostatic process that shuttles cytoplasmic constituents into endosomal and lysosomal compartments, has recently been shown to deliver antigens for presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. Skeletal muscle fibers show a high level of constitutive macroautophagy and express MHC class II molecules upon immune activation. We found that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), a monokine overexpressed in inflammatory myopathies, led to a marked up-regulation of macroautophagy in skeletal myocytes. Furthermore, TNF-α augmented surface expression of MHC class II molecules in interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated myoblasts. The synergistic effect of TNF-α and IFN-γ on the induction of MHC class II surface expression was not reflected by higher intracellular human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR levels and was reversed by macroautophagy inhibition, suggesting that TNF-α facilitates antigen processing via macroautophagy for more efficient MHC class II loading. Muscle biopsies from patients with sporadic inclusion body myositis, a well defined myopathy with chronic inflammation, showed that over 20% of fibers that contained autophagosomes costained for MHC class II molecules and that more than 40% of double-positive muscle fibers had contact with CD4(+) and CD8(+) immune cells. These findings establish a mechanism through which TNF-α regulates both macroautophagy and MHC class II expression and suggest that macroautophagy-mediated antigen presentation contributes to the immunological environment of the inflamed human skeletal muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Pathogenic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations leading to mitochondrial dysfunction can cause cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Owing to a high mutation rate, mtDNA defects may occur at any nucleotide in its 16 569 bp sequence. Complete mtDNA sequencing may detect pathogenic mutations, which can be difficult to interpret because of normal ethnic/geographic-associated haplogroup variation. Our goal is to show how to identify candidate mtDNA mutations by sorting out polymorphisms using readily available online tools. The purpose of this approach is to help investigators in prioritizing mtDNA variants for functional analysis to establish pathogenicity. We analyzed complete mtDNA sequences from 29 Italian patients with mitochondrial cardiomyopathy or suspected disease. Using MITOMASTER and PhyloTree, we characterized 593 substitution variants by haplogroup and allele frequencies to identify all novel, non-haplogroup-associated variants. MITOMASTER permitted determination of each variant's location, amino acid change and evolutionary conservation. We found that 98% of variants were common or rare, haplogroup-associated variants, and thus unlikely to be primary cause in 80% of cases. Six variants were novel, non-haplogroup variants and thus possible contributors to disease etiology. Two with the greatest pathogenic potential were heteroplasmic, nonsynonymous variants: m.15132T>C in MT-CYB for a patient with hypertrophic dilated cardiomyopathy and m.6570G>T in MT-CO1 for a patient with myopathy. In summary, we have used our automated information system, MITOMASTER, to make a preliminary distinction between normal mtDNA variation and pathogenic mutations in patient samples; this fast and easy approach allowed us to select the variants for traditional analysis to establish pathogenicity.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the genes encoding the extracellular matrix protein collagen VI (ColVI) cause a spectrum of disorders with variable inheritance including Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, Bethlem myopathy, and intermediate phenotypes. We extensively characterized, at the clinical, cellular, and molecular levels, 49 patients with onset in the first 2 years of life to investigate genotype-phenotype correlations. METHODS: Patients were classified into 3 groups: early-severe (18%), moderate-progressive (53%), and mild (29%). ColVI secretion was analyzed in patient-derived skin fibroblasts. Chain-specific transcript levels were quantified by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and mutation identification was performed by sequencing of complementary DNA. RESULTS: ColVI secretion was altered in all fibroblast cultures studied. We identified 56 mutations, mostly novel and private. Dominant de novo mutations were detected in 61% of the cases. Importantly, mutations causing premature termination codons (PTCs) or in-frame insertions strikingly destabilized the corresponding transcripts. Homozygous PTC-causing mutations in the triple helix domains led to the most severe phenotypes (ambulation never achieved), whereas dominant de novo in-frame exon skipping and glycine missense mutations were identified in patients of the moderate-progressive group (loss of ambulation). INTERPRETATION: This work emphasizes that the diagnosis of early onset ColVI myopathies is arduous and time-consuming, and demonstrates that quantitative RT-PCR is a helpful tool for the identification of some mutation-bearing genes. Moreover, the clinical classification proposed allowed genotype-phenotype relationships to be explored, and may be useful in the design of future clinical trials.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe progressive myopathy caused by mutations in the DMD gene leading to a deficiency of the dystrophin protein. Due to ongoing muscle necrosis in respiratory muscles late-stage DMD is associated with respiratory insufficiency and chronic hypoxia (CH). To understand the effects of CH on dystrophin-deficient muscle in vivo, we exposed the Drosophila model for DMD (dmDys) to CH during a 16-day ascent to the summit of Mount Denali/McKinley (6194 meters above sea level). Additionally, dmDys and wild type (WT) flies were also exposed to CH in laboratory simulations of high altitude hypoxia. Expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix GeneChips® and validated using qPCR. Hypoxic dmDys differentially expressed 1281 genes, whereas the hypoxic WT flies differentially expressed 56 genes. Interestingly, a number of genes (e.g. heat shock proteins) were discordantly regulated in response to CH between dmDys and WT. We tested the possibility that the disparate molecular responses of dystrophin-deficient tissues to CH could adversely affect muscle by performing functional assays in vivo. Normoxic and CH WT and dmDys flies were challenged with acute hypoxia and time-to-recover determined as well as subjected to climbing tests. Impaired performance was noted for CH-dmDys compared to normoxic dmDys or WT flies (rank order: Normoxic-WT ≈ CH-WT> Normoxic-dmDys> CH-dmDys). These data suggest that dystrophin-deficiency is associated with a disparate, pathological hypoxic stress response(s) and is more sensitive to hypoxia induced muscle dysfunction in vivo. We hypothesize that targeting/correcting the disparate molecular response(s) to hypoxia may offer a novel therapeutic strategy in DMD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dominant mutations in the valosin containing protein (VCP) gene cause inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). We have generated a knock-in mouse model with the common R155H mutation. Mice demonstrate progressive muscle weakness starting approximately at the age of 6 months. Histology of mutant muscle showed progressive vacuolization of myofibrils and centrally located nuclei, and immunostaining shows progressive cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 and ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies in quadriceps myofibrils and brain. Increased LC3-II staining of muscle sections representing increased number of autophagosomes suggested impaired autophagy. Increased apoptosis was demonstrated by elevated caspase-3 activity and increased TUNEL-positive nuclei. X-ray microtomography (uCT) images show radiolucency of distal femurs and proximal tibiae in knock-in mice and uCT morphometrics shows decreased trabecular pattern and increased cortical wall thickness. Bone histology and bone marrow derived macrophage cultures in these mice revealed increased osteoclastogenesis observed by TRAP staining suggestive of Paget bone disease. The VCP(R155H/+) knock-in mice replicate the muscle, bone and brain pathology of inclusion body myopathy, thus representing a useful model for preclinical studies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Congenital myopathy with fibre type disproportion (CFTD) has been associated with mutations in ACTA1, SEPN1, RYR1 and TPM3 genes. We report the clinico-pathological and electrophysiological features of 2 unrelated cases with heterozygous TPM3 mutation. Case 1 is a 19-year-old lady who presented with motor delay in infancy, respiratory failure in early teens requiring non-invasive ventilation despite being ambulant, ptosis, axial more than proximal weakness and scoliosis. Case 2 is a 7-year-old boy with hypotonia, feeding difficulties, motor delay and scoliosis, also requiring non-invasive ventilation while ambulant. Muscle biopsies in both cases showed fibre type disproportion. Muscle MRI (Case 1) showed mild uniformly increased interstitial tissue in and around the muscles. Sequencing of TPM3 in case 1 revealed a previously described heterozygous c.503G > A(pArg168His) missense variant in exon 5 and a novel heterozygous missense mutation c.521A > C(pGlu174Ala), also in exon 5, in case 2. A mild abnormality in the single fibre EMG was documented on electrophysiology in both cases. These cases highlight the neuromuscular transmission defect in CFTD secondary to TPM3 mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Deficiency of thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) is a frequent cause of isolated myopathy or encephalomyopathy in children with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion. To determine the bases of disease onset, organ specificity and severity of TK2 deficiency, we have carefully characterized Tk2 H126N knockin mice (Tk2-/-). Although normal until postnatal day 8, Tk2-/-mice rapidly develop fatal encephalomyopathy between postnatal days 10 and 13. We have observed that wild-type Tk2 activity is constant in the second week of life, while Tk1 activity decreases significantly between postnatal days 8 and 13. The down-regulation of Tk1 activity unmasks Tk2 deficiency in Tk2-/-mice and correlates with the onset of mtDNA depletion in the brain and the heart. Resistance to pathology in Tk2 mutant organs depends on compensatory mechanisms to the reduced mtDNA level. Our analyses at postnatal day 13 have revealed that Tk2-/-heart significantly increases mitochondrial transcript levels relative to the mtDNA content. This transcriptional compensation allows the heart to maintain normal levels of mtDNA-encoded proteins. The up-regulation in mitochondrial transcripts is not due to increased expression of the master mitochondrial biogenesis regulators peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha and nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2, or to enhanced expression of the mitochondrial transcription factors A, B1 or B2. Instead, Tk2-/-heart compensates for mtDNA depletion by down-regulating the expression of the mitochondrial transcriptional terminator transcription factor 3 (MTERF3). Understanding the molecular mechanisms that allow Tk2 mutant organs to be spared may help design therapies for Tk2 deficiency.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Selenoprotein N-related myopathy (SEPN1-RM) is an early-onset muscle disorder that can manifest clinically as congenital muscular dystrophy with spinal rigidity and can result in specific pathological entities such as multiminicore disease, desmin-related myopathy with Mallory body-like inclusions, and congenital fiber-type disproportion. Here we describe the clinical, histopathological, muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and genetic findings of three Italian SEPN1-RM families. Proband 1 is a 31-year-old female who was floppy at birth and developed axial and mild lower limb-girdle weakness. The second proband is a 13-year-old boy with RSMD1. Probands 3 and 4 were brothers showing clinical phenotype of congenital myopathy. Muscle MRI demonstrated selective involvement of sartorius, gluteal muscles and distal gastrocnemius and sparing of rectus femoris and gracilis. Muscle histopathology showed in proband 1 myopathic changes with mild connective tissue increase and some fibres lacking the Z-line, while probands 2 and 3 had multiminicores. SEPN1 gene analysis revealed five mutations, three of which are novel. Proband 1 was a compound heterozygote for a 92-bp (exon 1) and a 1-bp deletion (exon 9); proband 2 had a 99-bp deletion and a 10-bp duplication in exon 1, and proband 3 presented a novel homozygous mutation in intron 10 acceptor splice site.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotubular myopathy and centronuclear myopathies (CNM) are congenital myopathies characterized by generalized muscle weakness and mislocalization of muscle fiber nuclei. Genetically distinct forms exist, and mutations in BIN1 were recently identified in autosomal recessive cases (ARCNM). Amphiphysins have been implicated in membrane remodeling in brain and skeletal muscle. Our objective was to decipher the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying different forms of CNM, with a focus on ARCNM cases. In this study, we compare the histopathological features from patients with X-linked, autosomal recessive, and dominant forms, respectively, mutated in myotubularin (MTM1), amphiphysin 2 (BIN1), and dynamin 2 (DNM2). We further characterize the ultrastructural defects in ARCNM muscles. We demonstrate that the two BIN1 isoforms expressed in skeletal muscle possess the phosphoinositide-binding domain and are specifically targeted to the triads close to the DHPR-RYR1 complex. Cardiac isoforms do not contain this domain, suggesting that splicing of BIN1 regulates its specific function in skeletal muscle. Immunofluorescence analyses of muscles from patients with BIN1 mutations reveal aberrations of BIN1 localization and triad organization. These defects are also observed in X-linked and autosomal dominant forms of CNM and in Mtm1 knockout mice. In addition to previously reported implications of BIN1 in cancer as a tumor suppressor, these findings sustain an important role for BIN1 skeletal muscle isoforms in membrane remodeling and organization of the excitation-contraction machinery. We propose that aberrant BIN1 localization and defects in triad structure are part of a common pathogenetic mechanism shared between the three forms of centronuclear myopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the TMEM70 gene are responsible for a familial form of complex V deficiency presenting with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, lactic acidosis, cardiomyopathy and mitochondrial myopathy. Here we present a case of TMEM70 deficiency due to compound heterozygous mutations, who displayed abnormal mitochondria with whorled cristae in muscle. Immunogold electron microscopy and tomography shows for the first time that nucleoid clusters of mtDNA are disrupted in the abnormal mitochondria, with both nucleoids and mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes confined to the outer rings of the whorls. This could explain the differential effects on the expression and assembly of complex V in different tissues.</rdfs:comment>

We report the genetic and clinical characteristics of two unrelated L-CMD patients. Patient 1 harbored a novel, L35P mutation and patient 2 a previously reported R249W mutation. The striking phenotype associated with L-CMD is important to recognize, as molecular diagnostic testing can spare patients unnecessary procedures and prompt the physician to monitor for associated cardiac arrhythmias.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>RATIONALE: A homozygous disruption or genetic mutation of the bag3 gene, a member of the Bcl-2-associated athanogene (BAG) family proteins, causes cardiomyopathy and myofibrillar myopathy that is characterized by myofibril and Z-disc disruption. However, the detailed disease mechanism is not yet fully understood. OBJECTIVE: bag3(-/-) mice exhibit differences in the extent of muscle degeneration between muscle groups with muscles experiencing the most usage degenerating at an accelerated rate. Usage-dependent muscle degeneration suggests a role for BAG3 in supporting cytoskeletal connections between the Z-disc and myofibrils under mechanical stress. The mechanism by which myofibrillar structure is maintained under mechanical stress remains unclear. The purpose of the study is to clarify the detailed molecular mechanism of BAG3-mediated muscle maintenance under mechanical stress. METHODS AND RESULTS: To address the question of whether bag3 gene knockdown induces myofibrillar disorganization caused by mechanical stress, in vitro mechanical stretch experiments using rat neonatal cardiomyocytes and a short hairpin RNA-mediated gene knockdown system of the bag3 gene were performed. As expected, mechanical stretch rapidly disrupts myofibril structures in bag3 knockdown cardiomyocytes. BAG3 regulates the structural stability of F-actin through the actin capping protein, CapZβ1, by promoting association between Hsc70 and CapZβ1. BAG3 facilitates the distribution of CapZβ1 to the proper location, and dysfunction of BAG3 induces CapZ ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. Inhibition of CapZβ1 function by overexpressing CapZβ2 increased myofibril vulnerability and fragmentation under mechanical stress. On the other hand, overexpression of CapZβ1 inhibits myofibrillar disruption in bag3 knockdown cells under mechanical stress. As a result, heart muscle isolated from bag3(-/-) mice exhibited myofibrillar degeneration and lost contractile activity after caffeine contraction. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest novel roles for BAG3 and Hsc70 in stabilizing myofibril structure and inhibiting myofibrillar degeneration in response to mechanical stress. These proteins are possible targets for further research to identify therapies for myofibrillar myopathy or other degenerative diseases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Collagen VI is an extracellular matrix protein with critical roles in maintaining muscle and skin integrity and function. Skin abnormalities, including predisposition to keratosis pilaris and abnormal scarring, were described in Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) and Bethlem myopathy (BM) patients carrying mutations in COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 genes, whereas COL6A5, previously designated as COL29A1, was linked to atopic dermatitis. To gain insight into the function of the newly identified collagen VI α5 and α6 chains in human skin, we studied their expression and localization in normal subjects and in genetically characterized UCMD and BM patients. We found that localization of α5, and to a lesser extent α6, is restricted to the papillary dermis, where the protein mainly colocalizes with collagen fibrils. In addition, both chains were found around blood vessels. In UCMD patients with COL6A1 or COL6A2 mutations, immunolabeling for α5 and α6 was often altered, whereas in a UCMD and in a BM patient, each with a COL6A3 mutation, expression of α5 and α6 was apparently unaffected, suggesting that these chains may substitute for α3, forming α1α2α5 or α1α2α6 heterotrimers.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions usually have a mendelian inheritance secondary to mutation in nuclear genes. One of these is the Twinkle gene whose mutation is responsible for autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). The number of reported cases with mainly myopathic symptoms and possible nervous system involvement related to Twinkle gene mutation is limited. We present a new French family of whom two members displayed myopathy and neuropathy associated with PEO, and we perform a clinical review in light of other observations reported in the literature. METHODS: The proband, one son and the daughter have been investigated. Southern blot analysis and long-range PCR assay have been performed from muscle biopsy specimens. Coding exons and flanking intron regions of polymerase gamma (POLG) and DNA helicase (Twinkle) genes were sequenced. RESULTS: Multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions have been found and sequencing of the Twinkle gene showed the change p.R374Q. CONCLUSION: Two other families from the literature also had the R374Q mutation. Symptoms reported in association with this mutation were myopathy, peripheral neuropathy, dysarthria and/or dysphagia, respiratory insufficiency and parkinsonism. Respiratory insufficiency caused by chest wall weakness was reported in other families with different Twinkle gene mutations, and one might provide exercise intolerance, dysarthria and/or dysphagia as symptoms in favor of the diagnosis. Occurrence of impressive emaciation was a peculiarity in our family.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (AD-CNM) is due to mutations in the gene encoding dynamin 2 (DNM2) involved in endocytosis and intracellular membrane trafficking. To understand the pathomechanisms resulting from a DNM2 mutation, we generated a knock-in mouse model expressing the most frequent AD-CNM mutation (KI-Dnm2(R465W)). Heterozygous (HTZ) mice developed a myopathy showing a specific spatial and temporal muscle involvement. In the primarily and prominently affected tibialis anterior muscle, impairment of the contractile properties was evidenced at weaning and was progressively associated with atrophy and histopathological abnormalities mainly affecting mitochondria and reticular network. Expression of genes involved in ubiquitin-proteosome and autophagy pathways was up-regulated during DNM2-induced atrophy. In isolated muscle fibers from wild-type and HTZ mice, Dnm2 localized in regions of intense membrane trafficking (I-band and perinuclear region), emphasizing the pathophysiological hypothesis in which DNM2-dependent trafficking would be altered. In addition, HTZ fibers showed an increased calcium concentration as well as an intracellular Dnm2 and dysferlin accumulation. A similar dysferlin retention, never reported so far in congenital myopathies, was also demonstrated in biopsies from DNM2-CNM patients and can be considered as a new marker to orientate direct genetic testing. Homozygous (HMZ) mice died during the first hours of life. Impairment of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, demonstrated in HMZ embryonic fibroblasts, could be the cause of lethality. Overall, this first mouse model of DNM2-related myopathy shows the crucial role of DNM2 in muscle homeostasis and will be a precious tool to study DNM2 functions in muscle, pathomechanisms of DNM2-CNM and developing therapeutic strategies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>This paper reports the clinical and metabolic findings in two sibling sisters born with fetal hydrops and eventually found to have deficient S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AHCY) activity due to compound heterozygosity for two novel mutations, c.145C>T; p.Arg49Cys and c.257A>G; p.Asp86Gly. Clinically, the major abnormalities in addition to fetal hydrops (very likely due to impaired synthetic liver function) were severe hypotonia/myopathy, feeding problems, and respiratory failure. Metabolic abnormalities included elevated plasma S-adenosylhomocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine, and methionine, with hypoalbuminemia, coagulopathies, and serum transaminase elevation. The older sister died at age 25 days, but the definitive diagnosis was made only retrospectively. The underlying genetic abnormality was diagnosed in the second sister, but treatment by means of dietary methionine restriction and supplementation with phosphatidylcholine and creatine did not prevent her death at age 122 days. These cases extend the experience with AHCY deficiency in humans, based until now on only the four patients previously identified, and suggest that the deficiency in question may be a cause of fetal hydrops and developmental abnormalities of the brain.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Centronuclear myopathy (CNM) is a rare congenital myopathy characterized by prominence of central nuclei on muscle biopsy. CNM has been associated with mutations in MTM1, DNM2, and BIN1 but many cases remain genetically unresolved. RYR1 encodes the principal sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel and has been implicated in various congenital myopathies. We investigated whether RYR1 mutations cause CNM. METHODS: We sequenced the entire RYR1 coding sequence in 24 patients with a diagnosis of CNM from South Africa (n = 14) and Europe (n = 10) and identified mutations in 17 patients. The most common genotypes featured compound heterozygosity for RYR1 missense mutations and mutations resulting in reduced protein expression, including intronic splice site and frameshift mutations. RESULTS: The high incidence in South African patients (n = 12/14) in conjunction with recurrent RYR1 mutations associated with common haplotypes suggested the presence of founder effects. In addition to central nuclei, prominent histopathological findings included (often multiple) internalized nuclei and type 1 fiber predominance and hypotrophy with relative type 2 hypertrophy. Although cores were not typically seen on oxidative stains, electron microscopy revealed subtle abnormalities in most cases. External ophthalmoplegia, proximal weakness, and bulbar involvement were prominent clinical findings. INTERPRETATION: Our findings expand the range of RYR1-related phenotypes and suggest RYR1 mutations as a common cause of congenital myopathies with central nuclei. Corresponding to recent observations in X-linked CNM, these findings indicate disturbed assembly and/or malfunction of the excitation-contraction machinery as a key mechanism in CNM and related myopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) is a complex disease of the upper respiratory airways. SAHS physiopathology is multifactorial in which airway compliance is a very important component. To evaluate the tissue changes in the palatopharyngeal muscle by morphometric, histochemical, immunohistochemical, and stereological quantification, with special attention to extracellular matrix associated with this muscle at the structural and ultrastructural levels. Thirty patients with SAHS were divided into groups of 10 according to disease severity: mild, moderate, and severe SAHS. In addition, the control group consisted of 10 patients. Fragments of palatopharyngeal muscle removed from patients with SAHS and tonsillectomies from patients in the control group were histopathologically submitted to light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Histopathological evaluations by light and transmission electron microscopes showed differences in analyzed groups, such as reduction of the muscle fiber diameter in patients with SAHS, taking disease severity into consideration. In contrast, stereological analysis showed a gradual increase of the collagen and elastic system fibers relative frequencies, proportionally to SAHS seriousness. MMP-2 and MMP-9 immunostaining also showed an increased reaction in the muscle fiber cytoplasm and endomisium during SAHS progression. The ultrastructural analysis showed that palatopharyngeal muscle fibers presented cytoplasmic residual corpuscles, a sign of early cell aging. In conclusion, the increase of tissue compliance in individuals with SAHS can be, in addition to other factors, consequence of diminished contractile activity of the muscle fibers, which exhibited clear signs of early senescence. Moreover, extracellular matrix components changes may contribute to muscle myopathy during SAHS progression.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations of the human valosin-containing protein gene cause autosomal-dominant inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia. We identified strumpellin as a novel valosin-containing protein binding partner. Strumpellin mutations have been shown to cause hereditary spastic paraplegia. We demonstrate that strumpellin is a ubiquitously expressed protein present in cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum cell fractions. Overexpression or ablation of wild-type strumpellin caused significantly reduced wound closure velocities in wound healing assays, whereas overexpression of the disease-causing strumpellin N471D mutant showed no functional effect. Strumpellin knockdown experiments in human neuroblastoma cells resulted in a dramatic reduction of axonal outgrowth. Knockdown studies in zebrafish revealed severe cardiac contractile dysfunction, tail curvature and impaired motility. The latter phenotype is due to a loss of central and peripheral motoneuron formation. These data imply a strumpellin loss-of-function pathogenesis in hereditary spastic paraplegia. In the human central nervous system strumpellin shows a presynaptic localization. We further identified strumpellin in pathological protein aggregates in inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia, various myofibrillar myopathies and in cortical neurons of a Huntington's disease mouse model. Beyond hereditary spastic paraplegia, our findings imply that mutant forms of strumpellin and valosin-containing protein may have a concerted pathogenic role in various protein aggregate diseases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart muscle disease, frequently accompanied by sudden cardiac death and terminal heart failure. Genotyping of ARVC patients might be used for palliative treatment of the affected family. We genotyped a cohort of 22 ARVC patients referred to molecular genetic screening in our heart center for mutations in the desmosomal candidate genes JUP, DSG2, DSC2, DSP and PKP2 known to be associated with ARVC. In 43% of the cohort, we found disease-associated sequence variants. In addition, we screened for desmin mutations and found a novel desmin-mutation p.N116S in a patient with ARVC and terminal heart failure, which is located in segment 1A of the desmin rod domain. The mutation leads to the aggresome formation in cardiac and skeletal muscle without signs of an overt clinical myopathy. Cardiac aggresomes appear to be prominent, especially in the right ventricle of the heart. Viscosimetry and atomic force microscopy of the desmin wild-type and N116S mutant isolated from recombinant Escherichia coli revealed severe impairment of the filament formation, which was supported by transfections in SW13 cells. Thus, the gene coding for desmin appears to be a novel ARVC gene, which should be included in molecular genetic screening of ARVC patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We have recently reported that a novel muscle-specific inositide phosphatase (MIP/MTMR14) plays a critical role in [Ca2+]i homeostasis through dephosphorylation of sn-1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl phosphatidylinositol (3,5) bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2). Loss of function mutations in MIP have been identified in human centronuclear myopathy. We developed a MIP knockout (MIPKO) animal model and found that MIPKO mice were more susceptible to exercise-induced muscle damage, a trademark of muscle functional changes in older subjects. We used wild-type (Wt) mice and MIPKO mice to elucidate the roles of MIP in muscle function during aging. We found MIP mRNA expression, MIP protein levels, and MIP phosphatase activity significantly decreased in old Wt mice. The mature MIPKO mice displayed phenotypes that closely resembled those seen in old Wt mice: i) decreased walking speed, ii) decreased treadmill activity, iii) decreased contractile force, and iv) decreased power generation, classical features of sarcopenia in rodents and humans. Defective Ca2+ homeostasis is also present in mature MIPKO and old Wt mice, suggesting a putative role of MIP in the decline of muscle function during aging. Our studies offer a new avenue for the investigation of MIP roles in skeletal muscle function and as a potential therapeutic target to treat aging sarcopenia.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To describe a wide range of clinical and pathologic myopathic profiles associated with the p.K1729del mutation in the MYH7 gene, known to cause Laing distal myopathy. METHODS: A study conducted in the Safor region (Spain), setting of a large cluster of patients. Clinical, neurophysiologic, muscle imaging, and muscle biopsy studies and MYH7 gene sequencing were investigated in 32 patients from 4 kindreds. Data from 36 deceased or nonexamined patients were collected from hospital records or relatives. RESULTS: Onset ranged from congenital to the 6th decade. All patients presented weakness of great toe/ankle dorsiflexors and many had associated neck flexor, finger extensor, and mild facial weakness. In most cases, involvement of proximal and axial muscles was observed either clinically or by muscle imaging, sometimes giving rise to scapuloperoneal and limb-girdle syndromes. Disabling myalgias, skeletal deformities, and dilated cardiomyopathy in one patient were associated features. Life expectancy was not reduced but the spectrum of disability ranged from asymptomatic to wheelchair confined. Electromyographic neurogenic features were frequently recorded. Muscle fiber type disproportion, core/minicore lesions, and mitochondrial abnormalities were the most relevant pathologic alterations. All patients carried the p.K1729del mutation in MYH7. CONCLUSIONS: The p.K1729del mutation in the MYH7 gene expresses notable clinical variability and electromyographic and pathologic features that can lead to the misdiagnosis of neurogenic atrophies, congenital myopathies, or mitochondrial myopathies. Mutations in genes encoding other sarcomeric and reticulo-sarcoplasmic proteins involved in calcium regulation share pathologic characteristics with our patients, suggesting a possible pathogenetic connection.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Collagen VI is an extracellular protein that most often contains the three genetically distinct polypeptide chains, α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI), although three recently identified chains, α4(VI), α5(VI), and α6(VI), may replace α3(VI) in some situations. Each chain has a triple helix flanked by N- and C-terminal globular domains that share homology with the von Willebrand factor type A (VWA) domains. During biosynthesis, the three chains come together to form triple helical monomers, which then assemble into dimers and tetramers. Tetramers are secreted from the cell and align end-to-end to form microfibrils. The precise molecular mechanisms responsible for assembly are unclear. Mutations in the three collagen VI genes can disrupt collagen VI biosynthesis and matrix organization and are the cause of the inherited disorders Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy. We have identified a Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy patient with compound heterozygous mutations in α2(VI). The first mutation causes skipping of exon 24, and the mRNA is degraded by nonsense-mediated decay. The second mutation is a two-amino acid deletion in the C1 VWA domain. Recombinant C1 domains containing the deletion are insoluble and retained intracellularly, indicating that the mutation has detrimental effects on domain folding and structure. Despite this, mutant α2(VI) chains retain the ability to associate into monomers, dimers, and tetramers. However, we show that secreted mutant tetramers containing structurally abnormal C1 VWA domains are unable to associate further into microfibrils, directly demonstrating the critical importance of a correctly folded α2(VI) C1 domain in microfibril formation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Desmin-related myopathy (DRM) is an autosomally inherited skeletal and cardiac myopathy, mainly caused by dominant mutations in the desmin gene (DES). We provide (i) a literature review on DRM, including clinical manifestations, inheritance, molecular genetics, myopathology and management and (ii) a meta-analysis of reported DES mutation carriers, focusing on their clinical characteristics and potential genotype-phenotype correlations. Meta-analysis: DES mutation carriers (n = 159) with 40 different mutations were included. Neurological signs were present in 74% and cardiological signs in 74% of carriers (both neurological and cardiological signs in 49%, isolated neurological signs in 22%, and isolated cardiological signs in 22%). More than 70% of carriers exhibited myopathy or muscular weakness, with normal creatine kinase levels present in one third of them. Up to 50% of carriers had cardiomyopathy and around 60% had cardiac conduction disease or arrhythmias, with atrioventricular block as an important hallmark. Symptoms generally started during the 30s; a quarter of carriers died at a mean age of 49 years. Sudden cardiac death occurred in two patients with a pacemaker, suggesting a ventricular tachyarrhythmia as cause of death. The majority of DES mutations were missense mutations, mostly located in the 2B domain. Mutations in the 2B domain were predominant in patients with an isolated neurological phenotype, whereas head and tail domain mutations were predominant in patients with an isolated cardiological phenotype.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Several studies documented the key role of oxidative stress and abnormal production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the pathophysiology of muscular dystrophies (MDs). The sources of ROS, however, are still controversial as well as their major molecular targets. This study investigated whether ROS produced in mitochondria by monoamine oxidase (MAO) contributes to MD pathogenesis. Pargyline, an MAO inhibitor, reduced ROS accumulation along with a beneficial effect on the dystrophic phenotype of Col6a1(-/-) mice, a model of Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital MD, and mdx mice, a model of Duchenne MD. Based on our previous observations on oxidative damage of myofibrillar proteins in heart failure, we hypothesized that MAO-dependent ROS might impair contractile function in dystrophic muscles. Indeed, oxidation of myofibrillar proteins, as probed by formation of disulphide cross-bridges in tropomyosin, was detected in both Col6a1(-/-) and mdx muscles. Notably, pargyline significantly reduced myofiber apoptosis and ameliorated muscle strength in Col6a1(-/-) mice. This study demonstrates a novel and determinant role of MAO in MDs, adding evidence of the pivotal role of mitochondria and suggesting a therapeutic potential for MAO inhibition.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The large GTPase dynamin has an important membrane scission function in receptor-mediated endocytosis and other cellular processes. Self-assembly on phosphoinositide-containing membranes stimulates dynamin GTPase activity, which is crucial for its function. Although the pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain is known to mediate phosphoinositide binding by dynamin, it remains unclear how this promotes activation. Here, we describe studies of dynamin PH domain mutations found in centronuclear myopathy (CNM) that increase dynamin's GTPase activity without altering phosphoinositide binding. CNM mutations in the PH domain C-terminal α-helix appear to cause conformational changes in dynamin that alter control of the GTP hydrolysis cycle. These mutations either 'sensitize' dynamin to lipid stimulation or elevate basal GTPase rates by promoting self-assembly and thus rendering dynamin no longer lipid responsive. We also describe a low-resolution structure of dimeric dynamin from small-angle X-ray scattering that reveals conformational changes induced by CNM mutations, and defines requirements for domain rearrangement upon dynamin self-assembly at membrane surfaces. Our data suggest that changes in the PH domain may couple lipid binding to dynamin GTPase activation at sites of vesicle invagination.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>AIMS: Desminopathy is a hereditary cardiac and skeletal myopathy caused by mutations in the desmin gene. This study summarizes the clinical, myopathological and genetic features of a series of Chinese patients with desminopathy. METHODS: Thirty-nine cases from five families with autosomal dominant inheritance and two sporadic cases were investigated. The majority of patients presented with mild myopathy and prominent cardiomyopathy. Fifteen of 16 deceased cases died of cardiac causes. Of the 25 patients alive, 24 patients developed cardiac abnormalities with disease progression. Muscle specimens from nine patients were investigated in various morphological examinations. Gene sequencing and cell transfections were performed to determine whether the mutant desmin formed intermediate filaments. RESULTS: Muscle biopsies revealed 5 cases with dystrophy-like patterns and amorphous material deposits; four other cases showed myopathy-like patterns with cytoplasmic bodies or nemaline bodies. Desmin and multiple proteins aggregated in the affected fibres. Six novel mutations and one previously reported mutation in the desmin gene were identified in the patients. All the mutant desmin genes except E457V produced multiple desmin-positive clumps or abnormal solid large aggregates in transfected cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study enlarges the spectrum of desmin mutations and geographic distribution of desminopathy. Although many novel mutations were identified in Chinese patients, the main clinical and myopathological findings were similar to those in Caucasian patients. Cardiac conduction abnormalities were prominent and usually appeared later than skeletal myopathy. The myopathology exhibited some heterogeneity among our patients, but the pathological changes were not indicative of the mutation location in the desmin gene.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We have been following clinically and with muscle MRI for the past 3-decades a Finnish family with two patients with distal muscular dystrophy. Previously we demonstrated the cellular defect in these patients to be defective membrane repair and more recently have identified the causative gene to be anoctamin 5 (ANO5). The disorder seen in these patients is characterized by onset in the third decade. First symptoms were burning sensation on the calves and later on calf tightness during running. Muscle weakness and wasting were asymmetric and early involving the calf muscles, later spread to the thigh muscles. Biceps brachi was later manifestation. Clinical course was slow. CK levels were high. Muscle biopsy showed dystrophic pattern and multifocal disruption of the sarcolemmal membrane but no subsarcolemmal vesicle accumulation nor active inflammation. We conclude that the disease seen in our cases is a new separate clinical, genetic and histopathologic entity to include within the classification of autosomal recessive distal muscular dystrophies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by near total absence of body fat since birth with predisposition to insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and hepatic steatosis. Three CGL loci, AGPAT2, BSCL2, and CAV1, have been identified previously. Recently, mutations in polymerase I and transcript release factor (PTRF) were reported in five Japanese patients presenting with myopathy and CGL (CGL4). We report novel PTRF mutations and detailed phenotypes of two male and three female patients with CGL4 belonging to two pedigrees of Mexican origin (CGL7100 and CGL178) and one pedigree of Turkish origin (CGL180). All patients had near total loss of body fat and congenital myopathy manifesting as weakness, percussion-induced muscle mounding, and high serum creatine kinase levels. Four of them had hypertriglyceridemia. Three of them had atlantoaxial instability. Two patients belonging to CGL178 pedigree required surgery for pyloric stenosis in the first month of life. None of them had prolonged QT interval on electrocardiography but both siblings belonging to CGL7100 had exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias. Three of them had mild acanthosis nigricans but had normal glucose tolerance. Two of them had hepatic steatosis. All patients had novel null mutations in PTRF gene. In conclusion, mutations in PTRF result in a novel phenotype that includes generalized lipodystrophy with mild metabolic derangements, myopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, atlantoaxial instability, and pyloric stenosis. It is unclear how mutations in PTRF, which plays an essential role in formation of caveolae, affect a wide variety of tissues resulting in a variable phenotype.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>PURPOSE: Mutations in ANT, a mitochondrial ATP transporter, are typically associated with myopathy. Because of the high metabolic demands of the retina, the authors examined whether elimination of the Ant1 isoform in a transgenic mouse affects retinal function or morphology. METHODS: RT-PCR was used to confirm Ant1 expression in retinas of wild-type (WT) or Ant1(-/-) mice. Full-field ERGs were used to test retinal function under dark- and light-adapted conditions and the recovery of the photoresponse to a bright flash. Using histologic methods, the authors assessed the retinal location of ANT and ANT1-β-gal reporter protein, mitochondrial activity with cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) staining, retinal layer thickness, and bipolar cell types using Chx10 and recoverin. RESULTS: Ant1(-/-) mice had supernormal ERG b-waves under both dark- and light-adapted conditions. X-Gal staining was detected in a subset of cells within the inner retina. The following characteristics were normal in Ant1(-/-) mice compared with age-matched WT mice: recovery of the photoresponse, COX and SDH activity, retinal morphology, and bipolar cell morphology. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of ANT1 in a subset of inner retinal cells accompanied by supernormal ERG responses suggests that ANT1 may be localized to hyperpolarizing bipolar cells. However, the immunohistochemical techniques used here did not show any differences in bipolar cells. Moderate functional changes coupled with a lack of detectable morphologic changes suggest that ANT1 is not essential for ATP transport in the retina.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) deficiency is among the most common causes of inherited metabolic disease, but its physiological consequences are poorly characterized. We studied the skeletal muscle gene expression profiles of mice with late-onset mitochondrial myopathy. These animals express a dominant patient mutation in the mitochondrial replicative helicase Twinkle, leading to accumulation of multiple mtDNA deletions and progressive subtle RC deficiency in the skeletal muscle. The global gene expression pattern of the mouse skeletal muscle showed induction of pathways involved in amino acid starvation response and activation of Akt signaling. Furthermore, the muscle showed induction of a fasting-related hormone, fibroblast growth factor 21 (Fgf21). This secreted regulator of lipid metabolism was also elevated in the mouse serum, and the animals showed widespread changes in their lipid metabolism: small adipocyte size, low fat content in the liver and resistance to high-fat diet. We propose that RC deficiency induces a mitochondrial stress response, with local and global changes mimicking starvation, in a normal nutritional state. These results may have important implications for understanding the metabolic consequences of mitochondrial myopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical and myopathological characteristics and desmin mutations in patients with desminopathy associated cardiomyopathy from 5 Chinese families. METHODS: Thirty-six individuals (18 male, 18 female) were from 4 autosomal dominant inherited families and 1 sporadic case. Nineteen patients manifested myopathy followed by cardiomyopathy; 13 patients presented with isolated cardiomyopathy; 1 patient had isolated myopathy; 3 patients died of cardiac diseases without detailed clinical information. Out of the 23 patients underwent electrocardiogram examinations, 20 patients showed kinds of abnormalities in cardiac conduction block. Echocardiogram revealed dilated cardiomyopathy in one case, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in one case, and restrictive cardiomyopathy in two cases. Muscle specimens from 7 different patients were performed for histological, immunohistochemistry and ultrastructural examinations. All exons of the desmin gene were screened in 21 patients, 17 asymptomatic family individuals and 50 Chinese controls. RESULTS: Muscle biopsies revealed multiple proteins aggregated in muscle fibers, also supported by immunostaining and electroscopic examinations. Five novel heterogeneous mutations were identified in 4 families and one sporadic case. CONCLUSIONS: Novel mutations of desmin gene were linked with cardiomyopathy in patients from 5 Chinese families with desminopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Familial ALS patients with TDP-43 gene mutations and sporadic ALS patients share common TDP-43 neuronal pathology. To delineate mechanisms underlying TDP-43 proteinopathies, transgenic mice expressing A315T, M337V or wild type human TDP-43 were generated. Multiple TDP-43 founders developed a severe early motor phenotype that correlated with TDP-43 levels in spinal cord. Three A315T TDP-43 lines developed later onset paralysis with cytoplasmic ubiquitin inclusions, gliosis and TDP-43 redistribution and fragmentation. The WT TDP-43 mouse line with highest spinal cord expression levels remains asymptomatic, although these mice show spinal cord pathology. One WT TDP-43 line with high skeletal muscle levels of TDP-43 developed a severe progressive myopathy. Over-expression of TDP-43 in vivo is sufficient to produce progressive motor phenotypes by a toxic gain of function paradigm. Transgenic mouse lines expressing untagged mutant and wild type TDP-43 under the same promoter represent a powerful new model system for studying TDP-43 proteinopathies in vivo.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: The administration of rituximab (RTX) in vivo results in B-cell depletion, but evidence for multiple mechanisms of action have been reported. Surprisingly, B cell depletion produced a response in patients with polymyositis, which is characterized as a T cell-mediated autoimmune disorder with biopsy findings similar to Miyoshi myopathy (MM). Indeed, in dysferlinopathies, there is evidence of immune system involvement including the presence of muscle inflammation and a down regulation of the complement inhibitory factor, CD55. METHODS: Two patients were treated with four weekly infusions of RTX 375 mg/m2. To measure the improvement in muscle strength after treatment, the isometric hand grip maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) was measured by load cell four times during treatment, and again after one year. In order to assess the reproducibility of our grip assessment, we determined the hand MVC analysis in 16 healthy subjects. Moreover, we measured the number of B cells present in patients by flow cytometric analysis during the course of treatment. RESULTS: The analysis of B cell number during the course of treatment showed that CD20- and CD19-positive cells were depleted to 0-0.01%. The decrease in B cells was followed by an improvement in the mobility of the pelvic and shoulder girdles as shown by the MRC%. The MVC values of both patients began at values lower than normal whereas during treatment patients had improved percentage of muscle strength. The strength peak in both patients coincided with the minimum B cell values. There were no severe adverse events associated with an infusion of RTX. CONCLUSION: We consider the increase in muscle strength observed in both treated patients to be a consequence of their treatment with RTX. To our knowledge, these are the first cases of increased muscle strength in patients with MM. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that B cell depletion with RTX may be useful in the treatment of patients affected by MM, suggesting a possible role for B cells in the pathophysiology of this muscle disorder.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mdx mice develop an inflammatory myopathy characterized at different ages by myonecrosis with scattered inflammatory infiltrates followed by muscular regeneration and later persistent fibrosis. This work aimed to verify the putative anti-inflammatory role of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in the mdx muscular lesion. Mitigation of myonecrosis and decreased TNFα production were accompanied by increased numbers of F4/80 macrophages expressing nAChRα7. In vivo treatment with nicotine attenuated muscular inflammation characterized by reduced metalloprotease MMP-9 activity, TNFα and NFkB content and increased muscular regeneration. Our data indicate that nAChR activation influences local inflammatory responses in the muscular lesion of mdx mice.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>DOK7 mutations cause a congenital myasthenic syndrome (OMIM 254300) characterized by a "limb-girdle" phenotype. We identified 7 French-Canadian patients with a previously undiagnosed proximal myopathy. A genome wide scan was performed. Homozygosity mapping identified a locus on chromosome 4p16.2 containing DOK7. Sequencing of DOK7 revealed homozygous 1124_1127dupTGCC mutations in all individuals. SNP genotyping of 42kb surrounding DOK7 in our cohort and in 9 patients of various European origins demonstrated a shared haplotype suggesting a common ancestral European mutation. In our cohort, fatigability was not prominent; rather patients reported prolonged periods of increased weakness. Abnormalities on repetitive nerve stimulation and single fiber EMG were not invariably present. There was considerable intra-familial phenotypic variability, and we report an asymptomatic individual. DOK7 mutations should be considered in patients with early-onset myopathy, even in the absence of symptoms suggesting a possible myasthenia.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myofibrillar myopathies are a heterogeneous group of neuromuscular disorders characterized by disintegration of myofibrils. The inheritance pattern is commonly autosomal dominant, but there has been a striking absence of secondary cases noted in a BAG3-associated subtype. We studied three families with BAG3 p.Pro209Leu mutation showing a severe phenotype of myofibrillar myopathy and axonal neuropathy with giant axons. In one family, transmission to a pair of siblings has occurred from their asymptomatic father who showed somatic mosaicism. In two other families, neither of the parents was affected or showed detectable level of somatic mosaicism. These observations suggest that the BAG3 variant of myofibrillar myopathy may result from a spontaneous mutation at an early point of embryonic development and that transmission from a mosaic parent may occur more than once. The study underlines the importance of parental evaluation as it may have implications for genetic counseling.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Valosin-containing protein (VCP) has been shown to colocalize with abnormal protein aggregates, such as nuclear inclusions of Huntington disease and Machado-Joseph disease, Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease. Several mis-sense mutations in the human VCP gene have been identified in patients suffering inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). Recently, we have shown that VCP possesses both aggregate-forming and aggregate-clearing activities. Here, we showed that in cells treated with proteasome inhibitors VCP first appeared as several small aggregates throughout the cells; and then, these small aggregates gathered together into a single big aggregate. Subcellular localization and ATPase activity of VCP clearly influenced the localization of the aggregates. Furthermore, all tested IBMPFD-causing mutant VCPs, possessed elevated ATPase activities and enhanced aggregate-forming activities in cultured cells. In Drosophila, these mutants and VCP(T761E), a super active VCP, did not appear to spontaneously induce eye degeneration, but worsened the phenotype when co-expressed with polyglutamines. Unexpectedly, these VCPs did not apparently change sizes and the amounts of polyglutamine aggregates in Drosophila eyes. Elevated ATPase activities, thus, may be a hidden primary defect causing IBMPFD pathological phenotypes, which would be revealed when abnormal proteins are accumulated, as typically observed in aging.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders are a heterogeneous group of disorders in which the underlying genetic defect is often unknown. We have identified a pathogenic mutation (c.156C>G [p.F52L]) in YARS2, located at chromosome 12p11.21, by using genome-wide SNP-based homozygosity analysis of a family with affected members displaying myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA). We subsequently identified the same mutation in another unrelated MLASA patient. The YARS2 gene product, mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (YARS2), was present at lower levels in skeletal muscle whereas fibroblasts were relatively normal. Complex I, III, and IV were dysfunctional as indicated by enzyme analysis, immunoblotting, and immunohistochemistry. A mitochondrial protein-synthesis assay showed reduced levels of respiratory chain subunits in myotubes generated from patient cell lines. A tRNA aminoacylation assay revealed that mutant YARS2 was still active; however, enzyme kinetics were abnormal compared to the wild-type protein. We propose that the reduced aminoacylation activity of mutant YARS2 enzyme leads to decreased mitochondrial protein synthesis, resulting in mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction. MLASA has previously been associated with PUS1 mutations; hence, the YARS2 mutation reported here is an alternative cause of MLASA.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The sulfhydryl oxidase augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) binds FAD in a helix-rich domain that presents a CxxC disulfide proximal to the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin. Head-to-tail interchain disulfide bonds link subunits within the homodimer of both the short, cytokine-like, form of ALR (sfALR), and a longer form (lfALR) which resides in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS). lfALR has an 80-residue N-terminal extension with an additional CxxC motif required for the reoxidation of reduced Mia40 during oxidative protein folding within the IMS. Recently, Di Fonzo et al. [Di Fonzo, A., Ronchi, D., Lodi, T., Fassone, E., Tigano, M., Lamperti, C., Corti, S., Bordoni, A., Fortunato, F., Nizzardo, M., Napoli, L., Donadoni, C., Salani, S., Saladino, F., Moggio, M., Bresolin, N., Ferrero, I., and Comi, G. P. (2009) Am. J. Hum. Genet. 84, 594-604] described an R194H mutation of human ALR that led to cataract, progressive muscle hypotonia, and hearing loss in three children. The current work presents a structural and enzymological characterization of the human R194H mutant in lf- and sfALR. A crystal structure of human sfALR was determined by molecular replacement using the rat sfALR structure. R194 is located at the subunit interface of sfALR, close to the intersubunit disulfide bridges. The R194 guanidino moiety participates in three H-bonds: two main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms (from R194 itself and from C95 of the intersubunit disulfide of the other protomer) and with the 2'-OH of the FAD ribose. The R194H mutation has minimal effect on the enzyme activity using model and physiological substrates of short and long ALR forms. However, the mutation adversely affects the stability of both ALR forms: e.g., by decreasing the melting temperature by about 10 degrees C, by increasing the rate of dissociation of FAD from the holoenzyme by about 45-fold, and by strongly enhancing the susceptibility of sfALR to partial proteolysis and to reduction of its intersubunit disulfide bridges by glutathione. Finally, a comparison of the TROSY-HSQC 2D NMR spectra of wild-type sfALR and its R194H mutant reveals a significant increase in conformational flexibility in the mutant protein. In sum, these in vitro data document the major impact of the seemingly conservative R194H mutation on the stability of dimeric ALR and complement the in vivo observations of Di Fonzo et al.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Systemic primary carnitine deficiency (CDSP) is caused by recessive mutations in the SLC22A5 (OCTN2) gene encoding the plasmalemmal carnitine transporter and characterized by hypoketotic hypoglycemia, and skeletal and cardiac myopathy. The entire coding regions of the OCTN2 gene were sequenced in 143 unrelated subjects suspected of having CDSP. In 70 unrelated infants evaluated because of abnormal newborn screening (NBS) results, 48 were found to have at least 1 mutation/unclassified missense variant. Twenty-eight of 33 mothers whose infants had abnormal NBS results were found to carry at least 1 mutation/unclassified missense variant, including 11 asymptomatic mothers who had 2 mutations. Therefore, sequencing of the OCTN2 gene is recommended for infants with abnormal NBS results and for their mothers. Conversely, 52 unrelated subjects were tested due to clinical indications other than abnormal NBS and only 14 of them were found to have at least one mutation/unclassified variant. Custom designed oligonucleotide array CGH analysis revealed a heterozygous approximately 1.6 Mb deletion encompassing the entire OCTN2 gene in one subject who was apparently homozygous for the c.680G>A (p.R227H) mutation. Thus, copy number abnormalities at the OCTN2 locus should be considered if by sequencing, an apparently homozygous mutation or only one mutant allele is identified.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: The most frequent phenotypes of dysferlin myopathy are limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy (MM). Our objective was to find clinical or MRI markers to differentiate phenotypes of dysferlin myopathy regardless of initial symptoms. METHODS: This retrospective study included 29 patients with confirmed mutations in the DYSF gene (14 MM, 12 LGMD2B, 1 asymptomatic hyperCKemia, and 2 symptomatic carriers). All underwent an annual clinical examination (Medical Research Council scale), functional status assessment, and creatine kinase, pulmonary, and cardiac testing. For research purposes, we performed lower limb MRI studies in all 29 patients to identify the pattern of muscle impairment and to quantify involvement. Statistical correlations between MRI findings and phenotype, disease duration, and functional status were determined. RESULTS: The mean clinical follow-up was 6.4 +/-5.7 years. No significant differences were found in the rate of progression, functional prognosis, or mutations between patients with MM and patients with LGMD2B. The MRI pattern of muscle involvement was the same for patients with MM and patients with LGMD2B. The adductor magnus and gastrocnemius medialis were the first to be impaired in both phenotypes. The progression of muscle involvement correlated with clinical status. CONCLUSIONS: Splitting dysferlin myopathy into separate phenotypes does not reveal significant differences in terms of rate of progression, prognosis, genotype, or MRI pattern. The finding that proximal and distal muscles are already impaired in the MRI at onset in both MM and LGMD2B favors grouping all phenotypes under the term dysferlin myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Reducing body myopathy (RBM) is a rare progressive disorder of muscle characterized by intracytoplasmic inclusions, which stain strongly with menadione-NBT (nitroblue tetrazolium). We recently identified the four and a half LIM domain gene FHL1 located on chromosome Xq26 as the causative gene for RBM. So far eight familial cases and 21 sporadic patients with RBM have been reported in the literature. METHODS: We ascertained a total of 8 members of a German family initially reported by Goebel et al. as a mixed myopathy with rigid spine myopathy and reducing as well as cytoplasmic bodies. Clinical findings in the original and additional family members have been reviewed. Mutation detection was performed by direct sequencing of FHL1 exons. RESULTS: We identified a novel mutation (p.C150R) in the second LIM domain of FHL1 in six family members (1 male, 5 females). The male index patient was the most affected member presenting with rigid spine, followed by rapidly progressive muscle weakness. He died from the consequences of respiratory insufficiency at the age of 29.5 years. His sister, mother, grandmother, aunt and female cousin all carried the mutation in the heterozygous state. The sister is clinically unaffected; their mother had myopathic changes in her muscle biopsy, while the grandmother showed first signs of weakness at 50 years of age. The 54-year-old aunt and her daughter are clinically asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: We report a novel LIM2 domain mutation in FHL1 in a previously reported family with RBM with cytoplasmic bodies and spinal rigidity. While the male index patient was significantly affected, female carriers show varying manifestations and may be asymptomatic, likely reflecting varying degrees of X-inactivation. RBM continues to be associated with mutations in the LIM2 domain of FHL1. We also confirm our earlier observation that mutations at the N-terminal end of the LIM2 domain seem to be milder compared to mutations seen at the C-terminal part of the domain which cause severe disease even in female carriers.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2J caused by mutations in C-terminal titin has so far been identified in Finnish patients only. This may in part be due to limited availability of diagnostic tests for titin defects. In this report, a French family with an autosomal-dominant late-onset distal myopathy of the tibial muscular dystrophy phenotype segregating in several members of the family was described. One deceased patient in the family proved to be homozygous for the C-terminal truncating titin mutation because of consanguinity. According to available medical records, the patient had a clearly more severe generalised muscle weakness and atrophy phenotype not recognised as a distal myopathy at the time. Autopsy findings in one of the original Finnish limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2J patients were reported and the early phenotype in a newly identified young patient with homozygous Finnish C-terminal titin mutation (FINmaj) was detailed.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Cysteine is considered a nonessential amino acid in mammals as it is synthesized from methionine via trans-sulfuration. However, premature infants or patients with hepatic failure may require dietary cysteine due to a lack of cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH), a key trans-sulfuration enzyme. Here, we generated CTH-deficient (Cth(-/-)) mice as an animal model of cystathioninemia/cystathioninuria. Cth(-/-) mice developed normally in general but displayed hypercystathioninemia/hyperhomocysteinemia though not hypermethioninemia. When fed a low cyst(e)ine diet, Cth(-/-) mice showed acute skeletal muscle atrophy (myopathy) accompanied by enhanced gene expression of asparagine synthetase and reduced contents of glutathione in livers and skeletal muscles, and intracellular accumulation of LC3 and p62 in skeletal myofibers; they finally died of severe paralysis of the extremities. Cth(-/-) hepatocytes required cystine in a culture medium and showed greater sensitivity to oxidative stress. Cth(-/-) mice exhibited systemic vulnerability to oxidative injury, which became more prominent when they were fed the low cyst(e)ine diet. These results reveal novel roles of trans-sulfuration previously unrecognized in mice lacking another trans-sulfuration enzyme cystathionine beta-synthase (Cbs(-/-)). Because Cbs(-/-) mice display hyperhomocysteinemia and hypermethioninemia, our results raise questions against the homocysteine-based etiology of CBS deficiency and the current newborn screening for homocysteinemia using Guthrie's method, which detects hypermethioninemia.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>RATIONALE: Physiological hypertrophy in the developing heart has been considered the product of an increase in volume of preexisting fetal cardiomyocytes in the absence of myocyte formation. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we tested whether the mouse heart at birth has a pool of cardiac stem cells (CSCs) that differentiate into myocytes contributing to the postnatal expansion of the parenchymal cell compartment. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have found that the newborn heart contains a population of c-kit-positive CSCs that are lineage negative, self-renewing, and multipotent. CSCs express the Notch1 receptor and show the nuclear localization of its active fragment, N1ICD. In 60% of cases, N1ICD was coupled with the presence of Nkx2.5, indicating that the commitment of CSCs to the myocyte lineage is regulated by Notch1. Importantly, overexpression of N1ICD in neonatal CSCs significantly expanded the proportion of transit-amplifying myocytes. To establish whether these in vitro findings had a functional counterpart in vivo, the Notch pathway was blocked in newborn mice by administration of a gamma-secretase inhibitor. This intervention resulted in the development of a dilated myopathy and high mortality rates. Ventricular decompensation was characterized by a 62% reduction in amplifying myocytes, which resulted in a 54% decrease in myocyte number. After cessation of Notch blockade and recovery of myocyte regeneration, cardiac anatomy and function were largely restored. CONCLUSIONS: Notch1 signaling is a critical determinant of CSC growth and differentiation; when this cascade of events is altered, cardiomyogenesis is impaired, physiological cardiac hypertrophy is prevented, and a life-threatening myopathy supervenes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations that result in the loss of the protein dysferlin result in defective muscle membrane repair and cause either a form of limb girdle muscular dystrophy (type 2B) or Miyoshi myopathy. Most patients are compound heterozygotes, often carrying one allele with a nonsense mutation. Using dysferlin-deficient mouse and human myocytes, we demonstrated that membrane blebbing in skeletal muscle myotubes in response to hypotonic shock requires dysferlin. Based on this, we developed an in vitro assay to assess rescue of dysferlin function in skeletal muscle myotubes. This blebbing assay may be useful for drug discovery/validation for dysferlin deficiency. With this assay, we demonstrate that the nonsense suppression drug, ataluren (PTC124), is able to induce read-through of the premature stop codon in a patient with a R1905X mutation in dysferlin and produce sufficient functional dysferlin (approximately 15% of normal levels) to rescue myotube membrane blebbing. Thus ataluren is a potential therapeutic for dysferlin-deficient patients harboring nonsense mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Distal myopathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by progressive weakness and muscular atrophy, beginning in distal limb muscles and affecting proximal limb muscles at a later stage. We studied a large German kindred with 10 affected members. Weakness and atrophy of the anterior tibial muscles started between the ages of 8 and 16 years, followed by atrophy of intrinsic hand muscles. Progression was slow, and patients retained the ability to walk until the seventh decade. Serum creatinine kinase levels were increased in the range of 150-1400 U/l. Muscle biopsies showed myopathic changes, whereas immunohistochemistry showed normal expression of marker proteins for muscular dystrophies. Patients had reduced sensation with stocking-glove distribution in the distal limbs in later life. Nerve conduction studies revealed no evidence of neuropathy. Genome-wide linkage analysis in this family revealed a new locus for distal myopathy at 9p21.2-p22.3 (multipoint logarithm of the odds ratio=4.21). By positional cloning we found a heterozygous mutation L95F in the Kelch-like homologue 9 gene, encoding a bric-a-brac Kelch protein. Molecular modelling indicated that the mutation may interfere with the interaction of the bric-a-brac domain with Cullin 3. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that the mutation reduces association with Cullin 3 in the Kelch-like homologue 9-Cullin 3-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which is involved in ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. We identified a unique form of early onset autosomal dominant distal myopathy which is associated with a Kelch-like homologue 9 mutation and interferes with normal skeletal muscle through a novel pathogenetic mechanism.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Here we introduce myopodin as a novel filamin C binding partner. Corroborative yeast two-hybrid and biochemical analyses indicate that the central part of myopodin that shows high homology to the closely related protein synaptopodin and that is common to all its currently known or predicted variants interacts with filamin C immunoglobulin-like domains 20-21. A detailed characterization of the previously described interaction between myopodin and alpha-actinin demonstrates for the first time that myopodin contains three independent alpha-actinin-binding sites. Newly developed myopodin-specific antibodies reveal expression at the earliest stages of in vitro differentiation of human skeletal muscle cells preceding the expression of sarcomeric alpha-actinin. Myopodin colocalizes with filamin and alpha-actinin during all stages of muscle development. By contrast, colocalization with its previously identified binding partner zyxin is restricted to early developmental stages. Genetic and cellular analyses of skeletal muscle provided direct evidence for an alternative transcriptional start site in exon three, corroborating the expression of a myopodin variant lacking the PDZ domain encoded by exons 1 and 2 in skeletal muscle. We conclude that myopodin is a multiadapter protein of the sarcomeric Z-disc that links nascent myofibrils to the sarcolemma via zyxin, and might play a role in early assembly and stabilization of the Z-disc. Mutations in FLNC, ACTN2 and several other genes encoding Z-disc-related proteins cause myopathy and cardiomyopathy. Its localization and its association with the myopathy-associated proteins filamin C and alpha-actinin make myopodin an interesting candidate for a muscle disease gene.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mitochondrial genomes with deleterious mutations can replicate in cells along with wild-type genomes in a state of heteroplasmy, and are a cause of severe inherited syndromes, such as mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke (MELAS), neuropathy, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa-maternally inherited Leigh syndrome (NARP-MILS), and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). The cytosolic E3 ligase, Parkin, commonly mutated in recessive familial parkinsonism, translocates to depolarized mitochondria and induces their autophagic elimination, suggesting that Parkin may signal the selective removal of defective mitochondria within the cell. We report that long-term overexpression of Parkin can eliminate mitochondria with deleterious COXI mutations in heteroplasmic cybrid cells, thereby enriching cells for wild-type mtDNA and restoring cytochrome c oxidase activity. After relieving cybrid cells of Parkin overexpression, a more favorable wild-type to mutant mitochondrial genome ratio is stably maintained. These data support the model that Parkin functions in a mitochondrial quality control pathway. Additionally, they suggest that transiently increasing levels of Parkin expression might ameliorate certain mitochondrial diseases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mouse lines with dysferlin deficiency are accepted animal models for limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B and Miyoshi myopathy, yet slow progression of pathology prevents rapid screening of potential therapies for this disease. Our goal was to define a functional signature for skeletal muscles that lack dysferlin. Force generation and susceptibility to eccentric contractile injury measurements were performed in isolated limb muscles and the diaphragm from 10- and 36-week-old A/J and age-matched control mice. Limb muscles had normal specific force at both 10 and 36 weeks, whereas the diaphragm had significant deficits in both specific force and susceptibility to eccentric contractile injury. Membrane ruptures in the diaphragm during eccentric contractions occurred predominantly in myosin heavy chain 2A-expressing fibers. Dysferlin content did not vary significantly between wildtype muscles, suggesting that there was no correlation between disease severity and normal endogenous levels of the protein. These studies show that, unlike limb muscles, the diaphragm from the A/J mouse displays early deficits in function that may lower the age needed for evaluating potential therapies for dysferlinopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The allelic muscle disorders known as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B), Miyoshi myopathy and distal anterior compartment myopathy result from defects in dysferlin-a sarcolemma-associated protein involved in membrane repair. Mutation screening in the dysferlin gene (DYSF) enabled the identification of seven Portuguese patients presenting the variant c.5492G>A, which was observed to promote skipping of exon 49 (p.Gly1802ValfsX17). Several residually expressed products of alternative splicing also involving exons 50 and 51 were detected in the leukocytes and muscle of both patients and normal controls. Quantitative transcript analysis confirmed these results and revealed that Delta49/Delta50 transcripts were predominant in blood. Although the patients were apparently unrelated, the c.5492G>A mutation was found in linkage disequilibrium with a particularly rare haplotype in the population, corroborating the hypothesis of a common origin. Despite the presence of the same mutation on the same haplotype background, onset of the disease was heterogeneous, with either proximal or distal muscle involvement.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is a dominantly inherited degenerative disorder caused by mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP7) gene. VCP (p97 in mouse, TER94 in Drosophila melanogaster, and CDC48 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is a highly conserved AAA(+) (ATPases associated with multiple cellular activities) ATPase that regulates a wide array of cellular processes. The mechanism of IBMPFD pathogenesis is unknown. To elucidate the pathogenic mechanism, we developed and characterized a Drosophila model of IBMPFD (mutant-VCP-related degeneration). Based on genetic screening of this model, we identified three RNA-binding proteins that dominantly suppressed degeneration; one of these was TBPH, the Drosophila homolog of TAR (trans-activating response region) DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Here we demonstrate that VCP and TDP-43 interact genetically and that disease-causing mutations in VCP lead to redistribution of TDP-43 to the cytoplasm in vitro and in vivo, replicating the major pathology observed in IBMPFD and other TDP-43 proteinopathies. We also demonstrate that TDP-43 redistribution from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is sufficient to induce cytotoxicity. Furthermore, we determined that a pathogenic mutation in TDP-43 promotes redistribution to the cytoplasm and enhances the genetic interaction with VCP. Together, our results show that degeneration associated with VCP mutations is mediated in part by toxic gain of function of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm. We suggest that these findings are likely relevant to the pathogenic mechanism of a broad array of TDP-43 proteinopathies, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in p97, a major cytosolic AAA (ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities) chaperone, cause inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). IBMPFD mutants have single amino-acid substitutions at the interface between the N-terminal domain (N-domain) and the adjacent AAA domain (D1), resulting in a reduced affinity for ADP. The structures of p97 N-D1 fragments bearing IBMPFD mutations adopt an atypical N-domain conformation in the presence of Mg(2+).ATPgammaS, which is reversible by ADP, showing for the first time the nucleotide-dependent conformational change of the N-domain. The transition from the ADP-to the ATPgammaS-bound state is accompanied by a loop-to-helix conversion in the N-D1 linker and by an apparent re-ordering in the N-terminal region of p97. X-ray scattering experiments suggest that wild-type p97 subunits undergo a similar nucleotide-dependent N-domain conformational change. We propose that IBMPFD mutations alter the timing of the transition between nucleotide states by destabilizing the ADP-bound form and consequently interfere with the interactions between the N-domains and their substrates.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Mutations in the Twinkle (PEO1) gene are a recognized cause of autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO), resulting in the accumulation of multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions and cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-deficient fibers in skeletal muscle secondary to a disorder of mtDNA maintenance. Patients typically present with isolated extraocular muscle involvement, with little apparent evidence of the clinical heterogeneity documented in other mtDNA maintenance disorders, in particular POLG-related disease. METHODS: We reviewed the clinical, histochemical, and molecular genetics analysis of 33 unreported patients from 26 families together with all previous cases described in the literature to define the clinical phenotype associated with PEO1 mutations. RESULTS: Ptosis and ophthalmoparesis were almost universal clinical features among this cohort, with 52% (17/33) reporting fatigue and 33% (11/33) having mild proximal myopathy. Features consistent with CNS involvement were rarely described; however, in 24% (8/33) of the patients, cardiac abnormalities were reported. Mitochondrial histochemical changes observed in muscle showed remarkable variability, as did the secondary mtDNA deletions, which in some patients were only detected by PCR-based assays and not Southern blotting. Moreover, we report 7 novel PEO1 variants. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a shared clinical phenotype with variable mild multiorgan involvement, and that the contribution of PEO1 mutations as a cause of adPEO may well be underestimated. Direct sequencing of the PEO1 gene should be considered in adPEO patients prior to muscle biopsy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Caveolin-3 is an important scaffold protein of cholesterol-rich caveolae. Mutations of caveolin-3 cause hereditary myopathies that comprise remarkably different pathologies. Growth factor signaling plays an important role in muscle physiology; it is influenced by caveolins and cholesterol-rich rafts and might thus be affected by caveolin-3 dysfunction. Prompted by the observation of a marked chronic peripheral neuropathy in a patient suffering from rippling muscle disease due to the R26Q caveolin-3 mutation and because TrkA is expressed by neuronal cells and skeletal muscle fibers, we performed a detailed comparative study on the effect of pathogenic caveolin-3 mutants on the signaling and trafficking of the TrkA nerve growth factor receptor and, for comparison, of the epidermal growth factor receptor. We found that the R26Q mutant slightly and the P28L strongly reduced nerve growth factor signaling in TrkA-transfected cells. Surface biotinylation experiments revealed that the R26Q caveolin-3 mutation markedly reduced the internalization of TrkA, whereas the P28L did not. Moreover, P28L expression led to increased, whereas R26Q expression decreased, epidermal growth factor signaling. Taken together, we found differential effects of the R26Q and P28L caveolin-3 mutants on growth factor signaling. Our findings are of clinical interest because they might help explain the remarkable differences in the degree of muscle lesions caused by caveolin-3 mutations and also the co-occurrence of peripheral neuropathy in the R26Q caveolinopathy case presented.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Muscle inflammation can be a prominent feature in several muscular dystrophies. In dysferlin myopathy, it is mainly composed of macrophages. To understand the origin of inflammation in dysferlin-deficient muscle, we analyzed soluble factors involved in monocyte chemotaxis released by myoblasts and myotubes from control and dysferlinopathy patients using a transwell system. Dysferlin-deficient myotubes released more soluble factors involved in monocyte chemotaxis compared with controls (p &lt; 0.001). Messenger RNA microarray analysis showed a 3.2-fold increase of thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) expression in dysferlin-deficient myotubes. Retrotranscriptasepolymerase chain reaction analysis, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry confirmed these results. Dysferlin mRNA knockdown with short-interfering RNA in normal myogenic cells resulted in TSP-1 mRNA upregulation and increased chemotaxis. Furthermore, monocyte chemotaxis was decreased when TSP-1 was blocked by specific antibodies. In muscle biopsies from dysferlinopathy patients, TSP-1 expression was increased in muscle fibers but not in biopsies of patientswith other myopathies with inflammation; TSP-1 was seen in some macrophages in all samples analyzed. Taken together, the data demonstrate that dysferlin-deficient muscle upregulates TSP-1 in vivoand in vitro and indicate that endogenous chemotactic factors arecrucial to the sustained inflammatory process observed in dysferlinopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol, collectively referred to as phosphoinositides, occur in the cytoplasmic leaflet of cellular membranes and regulate activities such as vesicle transport, cytoskeletal reorganization and signal transduction. Recent studies have indicated an important role for phosphoinositide metabolism in the aetiology of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, myopathy and inflammation. Although the biological functions of the phosphatases that regulate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)) have been well characterized, little is known about the functions of the phosphatases regulating the closely related molecule phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P(2)). Here we show that inositol polyphosphate phosphatase 4A (INPP4A), a PtdIns(3,4)P(2) phosphatase, is a suppressor of glutamate excitotoxicity in the central nervous system. Targeted disruption of the Inpp4a gene in mice leads to neurodegeneration in the striatum, the input nucleus of the basal ganglia that has a central role in motor and cognitive behaviours. Notably, Inpp4a(-/-) mice show severe involuntary movement disorders. In vitro, Inpp4a gene silencing via short hairpin RNA renders cultured primary striatal neurons vulnerable to cell death mediated by N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs). Mechanistically, INPP4A is found at the postsynaptic density and regulates synaptic NMDAR localization and NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic current. Thus, INPP4A protects neurons from excitotoxic cell death and thereby maintains the functional integrity of the brain. Our study demonstrates that PtdIns(3,4)P(2), PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) and the phosphatases acting on them can have distinct regulatory roles, and provides insight into the unique aspects and physiological significance of PtdIns(3,4)P(2) metabolism. INPP4A represents, to our knowledge, the first signalling protein with a function in neurons to suppress excitotoxic cell death. The discovery of a direct link between PtdIns(3,4)P(2) metabolism and the regulation of neurodegeneration and involuntary movements may aid the development of new approaches for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>This patient presented on the first day of life with pronounced lactic acidosis with an elevated lactate/pyruvate ratio. Urine organic acids showed Krebs cycle metabolites and mildly elevated methylmalonate and methylcitrate. The acylcarnitine profile showed elevated propionylcarnitine and succinylcarnitine. Amino acids showed elevated glutamic acid, glutamine, proline, and alanine. From the age 2 of mo on, she had elevated transaminases and intermittent episodes of liver failure. Liver biopsy showed steatosis and a decrease of mitochondrial DNA to 50% of control. She had bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Over the course of the first 2 y of life, she developed a progressively severe myopathy with pronounced muscle weakness eventually leading to respiratory failure, Leigh disease, and recurrent hepatic failure. The hepatic symptoms and the metabolic parameters temporarily improved on treatment with aspartate, but neither muscle symptoms nor brain lesions improved. Laboratory testing revealed a deficiency of succinyl-CoA ligase enzyme activity and protein in fibroblasts because of a novel homozygous mutation in the SUCLG1 gene: c.40A>T (p.M14L). Functional analysis suggests that this methionine is more likely to function as the translation initiator methionine, explaining the pathogenic nature of the mutation. Succinyl-CoA ligase deficiency due to an SUCLG1 mutation is a new cause for mitochondrial hepatoencephalomyopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report the case of a male who presented in infancy with motor delay and muscle weakness. Typical muscle biopsy features and heterozygous RYR1 mutation confirmed a diagnosis of central core disease. Family studies showed this to be a de-novo mutation. Some years later, his two older teenage brothers presented with proximal muscle weakness. Neurophysiology, muscle biopsy and DNA studies confirmed spinal muscular atrophy. Subsequent genetic studies in the index case also confirmed homozygous deletions of exon 7 and 8 in the SMN gene. Review of the original muscle biopsy showed classical features of central core disease with no evidence to suggest denervation, such that the diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy could not have been suspected in the absence of the family history.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Most human ACTA1 skeletal actin gene mutations cause dominant, congenital myopathies often with severely reduced muscle function and neonatal mortality. High sequence conservation of actin means many mutated ACTA1 residues are identical to those in the DrosophilaAct88F, an indirect flight muscle specific sarcomeric actin. Four known Act88F mutations occur at the same actin residues mutated in ten ACTA1 nemaline mutations, A138D/P, R256H/L, G268C/D/R/S and R372C/S. These Act88F mutants were examined for similar muscle phenotypes. Mutant homozygotes show phenotypes ranging from a lack of myofibrils to almost normal sarcomeres at eclosion. Aberrant Z-disc-like structures and serial Z-disc arrays, 'zebra bodies', are observed in homozygotes and heterozygotes of all four Act88F mutants. These electron-dense structures show homologies to human nemaline bodies/rods, but are much smaller than those typically found in the human myopathy. We conclude that the Drosophila indirect flight muscles provide a good model system for studying ACTA1 mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the intermediate filament protein desmin cause a distinct class of myofibrillar myopathies that are characterized by deposition of aggregated desmin. To assess the effect of different disease-associated mutations at the molecular level, we applied confocal single-particle fluorescence spectroscopy. We studied the de novo aggregation properties of desmin in vitro and the aggregation state of desmin in homogenates of transfected cells rendering purification unnecessary. We detected divergent assembly patterns for 3 different desmin missense mutations. R350P-desmin showed a strong inhibition of assembly formation that was associated with a reduced level of tetramers and an increase in dimers in native cell extracts. E413K-desmin formed hyperstable tetramers. For R454W-desmin, there were subtle effects on assembly at the dimer and tetramer levels by single-particle spectroscopy that are not detectable by classical fluorescence microscopy. We also found that R350P-desmin efficiently interacts with the wild-type protein resulting in a dominant-negative effect on desmin assembly. Taken together, these results provide a molecular basis for a detailed functional classification of mutations in the desmin gene. The findings may also have implications for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for primary desminopathies based on the different molecular events that disrupt physiological filament formation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: The c.2447G>A (p.R722H) mutation in the gene POLG1 of the catalytic subunit of human mitochondrial polymerase gamma has been previously found in a few occasions but its pathogenicity has remained uncertain. We set out to ascertain its contribution to neuromuscular disease. METHODS: Probands from two families with probable mitochondrial disease were examined clinically, muscle and buccal epithelial DNA were analyzed for mtDNA deletions, and the POLG1, POLG2, ANT1 and Twinkle genes were sequenced. RESULTS: An adult proband presented with progressive external ophthalmoplegia, sensorineural hearing impairment, diabetes mellitus, dysphagia, a limb myopathy and dementia. Brain MRI showed central and cortical atrophy, and 18F-deoxyglucose PET revealed reduced glucose uptake. Histochemical analysis of muscle disclosed ragged red fibers and cytochrome c oxidase-negative fibers. Electron microscopy showed subsarcolemmal aggregates of morphologically normal mitochondria. Multiple mtDNA deletions were found in the muscle, and sequencing of the POLG1 gene revealed a homozygous c.2447G>A (p.R722H) mutation. His two siblings were also homozygous with respect to the p.R722H mutation and presented with dementia and sensorineural hearing impairment. In another family the p.R722H mutation was found as compound heterozygosity with the common p.W748S mutation in two siblings with mental retardation, ptosis, epilepsy and psychiatric symptoms. The estimated carrier frequency of the p.R722H mutation was 1:135 in the Finnish population. No mutations in POLG2, ANT1 and Twinkle genes were found. Analysis of the POLG1 sequence by homology modeling supported the notion that the p.R722H mutation is pathogenic. CONCLUSIONS: The recessive c.2447G>A (p.R722H) mutation in the linker region of the POLG1 gene is pathogenic for multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle and is associated with a late-onset neurological phenotype as a homozygous state. The onset of the disease can be earlier in compound heterozygotes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked centronuclear myopathy (XLMTM), also called myotubular myopathy, is a severe congenital myopathy characterized by generalized hypotonia and weakness at birth and the typical histological finding of centralization of myo-nuclei. It is caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene encoding the 3-phosphoinositides phosphatase myotubularin. Mutations in dynamin 2 and amphiphysin 2 genes lead to autosomal forms of centronuclear myopathy (CNM). While XLMTM is the most frequent and severe form of CNM, no mutations are found in about 30% of patients by sequencing all MTM1 exons. Moreover, the impact of MTM1 sequence variants is sometimes difficult to assess. It is thus important to devise a complete molecular diagnostic strategy that includes analysis of the myotubularin transcript and protein expression. We therefore developed novel antibodies against human myotubularin and showed that they are able to detect the endogenous protein by direct Western blot from muscle samples and from cultured cells. In conjunction with RT-PCR analysis we validated the consequences of missense and splice mutations on transcript integrity and protein level. We also detected and characterized a novel deep intronic mutation consisting of a single nucleotide change that induces exonisation of a conserved intronic sequence. Patients with centronuclear myopathy and no molecular diagnosis should be investigated for MTM1 defects at the cDNA and protein level.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Mutations in the gene encoding desmin (DES), an intermediate filament protein, underlie a heterogeneous phenotype, which is referred to as desmin-related myopathy (DRM). Right ventricular involvement including an arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)(-like) phenotype has occasionally been described in DES mutation-carrying patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of a DES missense mutation on the structure of different intercalated disk proteins, to evaluate right ventricular involvement in DES mutation carriers, and to establish the role of DES mutations in ARVC(-like) phenotypes. METHODS: We evaluated the clinical phenotype in two families carrying two different DES mutations. One family was diagnosed with DRM, with an ARVC(-like) phenotype in one patient, while the other family presented with a severe biventricular cardiomyopathy. Additional immunohistochemistry of desmosomal proteins was performed in myocardial tissue from two patients of the last family. The DES gene was screened for mutations in 50 ARVC(-like) patients. RESULTS: Except for two different DES mutations (p.N342D and p.R454W) in two families with DRM and severe biventricular cardiomyopathy, respectively, we did not find additional DES mutations in ARVC(-like) patients. In addition to desmin aggregates, immunohistochemistry demonstrated a decreased amount of desmoplakin and plakophilin-2 at the intercalated disk in p.R454W mutation carriers. CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that either an ARVC-like phenotype or a severe cardiomyopathy with right ventricular involvement are possible, yet infrequent, cardiac phenotypes in DRM. Moreover, we demonstrated that the DES mutation p.R454W affects the localization of desmoplakin and plakophilin-2 at the intercalated disk, suggesting a link between desmosomal cardiomyopathies (mainly affecting the right ventricle) and cardiomyopathies caused by DES mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Striated muscle myosin heavy chain is a molecular motor protein that converts chemical energy into mechanical force. It is a major determinant of the physiological properties of each of the three muscle fibre types that make up the skeletal muscles. Heterozygous dominant missense mutations in myosin heavy chain genes cause various types of cardiomyopathy and skeletal myopathy, but the effects of myosin heavy chain null mutations in humans have not previously been reported. We have identified the first patients lacking fast type 2A muscle fibres, caused by total absence of fast myosin heavy chain IIa protein due to truncating mutations of the corresponding gene MYH2. Five adult patients, two males and three females, from three unrelated families in UK and Finland were clinically assessed and muscle biopsy was performed in one patient from each family. MYH2 was sequenced and the expression of the corresponding transcripts and protein was analysed in muscle tissue. The patients had early-onset symptoms characterized by mild generalized muscle weakness, extraocular muscle involvement and relatively favourable prognosis. Muscle biopsy revealed myopathic changes including variability of fibre size, internalized nuclei, and increased interstitial connective and adipose tissue. No muscle fibres expressing type IIa myosin heavy chain were identified and the MYH2 transcripts were markedly reduced. All patients were compound heterozygous for truncating mutations in MYH2. The parents were unaffected, consistent with recessive mutations. Our findings show that null mutations in the fast myosin heavy chain IIa gene cause early onset myopathy and demonstrate that this isoform is necessary for normal muscle development and function. The relatively mild phenotype is interesting in relation to the more severe phenotypes generally seen in relation to recessive null mutations in sarcomeric proteins.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A deficiency of the dysferlin protein results in limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and Miyoshi myopathy, with resulting plasma membrane abnormalities in myofibers. Many patients show muscle inflammation, but the molecular mechanisms that initiate and perpetuate this inflammation are not well understood. We previously showed abnormal activation of macrophages and hypothesized that activation of the inflammasome pathway may play a role in disease progression. To test this, we studied the inflammasome molecular platform in dysferlin-deficient human and mouse muscle. Consistent with our model, components of the NACHT, LRR and PYD-containing proteins (NALP)-3 inflammasome pathway were specifically up-regulated and activated in dysferlin-deficient but not in dystrophin-deficient and normal muscle. We demonstrate for the first time that normal primary skeletal muscle cells are capable of secreting IL-1beta in response to combined treatment with lipopolysaccharide and the P2X7 receptor agonist, benzylated ATP, suggesting that not only immune cells but also muscle cells can actively participate in inflammasome formation. In addition, we show that dysferlin-deficient primary muscle cells express toll-like receptors (TLRs; TLR-2 and TLR-4) and can efficiently produce IL-1beta in response to lipopolysaccharide and benzylated ATP. These data indicate that skeletal muscle is an active contributor of IL-1beta and strategies that interfere with this pathway may be therapeutically useful for patients with limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlin is a type II transmembrane protein implicated in surface membrane repair in muscle. Mutations in dysferlin lead to limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B, Miyoshi Myopathy and distal anterior compartment myopathy. Dysferlin's mode of action is not well understood and only a few protein binding partners have thus far been identified. Using affinity purification followed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, we identified alpha-tubulin as a novel binding partner for dysferlin. The association between dysferlin and alpha-tubulin, as well as between dysferlin and microtubules, was confirmed in vitro by glutathione S-transferase pulldown and microtubule binding assays. These interactions were confirmed in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation. Confocal microscopy revealed that dysferlin and alpha-tubulin co-localized in the perinuclear region and in vesicular structures in myoblasts, and along thin longitudinal structures reminiscent of microtubules in myotubes. We mapped dysferlin's alpha-tubulin-binding region to its C2A and C2B domains. Modulation of calcium levels did not affect dysferlin binding to alpha-tubulin, suggesting that this interaction is calcium-independent. Our studies identified a new binding partner for dysferlin and suggest a role for microtubules in dysferlin trafficking to the sarcolemma.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotubularins are a family of dual-specificity phosphatases that act to modify phosphoinositides and regulate membrane traffic. Mutations in several myotubularins are associated with human disease. Sequence changes in MTM1 and MTMR14 (also known as Jumpy) have been detected in patients with a severe skeletal myopathy called centronuclear myopathy. MTM1 has been characterized in vitro and in several model systems, while the function of MTMR14 and its specific role in muscle development and disease is much less well understood. We have previously reported that knockdown of zebrafish MTM1 results in significantly impaired motor function and severe histopathologic changes in skeletal muscle that are characteristic of human centronuclear myopathy. In the current study, we examine zebrafish MTMR14 using gene dosage manipulation. As with MTM1 knockdown, morpholino-mediated knockdown of MTMR14 results in morphologic abnormalities, a developmental motor phenotype characterized by diminished spontaneous contractions and abnormal escape response, and impaired excitation-contraction coupling. In contrast to MTM1 knockdown, however, muscle ultrastructure is unaffected. Double knockdown of both MTM1 and MTMR14 significantly impairs motor function and alters skeletal muscle ultrastructure. The combined effect of reducing levels of both MTMR14 and MTM1 is significantly more severe than either knockdown alone, an effect which is likely mediated, at least in part, by increased autophagy. In all, our results suggest that MTMR14 is required for motor function and, in combination with MTM1, is required for myocyte homeostasis and normal embryonic development.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A possible role of allelic variation of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG1) gene in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been suggested. First, POLG1 missense mutations have been found in patients with familial parkinsonism and mitochondrial myopathy. Second, increased frequency of rare alleles of the POLG1 CAG-repeat (poly-Q) has been found in Finnish idiopathic apparently sporadic PD patients, but conflicting reports exist. The POLG1 poly-Q exhibits one major allele with 10 repeats (10Q, frequency >/=80%) and several less common alleles such as 11Q (frequency 6-9%), 6Q-9Q and 12Q-14Q (frequencies &lt;4%). It is not known, whether the poly-Q variation modulates POLG1 function. Here we sequenced the poly-Q in 641 North American Caucasian PD patients and 292 controls. Caucasian literature controls were also used. Normal allele was defined either as 10/11Q or as 10Q according to the previous literature. The frequency of the non-10/11Q alleles in cases was not significantly different from the controls. Variant alleles defined as non-10Q were significantly increased in the PD patients compared to the North American controls (17.6% vs. 12.3%, p=0.004) as well as compared to the larger set of 897 controls (17.6% vs. 13.2%, p=0.0007). These results suggest that POLG1 poly-Q alleles other than the conserved 10Q allele may increase susceptibility to PD. This finding may be attributable to a beneficial function of the 10Q repeat protein or linkage disequilibrium between the 10Q allele and another variation within or close to POLG1. Other large case-control studies and analyses on functional differences of POLG1 poly-Q variants are warranted.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) regulates the catabolism of sialoglycoconjugates in lysosomes. Congenital NEU1 deficiency in children is the basis of sialidosis, a severe neurosomatic disorder in which patients experience a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations varying in the age of onset and severity. Osteoskeletal deformities and muscle hypotonia have been described in patients with sialidosis. Here we present the first comprehensive analysis of the skeletal muscle pathology associated with loss of Neu1 function in mice. In this animal model, skeletal muscles showed an expansion of the epimysial and perimysial spaces, associated with proliferation of fibroblast-like cells and abnormal deposition of collagens. Muscle fibers located adjacent to the expanded connective tissue underwent extensive invagination of their sarcolemma, which resulted in the infiltration of the fibers by fibroblast-like cells and extracellular matrix, and in their progressive cytosolic fragmentation. Both the expanded connective tissue and the juxtaposed infiltrated muscle fibers were strongly positive for lysosomal markers and displayed increased proteolytic activity of lysosomal cathepsins and metalloproteinases. These combined features could lead to abnormal remodeling of the extracellular matrix that could be responsible for sarcolemmal invagination and progressive muscle fiber degeneration, ultimately resulting in an overt atrophic phenotype. This unique pattern of muscle damage, which has never been described in any myopathy, might explain the neuromuscular manifestations reported in patients with the type II severe form of sialidosis. More broadly, these findings point to a potential role of NEU1 in cell proliferation and extracellular matrix remodeling.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: HIBM (Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy) is a recessive hereditary disease characterized by adult-onset, slowly progressive muscle weakness sparing the quadriceps. It is caused by a single missense mutation of each allele of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene, a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing the first two steps of sialic acid synthesis in mammals. However, the mechanisms and cellular pathways affected by the GNE mutation and causing the muscle weakness could not be identified so far. Based on recent evidence in literature, we investigated a new hypothesis, i.e. the involvement in the disease of the GM3 ganglioside, a specific glycolipid implicated in muscle cell proliferation and differentiation. METHODS: qRT-PCR analysis of St3gal5 (GM3 synthase) gene expression and HPLC quantification of GM3 ganglioside were conducted on muscle tissue from a mouse model of HIBM harboring the M712T mutation of GNE (Gne(M712T/M712T) mouse) vs control mice (Gne(+/+) mouse). RESULTS: St3gal5 mRNA levels were significantly lower in Gne(M712T/M712T) mouse muscles vs Gne(+/+) mouse muscles (64.41%+/-10% of Gne(+/+) levels). GM3 ganglioside levels showed also a significant decrease in Gne(M712T/M712T) mouse muscle compared to Gne(+/+) mouse muscle (18.09%+/-5.33% of Gne(+/+) levels). Although these Gne(M712T/M712T) mice were described to suffer severe glomerular proteinuria, no GM3 alterations were noted in kidneys, highlighting a tissue specific alteration of gangliosides. CONCLUSION: The M712T mutation of GNE hampers the muscle ability to synthesize normal levels of GM3. This is the first time that a mutation of GNE can be related to the molecular pathological mechanism of HIBM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. Genetic defect of SCAD was documented to cause clinical symptoms such as progressive psychomotor retardation, muscle hypotonia, and myopathy in early reports. However, clinical significance of SCAD deficiency (SCADD) has been getting ambiguous, for some variants in the ACADS gene, which encodes the SCAD protein, has turned out to be widely prevailed among general populations. Accordingly, the pathophysiology of SCADD has not been clarified thus far. The present report focuses on two suspected cases of SCADD detected through the screening of newborns by tandem mass spectrometry. In both subjects, compound heterozygous mutations in ACADS were detected. The mutated genes were expressed in a transient gene expression system, and the enzymatic activities of the obtained mutant SCAD proteins were measured. The activities of the mutant SCAD proteins were significantly lower than that of the wild-type enzyme, confirming the mechanism underlying the diagnosis of SCADD in both subjects. Moreover, the mutant SCAD proteins gave rise to mitochondrial fragmentation and autophagy, both of which were proportional to the decrease in SCAD activities. The association of autophagy with programmed cell death suggests that the mutant SCAD proteins are toxic to mitochondria and to the cells in which they are expressed. The expression of recombinant ACADS-encoded mutant proteins offers a technique to evaluate both the nature of the defective SCAD proteins and their toxicity. Moreover, our results provide insight into possible molecular pathophysiology of SCADD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: The dose-response effects of dysferlin transgenesis were analyzed to determine if the dysferlin-deficient myopathies are good candidates for gene replacement therapy. METHODS: We have generated 3 lines of transgenic mice, expressing low, mid, and high levels of full-length human dysferlin from a muscle-specific promoter. Transgenic skeletal muscle was analyzed and scored for morphological and functional deficits. RESULTS: Overexpression of dysferlin in mice resulted in a striking phenotype of kyphosis, irregular gait, and reduced muscle mass and strength. Moreover, protein dosage correlated with phenotype severity. In contrast to dysferlin-null skeletal muscle, no evidence of sarcolemmal impairment was revealed. Rather, increased levels of Ca(2+)-regulated, dysferlin-binding proteins and endoplasmic reticulum stress chaperone proteins were observed in muscle lysates from transgenic mice as compared with controls. INTERPRETATION: Expression levels of dysferlin are important for appropriate function without deleterious or cytotoxic effects. As a corollary, we propose that future endeavors in gene replacement for correction of dysferlinopathy should be tailored to take account of this.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In skeletal muscle, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) is a critical negative regulator of the MAPKs. Since the MAPKs have been reported to be both positive and negative for myogenesis, the physiological role of MKP-1 in skeletal muscle repair and regeneration has remained unclear. Here, we show that MKP-1 plays an essential role in adult regenerative myogenesis. In a cardiotoxin-induced muscle injury model, lack of MKP-1 impaired muscle regeneration. In mdx mice, MKP-1 deficiency reduced body weight, muscle mass, and muscle fiber cross-sectional area. In addition, MKP-1-deficient muscles exhibit exacerbated myopathy accompanied by increased inflammation. Lack of MKP-1 compromised myoblast proliferation and induced precocious differentiation, phenotypes that were rescued by pharmacological inhibition of p38alpha/beta MAPK. MKP-1 coordinates both myoblast proliferation and differentiation. Mechanistically, MyoD bound to the MKP-1 promoter and activated MKP-1 expression in proliferating myoblasts. Later, during myogenesis, MyoD uncoupled from the MKP-1 promoter leading to the down-regulation of MKP-1 and facilitation of promyogenic p38alpha/beta MAPK signaling. Hence, MKP-1 plays a critical role in muscle stem cells and in the immune response to coordinate muscle repair and regeneration.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Lipid storage myopathies (LSMs) are characterized pathologically by the accumulation of lipid droplets in muscle fibers due to impaired cellular lipid metabolism. The purpose of this study was to determine etiologies and genetic mutations associated with LSMs in ethnic Han Taiwanese. The usefulness of the blood acylcarnitine (AC) profile for diagnosing LSMs in adult patients was also investigated. Nine patients were diagnosed with late-onset LSMs following a review of muscle biopsies and medical records and were recruited retrospectively. Genetic studies were performed to detect mutations in the SLC22A5 for primary carnitine deficiency, PNPLA2 for neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy, ABHD5 for neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis, ETFDH for multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenation deficiency (MADD), and CPT2 for carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency. Blood AC levels were measured by tandem mass spectrometry. The mutation c.250G>A in ETFDH was detected in seven (78%) patients, six of whom were homozygous for the variant. Patients with ETFDH mutations had elevated blood levels of ACs ranging from C8 to C16 species, a pattern consistent with MADD. ETFDH c.250G>A mutation is common in Taiwanese patients with late-onset LSMs. The blood AC profile is a sensitive biochemical marker for diagnosing MADD arising from ETFDH mutations in adults.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) is a clinically variable and genetically heterogeneous disease that is characterized by mild short stature and early onset osteoarthritis. Autosomal dominant forms are caused by mutations in the genes that encode type IX collagen, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, and matrilin-3: COL9A1, COL9A2, COL9A3, COMP, and MATN3, respectively. Splicing mutations have been identified in all three genes encoding type IX collagen and are restricted to specific exons encoding an equivalent region of the COL3 domain in all three alpha(IX) chains. MED has been associated with mild myopathy in some families, in particular one family with a COL9A3 mutation and two families with C-terminal COMP mutations. In this study we have identified COL9A2 mutations in two families with MED that also have osteochondritis dissecans and mild myopathy. This study therefore extends the range of gene-mutations that can cause MED-related myopathy. (c) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Congenital myopathies are a group of genetic disorders characterized by generalised muscle hypotonia and weakness of varying severity. They are distinct entities and do not include muscular dystrophies, metabolic myopathies and mitochondrial disorders. Myotubular myopathy is a rare sub type within this group of disorders. Clinical differentiation of the various types is difficult and requires muscle biopsy with histopathological and immunohistochemical studies for specific diagnosis. Gene studies are a prerequisite for genetic counseling adn prenatal diagnosis. Here presented three cases of X-linked myotubular myopathy in three Indian families where the diagnosis was established by mutation analysis in the MTM1 gene in all, and supported his histopathology in two. All three families had history of previous male neonatal deaths with similar complaints. Molecular analysis revealed hemizygous mutations in the MTM1 gene including c.1261-10A>G in case, 1, c.70C>T (R24X) in case 2, and a previously unreported mutation, c.924_926delCTT(p. F308del), in case 3. Genetic counseling was performed regarding the X-linked inheritance, their 50% risk of recurrence in boys in subsequent pregnancies, and a feasibility of prenatal diagnosis. This is the first report of cases of X-linked myotubular myopathy from India.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Autosomal-recessive hereditary inclusion-body myopathy with relative quadriceps sparing is associated with mutations in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene. Two Italian sisters affected with autosomal-recessive hIBM were shown to be compound heterozygous for a novel GNE mutation: a p.A310P amino acid change along with a p.R246W mutation on the second allele both in the epimerase domain. This is the first mutation event observed in a human GNE allele inducing a proline. Muscle biopsy showed abundant rimmed and non-rimmed vacuoles. Severe disease progression was noted in the elder sister. The Italian family further expands the wide phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of hIBM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Collagen VI is an integral part of the skeletal muscle extracellular matrix, providing mechanical stability and facilitating matrix-dependent cell signaling. Mutations in collagen VI result in either Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) or Bethlem myopathy (BM), with UCMD being clinically more severe. Recent studies demonstrating increased apoptosis and abnormal mitochondrial function in Col6a1 knockout mice and in human myoblasts have provided the first mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of these diseases. However, how loss of collagen VI causes mitochondrial dysfunction remains to be understood. Progress is hindered in part by the lack of an adequate animal model for UCMD, as knockout mice have a mild motor phenotype. To further the understanding of these disorders, we have generated zebrafish models of the collagen VI myopathies. Morpholinos designed to exon 9 of col6a1 produced a severe muscle disease reminiscent of UCMD, while ones to exon 13 produced a milder phenotype similar to BM. UCMD-like zebrafish have increased cell death and abnormal mitochondria, which can be attenuated by treatment with the proton pump modifier cyclosporin A (CsA). CsA improved the motor deficits in UCMD-like zebrafish, but failed to reverse the sarcolemmal membrane damage. In all, we have successfully generated the first vertebrate model matching the clinical severity of UCMD and demonstrated that CsA provides phenotypic improvement, thus corroborating data from knockout mice supporting the use of mitochondrial permeability transition pore modifiers as therapeutics in patients, and providing proof of principle for the utility of the zebrafish as a powerful preclinical model.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The best established role of acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7, AChE) is termination of neurotransmission at cholinergic synapses. However, AChE is also located at sites, where no other cholinergic components are present and there is accumulating evidence for non-cholinergic functions of this protein. In the process of skeletal muscle formation, AChE is expressed already at the stage of mononuclear myoblast, which is long before other cholinergic components can be demonstrated in this tissue. Myoblast proliferation is an essential step in muscle regeneration and is always accompanied by apoptosis. Since there are several reports demonstrating AChE participation in apoptosis one can hypothesize that early AChE expression in myoblasts reflects the development of the apoptotic apparatus in these cells. Here we tested this hypothesis by following the effect of siRNA AChE silencing on apoptotic markers and by determination of AChE level after staurosporine-induced apoptosis in cultured human myoblasts. Decreased apoptosis in siRNA AChE silenced myoblasts and increased AChE expression in staurosporine-treated myoblasts confirmed AChE involvement in apoptosis. The three AChE splice variants were differently affected by staurosporine-induced apoptosis. The hydrophobic (H) variant appeared unaffected, a tendency towards increase of tailed (T) variant was detected, however the highest, 8-fold increase was observed for readthrough (R) variant. In the light of these findings AChE appears to be a potential therapeutic target at muscle injuries including organophosphate myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Mitochondrial disturbances of energygenerating systems in childhood are a heterogeneous group of disorders. The aim of this multi-site survey was to characterise the natural course of a novel mitochondrial disease with ATP synthase deficiency and mutation in the TMEM70 gene. METHODS: Retrospective clinical data and metabolic profiles were collected and evaluated in 25 patients (14 boys, 11 girls) from seven European countries with a c.317-2A-->G mutation in the TMEM70 gene. RESULTS: Severe muscular hypotonia (in 92% of newborns), apnoic spells (92%), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCMP; 76%) and profound lactic acidosis (lactate 5-36 mmol/l; 92%) with hyperammonaemia (100-520 micromol/l; 86%) were present from birth. Ten patients died within the first 6 weeks of life. Most patients surviving the neonatal period had persisting muscular hypotonia and developed psychomotor delay. HCMP was non-progressive and even disappeared in some children. Hypospadia was present in 54% of the boys and cryptorchidism in 67%. Increased excretion of lactate and 3-methylglutaconic acid (3-MGC) was observed in all patients. In four surviving patients, life-threatening hyperammonaemia occurred during childhood, triggered by acute gastroenteritis and prolonged fasting. CONCLUSIONS: ATP synthase deficiency with mutation in TMEM70 should be considered in the diagnosis and management of critically ill neonates with early neonatal onset of muscular hypotonia, HCMP and hypospadias in boys accompanied by lactic acidosis, hyperammonaemia and 3-MGC-uria. However, phenotype severity may vary significantly. The disease occurs frequently in the Roma population and molecular-genetic analysis of the TMEM70 gene is sufficient for diagnosis without need of muscle biopsy in affected children.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report the first Australian families with inclusion-body myopathy, Paget's disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). The clinical characteristics of the two pedigrees are described including a previously undescribed phenotypic feature of pyramidal tract dysfunction in one family member. A novel mutation in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene (p.Arg155Leu) was found in one family while the other family had a previously reported mutation (p.Leu198Trp). Our findings broaden the phenotypic spectrum of IBMPFD and further emphasise the resemblance to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in some cases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To assess the expression of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) and TLR-7 in muscle tissue from patients with polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM) and to investigate the function and regulation of TLR-3 in cultured muscle cells. METHODS: The expression of TLR-3, TLR-7, HLA class I, and CD56, a marker of immature myoblast precursors, was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. TLR-3 regulation and signaling were assessed in myoblasts and in differentiated myotubes with the TLR-3 agonist poly(I-C), necrotic myoblasts, and Th1 and Th17 cytokines, in the presence or absence of neutralizing anti-TLR-3 antibody. Levels of TLR-3 messenger RNA (mRNA) were quantified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), CCL20, and IL-8 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: TLR-3 and TLR-7 were expressed in PM/DM tissues, but not in noninflammatory muscle tissues, and were primarily detected in inflammatory infiltrates, although a few muscle cells were also positive. These TLR-3- and TLR-7-positive fibers expressed high levels of CD56 and HLA class I antigens. A synergy between poly(I-C) and IL-17 was observed for the production of IL-6 and CCL20. Similarly, stimulation with necrotic myoblasts increased IL-6 production, and stimulation with necrotic myoblasts in combination with IL-17 further increased the induction of IL-6. TLR-3 blockade decreased the inducing effect of necrotic myoblasts and IL-17 on IL-6 production. Stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) increased TLR-3 mRNA levels, but IL-17 down-regulated the inducing effect of IFNgamma. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that TLR-3 and TLR-7 are expressed in inflammatory myopathic tissues, particularly in immature myoblast precursors. Necrotic muscle cells activate cytokine production, in part, through the TLR-3 pathway, with a differential regulatory effect of Th1 and Th17 cytokines.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Molecular characterization of collagen-VI related myopathies currently relies on standard sequencing, which yields a detection rate approximating 75-79% in Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) and 60-65% in Bethlem myopathy (BM) patients as PCR-based techniques tend to miss gross genomic rearrangements as well as copy number variations (CNVs) in both the coding sequence and intronic regions. METHODS: We have designed a custom oligonucleotide CGH array in order to investigate the presence of CNVs in the coding and non-coding regions of COL6A1, A2, A3, A5 and A6 genes and a group of genes functionally related to collagen VI. A cohort of 12 patients with UCMD/BM negative at sequencing analysis and 2 subjects carrying a single COL6 mutation whose clinical phenotype was not explicable by inheritance were selected and the occurrence of allelic and genetic heterogeneity explored. RESULTS: A deletion within intron 1A of the COL6A2 gene, occurring in compound heterozygosity with a small deletion in exon 28, previously detected by routine sequencing, was identified in a BM patient. RNA studies showed monoallelic transcription of the COL6A2 gene, thus elucidating the functional effect of the intronic deletion. No pathogenic mutations were identified in the remaining analyzed patients, either within COL6A genes, or in genes functionally related to collagen VI. CONCLUSIONS: Our custom CGH array may represent a useful complementary diagnostic tool, especially in recessive forms of the disease, when only one mutant allele is detected by standard sequencing. The intronic deletion we identified represents the first example of a pure intronic mutation in COL6A genes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (IBM2) was mainly reported in Middle Eastern Jewish patients. Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles has been described as a worldwide distributed distal myopathy. Both diseases are caused by mutations of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene. Herein we report two patients: an Egyptian Muslim patient with the "common" Middle Eastern mutation (M712T), rarely described in non-Jewish patients; and an Italian patient carrying a novel GNE mutation (L179F) in the epimerase domain. Our patients share common clinical and histopathological features, with some interesting aspects. The first patient presented a clinical deterioration during her first pregnancy confirming that an increased requirement of sialic acid during pregnancy may trigger a clinical worsening. The second patient showed a slowly progressive deterioration, different from other patients carrying mutations in the epimerase domain, who had a severe and rapid progression.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We investigated eight families with a novel subtype of congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL4) of whom five members had died from sudden cardiac death during their teenage years. ECG studies revealed features of long-QT syndrome, bradycardia, as well as supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias. Further symptoms comprised myopathy with muscle rippling, skeletal as well as smooth-muscle hypertrophy, leading to impaired gastrointestinal motility and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in some children. Additionally, we found impaired bone formation with osteopenia, osteoporosis, and atlanto-axial instability. Homozygosity mapping located the gene within 2 Mbp on chromosome 17. Prioritization of 74 candidate genes with GeneDistiller for high expression in muscle and adipocytes suggested PTRF-CAVIN (Polymerase I and transcript release factor/Cavin) as the most probable candidate leading to the detection of homozygous mutations (c.160delG, c.362dupT). PTRF-CAVIN is essential for caveolae biogenesis. These cholesterol-rich plasmalemmal vesicles are involved in signal-transduction and vesicular trafficking and reside primarily on adipocytes, myocytes, and osteoblasts. Absence of PTRF-CAVIN did not influence abundance of its binding partner caveolin-1 and caveolin-3. In patient fibroblasts, however, caveolin-1 failed to localize toward the cell surface and electron microscopy revealed reduction of caveolae to less than 3%. Transfection of full-length PTRF-CAVIN reestablished the presence of caveolae. The loss of caveolae was confirmed by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) in combination with fluorescent imaging. PTRF-CAVIN deficiency thus presents the phenotypic spectrum caused by a quintessential lack of functional caveolae.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2G (LGMD2G) is an adult-onset myopathy characterized by distal lower limb weakness, calf hypertrophy and progressive decline in ambulation. The disease is caused by mutations in Tcap, a z-disc protein of skeletal muscle, although the precise mechanisms resulting in clinical symptoms are unknown. To provide a model for preclinical trials and for mechanistic studies, we generated knockout (KO) mice carrying a null mutation in the Tcap gene. Here we present the first report of a Tcap KO mouse model for LGMD2G and the results of an investigation into the effects of Tcap deficiency on skeletal muscle function in 4- and 12-month-old mice. Muscle histology of Tcap-null mice revealed abnormal myofiber size variation with central nucleation, similar to findings in the muscles of LGMD2G patients. An analysis of a Tcap binding protein, myostatin, showed that deletion of Tcap was accompanied by increased protein levels of myostatin. Our Tcap-null mice exhibited a decline in the ability to maintain balance on a rotating rod, relative to wild-type controls. No differences were detected in force or fatigue assays of isolated extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus (SOL) muscles. Finally, a mechanical investigation of EDL and SOL indicated an increase in muscle stiffness in KO animals. We are the first to establish a viable KO mouse model of Tcap deficiency and our model mice demonstrate a dystrophic phenotype comparable to humans with LGMD2G.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in dynamin-2 (DNM2) cause autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (CNM). We report a series of 12 patients from eight families with CNM in whom we have identified a number of novel features that expand the reported clinicopathological phenotype. We identified two novel and five recurrent missense mutations in DNM2. Early clues to the diagnosis include relative weakness of neck flexors, external ophthalmoplegia and ptosis, although these are not present in all patients. Pes cavus was present in two patients, and in another two members of one family there was mild slowing of nerve conduction velocities. Whole-body MRI examination in two children and one adult revealed a similar pattern of involvement of selective muscles in head (lateral pterygoids), neck (extensors), trunk (paraspinal) and upper limbs (deep muscles of forearm). Findings in lower limbs and pelvic region were similar to that previously reported in adults with DNM2 mutations. Two patients presented with dystrophic changes as the predominant pathological feature on muscle biopsies; one of whom had a moderately raised creatine kinase, and both patients were initially diagnosed as congenital muscular dystrophy. DNM2 mutation analysis should be considered in patients with a suggestive clinical phenotype despite atypical histopathology, and MRI findings can be used to guide genetic testing. Subtle neuropathic features in some patients suggest an overlap with the DNM2 neuropathy phenotype. Missense mutations in the C-terminal region of the PH domain appear to be associated with a more severe clinical phenotype evident from infancy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial disorders result from primary defects in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or from defects in nuclear genes which cause disease by affecting the mtDNA. POLG1 is a nuclear gene which encodes for the catalytic subunit of the mtDNA polymerase gamma, essential for mtDNA replication. Less than a decade ago, POLG1 mutations were discovered in patients with progressive external ophthalmoplegia. Since then, it has emerged that POLG1 mutations can result in a spectrum of clinical manifestations, resulting in autosomal recessive or dominant mitochondrial diseases. REVIEW SUMMARY: Here we summarize the common clinical phenotypes associated with POLG1 mutations. Alpers syndrome, progressive external ophthalmoplegia with or without limb myopathy, ataxia-neuropathy syndrome, and epilepsy are frequent clinical manifestations of the POLG1-related disease. Childhood progressive encephalopathy, Parkinsonism, stroke-like events, and isolated exercise intolerance can occur in association with POLG1 mutations. Muscle biopsy can show signs of mitochondrial dysfunction by histologic and biochemical studies or it can be unrevealing. mtDNA analysis of affected tissues can reveal depletion, multiple deletions or point mutations, but it can be occasionally noninformative by routine analysis. CONCLUSIONS: : POLG1 mutations result in extremely heterogenous phenotypes which often have overlapping clinical findings, making it difficult to categorize patients into syndromes. The lack of signs of mitochondrial dysfunction in the muscle biopsy does not exclude a POLG1-related disease. Analysis of mtDNA of clinically affected tissues is often informative, but not always. Molecular analysis of POLG1 is essential when POLG1-related disease is suspected. Sodium valproate should be avoided because of the risk of liver failure.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We present a comprehensive report of two siblings with hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM). The clinical features and histological characteristics of the muscle biopsies showed the typical pattern of predominantly distal vacuolar myopathy with quadriceps sparing. This was confirmed by muscle MRI. PNA lectin staining showed an increased signal at the sarcolemma in patient muscle sections compared to control muscle, indicating reduced sialylation of glycoconjugates. Mutation analysis revealed compound heterozygous mutations in the GNE gene, encoding the key enzyme in sialic acid synthesis UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase: a missense mutation (c.2086G > A; p.V696M) previously described in HIBM patients of Indian origin, and a novel frame shift mutation (c.1295delA; p.K432RfsX17) leading to a premature stopcodon. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of HIBM on the histological, molecular and biochemical level.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Danon disease is an X-linked dominant disorder characterized by the clinical triad of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, and variable mental retardation. Pathologically, autophagic vacuoles are noted in both skeletal and cardiac muscle. It exhibits an X-linked dominant mode of inheritance, and male carriers are severely affected, whereas female carriers develop milder and later-onset cardiac symptoms. Danon disease has been associated with mutations in the lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2 (LAMP2) gene located at Xq24, typically resulting in splicing defects or protein truncation affecting the LAMP2. Because of its rarity, the full spectrum of genetic mutation resulting in Danon disease has not been elucidated. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed 3 male cases with clinical and pathological findings consistent with Danon disease. Comprehensive mutational analysis failed to yield detectable products for selected LAMP2 exons, and genomic DNA deletion was suspected. Genomic junction fragment polymerase chain reaction analysis in case 1 identified a novel Alu-mediated 34-kb microdeletion encompassing the entire 5'-untranslated region and exon 1 of LAMP2. In case 2 and 3, junctional polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analyses mapped the breakpoint to an MIRb and (TA)(n) simple repeats present in intron 3, which determined a 64-kb and a 58-kb deletion, respectively, thereby ablating exons 4 to 10. Western blot analysis confirmed the absence of LAMP2 in protein extract from lymphocytes of index case 2. CONCLUSIONS: This article is the first report of Danon disease caused by microdeletions at Xq24, which functionally ablate LAMP2. The microdeletion mechanism appears to involve 1 Alu-mediated unequal recombination and 2 chromosomal breakage points involving TA-rich repeat sequences.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Additional neurological features have recently been described in seven families transmitting pathogenic mutations in OPA1, the most common cause of autosomal dominant optic atrophy. However, the frequency of these syndromal 'dominant optic atrophy plus' variants and the extent of neurological involvement have not been established. In this large multi-centre study of 104 patients from 45 independent families, including 60 new cases, we show that extra-ocular neurological complications are common in OPA1 disease, and affect up to 20% of all mutational carriers. Bilateral sensorineural deafness beginning in late childhood and early adulthood was a prominent manifestation, followed by a combination of ataxia, myopathy, peripheral neuropathy and progressive external ophthalmoplegia from the third decade of life onwards. We also identified novel clinical presentations with spastic paraparesis mimicking hereditary spastic paraplegia, and a multiple sclerosis-like illness. In contrast to initial reports, multi-system neurological disease was associated with all mutational subtypes, although there was an increased risk with missense mutations [odds ratio = 3.06, 95% confidence interval = 1.44-6.49; P = 0.0027], and mutations located within the guanosine triphosphate-ase region (odds ratio = 2.29, 95% confidence interval = 1.08-4.82; P = 0.0271). Histochemical and molecular characterization of skeletal muscle biopsies revealed the presence of cytochrome c oxidase-deficient fibres and multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions in the majority of patients harbouring OPA1 mutations, even in those with isolated optic nerve involvement. However, the cytochrome c oxidase-deficient load was over four times higher in the dominant optic atrophy + group compared to the pure optic neuropathy group, implicating a causal role for these secondary mitochondrial DNA defects in disease pathophysiology. Individuals with dominant optic atrophy plus phenotypes also had significantly worse visual outcomes, and careful surveillance is therefore mandatory to optimize the detection and management of neurological disability in a group of patients who already have significant visual impairment.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Deficiency of the dysferlin protein presents as two major clinical phenotypes: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and Miyoshi myopathy. Dysferlin is known to participate in membrane repair, providing a potential hypothesis to the underlying pathophysiology of these diseases. The size of the dysferlin cDNA prevents its direct incorporation into an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector for therapeutic gene transfer into muscle. To bypass this limitation, we split the dysferlin cDNA at the exon 28/29 junction and cloned it into two independent AAV vectors carrying the appropriate splicing sequences. Intramuscular injection of the corresponding vectors into a dysferlin-deficient mouse model led to the expression of full-length dysferlin for at least 1 year. Importantly, systemic injection in the tail vein of the two vectors led to a widespread although weak expression of the full-length protein. Injections were associated with an improvement of the histological aspect of the muscle, a reduction in the number of necrotic fibers, restoration of membrane repair capacity and a global improvement in locomotor activity. Altogether, these data support the use of such a strategy for the treatment of dysferlin deficiency.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is a dominantly inherited degenerative disorder caused by mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene. VCP (p97 in mouse, TER94 in Drosophila melanogaster and CDC48 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is a highly conserved AAA(+)-ATPase that regulates a wide array of cellular processes. The mechanism of IBMPFD pathogenesis is unknown. Towards elucidating the pathogenic mechanism we have developed and characterized transgenic mice with ubiquitous expression of wild-type and disease-causing versions of human VCP/p97. Here, we report that mice expressing VCP/p97 harboring the mutations R155H or A232E develop pathology that is limited to muscle, brain and bone, recapitulating the spectrum of disease in humans with IBMPFD. The mice exhibit progressive muscle weakness and pathological examination of muscle shows classic characteristics of inclusion body myopathy including rimmed vacuoles and TDP-43 pathology. The mice exhibit abnormalities in behavioral testing and pathological examination of the brain shows widespread TDP-43 pathology. Furthermore, radiological examination of the skeleton reveals that mutant mice develop severe osteopenia accompanied by focal lytic and sclerotic lesions in vertebrae and femur. In vitro studies indicate that mutant VCP causes inappropriate activation of the NF-kappaB signaling cascade, which could contribute to the mechanism of pathogenesis in multiple tissues including muscle, bone and brain.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Desmin myopathy is a heterogeneous neuromuscular disorder characterized by skeletal myopathy and cardiomyopathy, inherited mostly in an autosomal dominant pattern. We report a five generation Uruguayan family with severe cardiomyopathy and skeletal myopathy. Its most striking features are: atrial dilation, arrhythmia, conduction block and sudden death due to conduction impairment. Affected skeletal muscle shows alteration of mitochondria with paracrystallin inclusions and granulofilamentous material scattered in the muscle fibres. This family carries an unusual deletion p.E114del within the 1A rod domain of desmin. Transfected cells expressing the mutated desmin show punctuated and speckled cytoplasmic aggregates. The mutation causes a local conformational change in heptads a/d residues and charge positions. These findings lead to the hypothesis that coiled-coil interactions may be impaired, resulting in severe alterations in the desmin network. This is the first time that a mutation affecting this domain in the desmin molecule is described in a desminopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Cdc48p/p97 is a highly conserved essential AAA protein that is required for many cellular processes, and is identified as a causative gene for an autosomal dominant human disorder, inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). Cdc48p/p97 is composed of an N-terminal domain, followed by two AAA domains (D1 and D2) whose ATPase activities have been characterized extensively. In this study, effects of mutations on the essential functions of yeast Cdc48p/p97 in vivo were systematically analyzed. IBMPFD-related mutations do not affect the essential functions of Cdc48p/p97. Loss of ATPase activity of D2 leads to loss of function of the protein in vivo. In contrast, ATPase activity of D1 per se is not essential, but a mutation locking D1 in an ATP-bound form is exceptionally lethal. Site-directed and random mutagenesis analyses suggest that the ATP-bound form of D1 changes an inter-domain interaction, thereby perturbing an essential function of Cdc48p/p97.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations of thymidine kinase 2 (TK2), an essential component of the mitochondrial nucleotide salvage pathway, can give rise to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndromes (MDS). These clinically heterogeneous disorders are characterized by severe reduction in mtDNA copy number in affected tissues and are associated with progressive myopathy, hepatopathy and/or encephalopathy, depending in part on the underlying nuclear genetic defect. Mutations of TK2 have previously been associated with an isolated myopathic form of MDS (OMIM 609560). However, more recently, neurological phenotypes have been demonstrated in patients carrying TK2 mutations, thus suggesting that loss of TK2 results in neuronal dysfunction. Here, we directly address the role of TK2 in neuronal homeostasis using a knockout mouse model. We demonstrate that in vivo loss of TK2 activity leads to a severe ataxic phenotype, accompanied by reduced mtDNA copy number and decreased steady-state levels of electron transport chain proteins in the brain. In TK2-deficient cerebellar neurons, these abnormalities are associated with impaired mitochondrial bioenergetic function, aberrant mitochondrial ultrastructure and degeneration of selected neuronal types. Overall, our findings demonstrate that TK2 deficiency leads to neuronal dysfunction in vivo, and have important implications for understanding the mechanisms of neurological impairment in MDS.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The broadwide spectrum of differential diagnoses of autosomal dominant muscular dystrophies in adults can be specified by additional features. The combination of late-onset muscular dystrophy, rimmed vacuoles and inclusion bodies in the muscle biopsy, and Paget's disease of bone suggests a mutation in the Valosin-containing protein gene (VCP, p97 or CDC48) even without dementia. We report on a German family with late-onset autosomal dominant muscular dystrophy starting in the pelvic girdle about age 40years, a subsequent rapidly-progressing course, high alkaline phosphatase and Paget's disease of bone. Clinical examination revealed no cognitive impairment. Histology showed myopathic changes with rimmed vacuoles and inclusion bodies on muscle biopsy. Mutations in VCP, filamin C, desmin, alphaB-crystallin, ZASP and myosin heavy chains 2 and 7 as well as the genes for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, Myotonic Dystrophy I and II, and LGMD1A-G were excluded by a combination of linkage analysis and direct sequencing. The family presented here suggests that a yet-unknown genetic defect can give rise to an autosomal dominant myopathy with Paget's disease but without dementia.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>VCP (VCP/p97) is a ubiquitously expressed member of the AAA(+)-ATPase family of chaperone-like proteins that regulates numerous cellular processes including chromatin decondensation, homotypic membrane fusion and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation by the proteasome. Mutations in VCP cause a multisystem degenerative disease consisting of inclusion body myopathy, Paget disease of bone, and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). Here we show that VCP is essential for autophagosome maturation. We generated cells stably expressing dual-tagged LC3 (mCherry-EGFP-LC3) which permit monitoring of autophagosome maturation. We determined that VCP deficiency by RNAi-mediated knockdown or overexpression of dominant-negative VCP results in significant accumulation of immature autophagic vesicles, some of which are abnormally large, acidified and exhibit cathepsin B activity. Furthermore, expression of disease-associated VCP mutants (R155H and A232E) also causes this autophagy defect. VCP was found to be essential to autophagosome maturation under basal conditions and in cells challenged by proteasome inhibition, but not in cells challenged by starvation, suggesting that VCP might be selectively required for autophagic degradation of ubiquitinated substrates. Indeed, a high percentage of the accumulated autophagic vesicles contain ubiquitin-positive contents, a feature that is not observed in autophagic vesicles that accumulate following starvation or treatment with Bafilomycin A. Finally, we show accumulation of numerous, large LAMP-1 and LAMP-2-positive vacuoles and accumulation of LC3-II in myoblasts derived from patients with IBMPFD. We conclude that VCP is essential for maturation of ubiquitin-containing autophagosomes and that defect in this function may contribute to IBMPFD pathogenesis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The recently described human anion channel Anoctamin (ANO) protein family comprises at least ten members, many of which have been shown to correspond to calcium-activated chloride channels. To date, the only reported human mutations in this family of genes are dominant mutations in ANO5 (TMEM16E, GDD1) in the rare skeletal disorder gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia. We have identified recessive mutations in ANO5 that result in a proximal limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2L) in three French Canadian families and in a distal non-dysferlin Miyoshi myopathy (MMD3) in Dutch and Finnish families. These mutations consist of a splice site, one base pair duplication shared by French Canadian and Dutch cases, and two missense mutations. The splice site and the duplication mutations introduce premature-termination codons and consequently trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, suggesting an underlining loss-of-function mechanism. The LGMD2L phenotype is characterized by proximal weakness, with prominent asymmetrical quadriceps femoris and biceps brachii atrophy. The MMD3 phenotype is associated with distal weakness, of calf muscles in particular. With the use of electron microscopy, multifocal sarcolemmal lesions were observed in both phenotypes. The phenotypic heterogeneity associated with ANO5 mutations is reminiscent of that observed with Dysferlin (DYSF) mutations that can cause both LGMD2B and Miyoshi myopathy (MMD1). In one MMD3-affected individual, defective membrane repair was documented on fibroblasts by membrane-resealing ability assays, as observed in dysferlinopathies. Though the function of the ANO5 protein is still unknown, its putative calcium-activated chloride channel function may lead to important insights into the role of deficient skeletal muscle membrane repair in muscular dystrophies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the dysferlin gene cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B, Miyoshi myopathy, and distal anterior compartment myopathy. Dysferlin mainly localizes to the sarcolemma in mature skeletal muscle where it is implicated in membrane fusion and repair. In different forms of muscular dystrophy, a predominantly cytoplasmic localization of dysferlin can be observed in regenerating myofibers, but the subcellular compartment responsible for this labeling pattern is not yet known. We have previously demonstrated an association of dysferlin with the developing T-tubule system in vitro. To investigate the role of dysferlin in adult skeletal muscle regeneration, we studied dysferlin localization at high resolution in a rat model of regeneration and found that the subcellular labeling of dysferlin colocalizes with the developing T-tubule system. Furthermore, ultrastructural analysis of dysferlin-deficient muscle revealed primary T-tubule anomalies similar to those seen in caveolin-3-deficient muscle. These findings indicate that dysferlin is necessary for correct T-tubule formation, and dysferlin-deficient skeletal muscle is characterized by abnormally configured T-tubules.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A new autoantibody against a 155-kDa protein has been described in patients with myositis. We conducted a study to determine the occurrence and types of cancer occurring in a cohort of patients with polymyositis (PM) or dermatomyositis (DM) and analyzed the value of this autoantibody as a serologic marker of cancer-associated myositis (CAM). Serum samples from all patients were examined by protein immunoprecipitation assays with HeLa cells to determine the presence of a 155-kDa protein band. HLA-DRB1 and DQA1 typing was performed by polymerase chain reaction-reverse sequence specific oligonucleotide. Statistical analyses were carried out with the Mann Whitney U and Fisher exact tests. Associations were determined using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Eighty-five patients with myositis (20 PM and 65 DM) were included. CAM was detected in 16 patients (19%), 14 with DM. The shawl sign rash was significantly more frequent in patients with CAM than in those without (p &lt; 0.01). Adenocarcinoma was the most frequent type of cancer (87.5%). Anti-p155 autoantibody was found in 1 of the 20 (5%) patients with PM and in 15 of the 65 (23%) patients with DM. A relationship between anti-p155 and CAM was found in DM patients (OR, 23; 95% CI, 5.23-101.2). The HLA-DQA1*0102 allele was not found in any of the anti-p155-positive patients. The prevalence of CAM in our cohort was 19%. Autoantibody against p155 was highly related to CAM and could be a reliable marker of cancer in patients with DM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Very-Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase deficiency (VLCADD) is an autosomal recessive disorder considered as one of the more common ss-oxidation defects, possibly associated with neonatal cardiomyopathy, infantile hepatic coma, or adult-onset myopathy. Numerous gene missense mutations have been described in these VLCADD phenotypes, but only few of them have been structurally and functionally analyzed, and the molecular basis of disease variability is still poorly understood. To address this question, we first analyzed fourteen disease-causing amino acid changes using the recently described crystal structure of VLCAD. The predicted effects varied from the replacement of amino acid residues lining the substrate binding cavity, involved in holoenzyme-FAD interactions or in enzyme dimerisation, predicted to have severe functional consequences, up to amino acid substitutions outside key enzyme domains or lying on near enzyme surface, with predicted milder consequences. These data were combined with functional analysis of residual fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and VLCAD protein levels in patient cells harboring these mutations, before and after pharmacological stimulation by bezafibrate. Mutations identified as detrimental to the protein structure in the 3-D model were generally associated to profound FAO and VLCAD protein deficiencies in the patient cells, however, some mutations affecting FAD binding or monomer-monomer interactions allowed a partial response to bezafibrate. On the other hand, bezafibrate restored near-normal FAO rates in some mutations predicted to have milder consequences on enzyme structure. Overall, combination of structural, biochemical, and pharmacological analysis allowed assessment of the relative severity of individual mutations, with possible applications for disease management and therapeutic approach.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Autosomal recessive hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM or IBM2) is a progressive adult onset muscle wasting disorder characterized by sparing of the quadriceps. IBM2 is also known as distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles or nonaka myopathy. IBM2 is associated with mutations in the UDP-GlcNAc 2-Epimerase/ManNAc Kinase gene (GNE). GNE is the rate-limiting enzyme of N-Acetylneuraminate (Neu5Ac, Sialic acid) biosynthesis. The GNE coding region of 64 symptomatic patients were sequenced. Twenty-eight patients were found to bear GNE mutations. Ten novel mutations were identified among nine patients, including four nonsense (p.R8X, p.W204X, p.Q436X, and p.S615X) and five missense (p.R71W, p.I142T, p.I298T, p.L556S, and p.E2G) variations spanning both the epimerase and kinase domains of GNE. Additionally, a synonymous variation (p.Y591Y, codon tac > tat) was seen in a patient bearing compound heterozygous nonsynonymous mutations (p.S615X and p.Y675H). Six of the nine are Caucasian, one patient is Taiwanese, one patient is Asian Indian, and one patient is of European descent. These findings further expand the clinical and genetic spectrum of IBM2.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a genetically and clinically heterogenous muscle disorder, which is myopathologically characterized by nemaline bodies. Mutations in six genes have been reported to cause NM: Nebulin (NEB Pelin 1999), alpha-skeletal muscle actin (ACTA1 Nowak 1999), alpha-slow tropomyosin (TPM3 Laing 1995), beta-tropomyosin (TPM2 Donner 2002), slow troponin T (TNNT1 Johnston 2000) and cofilin 2 (CFL2 Agrawal 2007). The majority of cases are due to mutation in NEB and ACTA1. We report on the clinical, myopathological and muscle MRI findings in a German family with autosomal dominant NM due to a novel pathogenic TPM3 mutation (p.Ala156Thr).</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in valosin-containing protein (VCP) cause inclusion body myopathy (IBM), Paget's disease of the bone, and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). Patient muscle has degenerating fibers, rimmed vacuoles (RVs), and sarcoplasmic inclusions containing ubiquitin and TDP-43 (TARDNA-binding protein 43). In this study, we find that IBMPFD muscle also accumulates autophagosome-associated proteins, Map1-LC3 (LC3), and p62/sequestosome, which localize to RVs. To test whether VCP participates in autophagy, we silenced VCP or expressed adenosine triphosphatase-inactive VCP. Under basal conditions, loss of VCP activity results in autophagosome accumulation. After autophagic induction, these autophagosomes fail to mature into autolysosomes and degrade LC3. Similarly, IBMPFD mutant VCP expression in cells and animals leads to the accumulation of nondegradative autophagosomes that coalesce at RVs and fail to degrade aggregated proteins. Interestingly, TDP-43 accumulates in the cytosol upon autophagic inhibition, similar to that seen after IBMPFD mutant expression. These data implicate VCP in autophagy and suggest that impaired autophagy explains the pathology seen in IBMPFD muscle, including TDP-43 accumulation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of cell growth that associates with raptor and rictor to form the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2, respectively. Raptor is required for oxidative muscle integrity, whereas rictor is dispensable. In this study, we show that muscle-specific inactivation of mTOR leads to severe myopathy, resulting in premature death. mTOR-deficient muscles display metabolic changes similar to those observed in muscles lacking raptor, including impaired oxidative metabolism, altered mitochondrial regulation, and glycogen accumulation associated with protein kinase B/Akt hyperactivation. In addition, mTOR-deficient muscles exhibit increased basal glucose uptake, whereas whole body glucose homeostasis is essentially maintained. Importantly, loss of mTOR exacerbates the myopathic features in both slow oxidative and fast glycolytic muscles. Moreover, mTOR but not raptor and rictor deficiency leads to reduced muscle dystrophin content. We provide evidence that mTOR controls dystrophin transcription in a cell-autonomous, rapamycin-resistant, and kinase-independent manner. Collectively, our results demonstrate that mTOR acts mainly via mTORC1, whereas regulation of dystrophin is raptor and rictor independent.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Defects in the development or activation of T cells result in immunodeficiency associated with severe infections early in life. T-cell activation requires Ca2+ influx through Ca2+-release activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels encoded by the gene ORAI1. OBJECTIVE: Investigation of the genetic causes and the clinical phenotype of immunodeficiency in patients with impaired Ca2+ influx and CRAC channel function. METHODS: DNA sequence analysis for mutations in the genes ORAI1, ORAI2, ORAI3, and stromal interaction molecule (STIM) 1 and 2, as well as mRNA and protein expression analysis of ORAI1 in immunodeficient patients. Immunohistochemical analysis of ORAI1 tissue distribution in healthy human donors. RESULTS: We identified mutations in ORAI1 in patients from 2 unrelated families. One patient is homozygous for a frameshift nonsense mutation in ORAI1 (ORAI1-A88SfsX25), and a second patient is compound heterozygous for 2 missense mutations in ORAI1 (ORAI1-A103E/L194P). All 3 mutations abolish ORAI1 expression and impair Ca2+ influx and CRAC channel function. The clinical syndrome associated with ORAI1 deficiency is characterized by immunodeficiency with a defect in the function but not in the development of lymphocytes, congenital myopathy, and anhydrotic ectodermal dysplasia with a defect in dental enamel calcification. In contrast with the limited clinical phenotype, we found ORAI1 protein expression in a wide variety of cell types and organs. CONCLUSION: Ca2+ influx through ORAI1 is crucial for lymphocyte function in vivo. Despite almost ubiquitous ORAI1 expression, the channel has a nonredundant role in only a few cell types judging from the limited clinical phenotype in ORAI1-deficient patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mammalian ferrochelatase, the terminal enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, possesses an iron-sulfur [2Fe-2S] cluster that does not participate in catalysis. We investigated ferrochelatase expression in iron-deficient erythropoietic tissues of mice lacking iron regulatory protein 2, in iron-deficient murine erythroleukemia cells, and in human patients with ISCU myopathy. Ferrochelatase activity and protein levels were dramatically decreased in Irp2(-/-) spleens, whereas ferrochelatase mRNA levels were increased, demonstrating posttranscriptional regulation of ferrochelatase in vivo. Translation of ferrochelatase mRNA was unchanged in iron-depleted murine erythroleukemia cells, and the stability of mature ferrochelatase protein was also unaffected. However, the stability of newly formed ferrochelatase protein was dramatically decreased during iron deficiency. Ferrochelatase was also severely depleted in muscle biopsies and cultured myoblasts from patients with ISCU myopathy, a disease caused by deficiency of a scaffold protein required for Fe-S cluster assembly. Together, these data suggest that decreased Fe-S cluster availability because of cellular iron depletion or impaired Fe-S cluster assembly causes reduced maturation and stabilization of apo-ferrochelatase, providing a direct link between Fe-S biogenesis and completion of heme biosynthesis. We propose that decreased heme biosynthesis resulting from impaired Fe-S cluster assembly can contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases caused by defective Fe-S cluster biogenesis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The biogenesis of mitochondria requires the import of a large number of proteins from the cytosol [1, 2]. Although numerous studies have defined the proteinaceous machineries that mediate mitochondrial protein sorting, little is known about the role of lipids in mitochondrial protein import. Cardiolipin, the signature phospholipid of the mitochondrial inner membrane [3-5], affects the stability of many inner-membrane protein complexes [6-12]. Perturbation of cardiolipin metabolism leads to the X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy Barth syndrome [13-18]. We report that cardiolipin affects the preprotein translocases of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Cardiolipin mutants genetically interact with mutants of outer-membrane translocases. Mitochondria from cardiolipin yeast mutants, as well as Barth syndrome patients, are impaired in the biogenesis of outer-membrane proteins. Our findings reveal a new role for cardiolipin in protein sorting at the mitochondrial outer membrane and bear implications for the pathogenesis of Barth syndrome.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Ryr1(I4895T/wt) (IT/+) mice express a knockin mutation corresponding to the human I4898T EC-uncoupling mutation in the type 1 ryanodine receptor/Ca(2+) release channel (RyR1), which causes a severe form of central core disease (CCD). IT/+ mice exhibit a slowly progressive congenital myopathy, with neonatal respiratory stress, skeletal muscle weakness, impaired mobility, dorsal kyphosis, and hind limb paralysis. Lesions observed in myofibers from diseased mice undergo age-dependent transformation from minicores to cores and nemaline rods. Early ultrastructural abnormalities include sarcomeric misalignment, Z-line streaming, focal loss of cross-striations, and myofibrillar splitting and intermingling that may arise from defective myofibrillogenesis. However, manifestation of the disease phenotype is highly variable on a Sv129 genomic background. Quantitative RT-PCR shows an equimolar ratio of WT and mutant Ryr1 transcripts within IT/+ myofibers and total RyR1 protein expression levels are normal. We propose a unifying theory in which the cause of core formation lies in functional heterogeneity among RyR1 tetramers. Random combinations of normal and either leaky or EC-uncoupled RyR subunits would lead to spatial differences in Ca(2+) transients; the resulting heterogeneity of contraction among myofibrils would lead to focal, irreversible tearing and shearing, which would, over time, enlarge to form minicores, cores, and nemaline rods. The IT/+ mouse line is proposed to be a valid model of RyR1-related congenital myopathy, offering high potential for elucidation of the pathogenesis of skeletal muscle disorders arising from impaired EC coupling.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of PDCDS, Caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Bax in skeletal muscle of patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathies with lactate acidosis and stroke like episodes (MELAS), limb-girdle type mitochondrial myopathy (LGMM) and chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), and to explore the correlation between apoptosis and the pathogenesis of mitochondrial cytopathy. METHODS: Three patients with MELAS, 2 patients with LGMM and 6 patients with CPEO were enrolled, including eight males and three females, the diagnosis of MELAS, LGMM or CPEO was made on the basis of clinical manifestations, muscle biopsy specimen findings and a point mutation or a large-scale mitochondrial DNA deletion. Controls consisted of 11 muscle biopsy samples from subjects with no diagnostic findings (age and gender matched with patients'). Muscle biopsy was performed after obtaining the informed consent. The specimens were quickly frozen and transverse sections stained for hematoxylineosin, periodic acid Schiff reaction, oil red "0", modified Gomori trichrome, ATPase, NADH-TR, succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase, and nonspecific esterase. The expression of PDCD5, Caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Bax were detected by immunohistochemistry. The authors used the tissue slices of prostate or tonsil containing the target protein as positive control and PBS in place of these primary antibodies as negative control. RESULTS: PDCDS was highly expressed in some ragged red fibers in 2 patients with LGMM and 3 patients with CPEO. And it was also expressed in some capillary of patients with MELAS and LGMM. Caspase-3 was expressed in a few ragged red fibers in 1 patients with MELAS, 2 patients with LGMM and 1 patient with CPEO. And there was also expression in some capillary of both MELAS and LGMM. Bcl-2 staining showed a high expression in sarcoplasm of some ragged red fibers and atrophic fibers in 4 patients with MELAS, 2 patients with LGMM and 5 patients with CPEO, at the same time, it was weakly expressed in sarcoplasm of all type 2 muscle fibers and some small vessels of both patients and controls. There was no Bax immunoreactive fiber or vessel in MELAS, LGMM and CPEO patients. All of the above-mentioned proteins except Bcl-2 were negative in muscle fibers and vessels of controls. CONCLUSION: Abnormal regulation of apoptosis is involved in the pathophysiology of mitochondrial cytopathy. And PDCDS, Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 take part in regulation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD) is a rare congenital myopathy characterized by hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness. Pathologic diagnosis of CFTD is based on the presence of type 1 fiber hypotrophy of at least 12% in the absence of other notable pathological findings. Mutations of the ACTA1 and SEPN1 genes have been identified in a small percentage of CFTD cases. The muscle tropomyosin 3 gene, TPM3, is mutated in rare cases of nemaline myopathy that typically exhibit type 1 fiber hypotrophy with nemaline rods, and recently mutations in the TPM3 gene were also found to cause CFTD. We screened the TPM3 gene in patients with a clinical diagnosis of CFTD, nemaline myopathy, and with undefined congenital myopathies. Mutations in TPM3 were identified in 6 out of 13 patients with CFTD, as well as in one case of nemaline myopathy. Review of muscle biopsies from patients with diagnoses of CFTD revealed that patients with a TPM3 mutation all displayed marked disproportion of fiber size, without type 1 fiber predominance. Several mutation-negative cases exhibited other abnormalities, such as central nuclei and central cores. These results support the utility of the CFTD diagnosis in directing the course of genetic testing.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Heart failure (HF) is associated with changes in the skeletal muscle (SM) which might be a consequence of the unbalanced local expression of pro-(TNF-alpha) and anti-(IL-10) inflammatory cytokines, leading to inflammation-induced myopathy, and SM wasting. This local effect of HF on SM may, on the other hand, contribute to systemic inflammation, as this tissue actively secretes cytokines. Since increasing evidence points out to an anti-inflammatory effect of exercise training, the goal of the present study was to investigate its effect in rats with HF after post-myocardial infarction (MI), with special regard to the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-10 in the soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL), muscles with different fiber composition. Wistar rats underwent left thoracotomy with ligation of the left coronary artery, and were randomly assigned to either a sedentary (Sham-operated and MI sedentary) or trained (Sham-operated and MI trained) group. Animals in the trained groups ran on a treadmill (0% grade at 13-20 m/min) for 60 min/day, 5 days/week, for 8-10 weeks. The training protocol was able to reverse the changes induced by MI, decreasing TNF-alpha protein (26%, P&lt;0.05) and mRNA (58%, P&lt;0.05) levels in the soleus, when compared with the sedentary MI group. Training also increased soleus IL-10 expression (2.6-fold, P&lt;0.001) in post-MI HF rats. As a consequence, the IL-10/TNF-alpha ratio was increased. This "anti-inflammatory effect" was more pronounced in the soleus than in the EDL, suggesting a fiber composition dependent response.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathy (NM), the most common non-dystrophic congenital myopathy, is clinically characterized by muscle weakness. However, the mechanisms underlying this weakness are poorly understood. Here, we studied the contractile phenotype of skeletal muscle from NM patients with nebulin mutations (NEM2). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting studies revealed markedly reduced nebulin protein levels in muscle from NM patients, whereas levels of other thin filament-based proteins were not significantly altered. Muscle mechanics studies indicated significantly reduced calcium sensitivity of force generation in NM muscle fibers compared to control fibers. In addition, we found slower rate constant of force redevelopment, as well as increased tension cost, in NM compared to control fibers, indicating that in NM muscle the rate of cross-bridge attachment is reduced, whereas the rate of cross-bridge detachment is increased. The resulting reduced fraction of force generating cross-bridges is expected to greatly impair the force generating capacity of muscle from NM patients. Thus, the present study provides important novel insights into the pathogenesis of muscle weakness in nebulin-based NM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>RATIONALE: The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, are important drugs used in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease. Although statins are well tolerated, many patients develop myopathy manifesting as muscle aches and pain. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but severe toxicity of statins. Interindividual differences in the activities of hepatic membrane drug transporters and metabolic enzymes are known to influence statin plasma pharmacokinetics and risk for myopathy. Interestingly, little is known regarding the molecular determinants of statin distribution into skeletal muscle and its relevance to toxicity. OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify statin transporters in human skeletal muscle and determine their impact on statin toxicity in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS: We demonstrate that the uptake transporter OATP2B1 (human organic anion transporting polypeptide 2B1) and the efflux transporters, multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)1, MRP4, and MRP5 are expressed on the sarcolemmal membrane of human skeletal muscle fibers and that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are substrates of these transporters when assessed using a heterologous expression system. In an in vitro model of differentiated, primary human skeletal muscle myoblast cells, we demonstrate basal membrane expression and drug efflux activity of MRP1, which contributes to reducing intracellular statin accumulation. Furthermore, we show that expression of human OATP2B1 in human skeletal muscle myoblast cells by adenoviral vectors increases intracellular accumulation and toxicity of statins and such effects were abrogated when cells overexpressed MRP1. CONCLUSIONS: These results identify key membrane transporters as modulators of skeletal muscle statin exposure and toxicity.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dynamin 2 (DNM2)-related dominant centronuclear myopathy is usually a mild disorder, but more severe variants have been associated with mutations affecting the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of the protein, mainly implicated in different forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease (CMT). Whilst DNM2-related CMT may feature non-neurological findings including cataracts, this has not been reported in DNM2-related centronuclear myopathy. We report a girl presenting from birth with hypotonia, respiratory and feeding difficulties. Motor development was delayed and at 9years she lost the ability to walk. She had ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia and bilateral cataracts. Muscle biopsy showed increase in central nuclei with type 1 hypotrophy and fibrosis. DNM2 screening revealed a novel heterozygous substitution (c.1862T>C; p.Leu621Pro) affecting the PH domain of the protein. Her further course was progressive and at 14years she died from respiratory failure. Our findings expand the phenotypical spectrum associated with DNM2 mutations and provide a new clinical indicator for involvement of this gene in patients with centronuclear myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report a family with autosomal dominant centronuclear (myotubular) myopathy caused by a novel mutation, p.A618D, in dynamin 2 (DNM2). The 64-year-old mother and 26-year-old daughter had neonatal onset with hypotonia and weak suckling, followed by improvement, then slowly progressive muscle weakness and respiratory restriction. Muscle biopsy showed radial sarcoplasmic strands around the frequent central nuclei. Electrophysiology revealed predominantly myopathic patterns without peripheral nerve involvement. Centronuclear myopathy with neonatal onset caused by a DNM2 mutation in the C-terminal part of the pleckstrin homology domain may have a favorable prognosis and follow a course similar to adult-onset centronuclear myopathy. We advise respiratory follow-up in these patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a classically unapparent pharmacogenetic disorder of the skeletal muscles triggered by inhalational anesthetics or depolarizing muscle relaxants. The disposition to MH is inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner and is primarily due to mutations in the gene for the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RyR1). The present study intended to analyze whether mild muscular symptoms (elevation of the resting CK, cramps in the calves, slight calf hypertrophy) may be associated with susceptibility to MH and/or with histopathological changes. METHODS: A muscle biopsy was taken from 12 out of 44 blood relatives (three generations) of a large family and was investigated with the halothane/caffeine in vitro contracture test (IVCT). Afterwards a histological, histochemical and immunhistological examination was performed. Altogether in 29 persons the DNA was analyzed for mutations in the RyR1-gene. RESULTS: Eight persons were diagnosed as susceptible to MH (MHS) by the IVCT, 4 were MH negative. All MHS persons carried the MH causative c.6617C > T (Thr2206Met) mutation and showed slight clinical signs of a myopathy as well as mild biopsy changes with isolated hypotrophic fibers and disseminated small areas with reduction of oxidative staining (multi-minicore like lesions). The Thr2206Met mutation was identified in another further 9 relatives who also experienced mild myopathological features. Clinical MH incidents were not reported in this large family. CONCLUSION: The RyR1 Thr2206Met mutation is one of the most frequent mutations in the European MH population but carriers are normally healthy. In this study we could demonstrate that the MH causative Thr2206Met mutation may also be associated both with clinical symptoms of a mild myopathy and histopathological changes in the oxidative inter myofibrillar network.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The bifunctional enzyme UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ ManNAc kinase (GNE/MNK), encoded by the GNE gene, catalyzes the first two committed, rate-limiting steps in the biosynthesis of N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid). GNE/MNK is feedback inhibited by binding of the downstream product, CMP-sialic acid in its allosteric site. GNE mutations can result in two human disorders, hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) or sialuria. So far, no active site geometry predictions or conformational transitions involved with function are available for mammalian GNE/MNK. The N-terminal GNE domain is homologous to various prokaryotic 2-epimerases, some of which have solved crystallographic structures. The C-terminal MNK domain belongs to the sugar kinases superfamily; its crystallographic structure is solved at 2.84 A and three-dimensional structures have also been reported for several other kinases. In this work, we employed available structural data of GNE/MNK homologs to model the active sites of human GNE/MNK and identify critical amino acid residues responsible for interactions with substrates. In addition, we modeled effects of GNE/MNK missense mutations associated with HIBM or sialuria on helix arrangement, substrate binding, and enzyme action. We found that all reported mutations are associated with the active sites or secondary structure interfaces of GNE/MNK. The Persian-Jewish HIBM founder mutation p.M712T is located at the interface alpha4alpha10 and likely affects GlcNAc, Mg2+, and ATP binding. This work contributes to further understanding of GNE/MNK function and ligand binding, which may assist future studies for therapeutic options that target misfolded GNE/MNK in HIBM and/or sialuria.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD) or Udd myopathy is an autosomal dominant distal myopathy with late onset, at first described in the Finnish population. We report here the first Italian cases of TTN mutated titinopathy. The proband, a 60 year-old female, had the first muscular signs at the age of 59 years, with difficulty in walking and right foot drop. Muscle imaging showed selective fatty degenerative change in the anterior compartment of leg muscles. Her 67 year-old brother, started to show muscle weakness, pain at lower limbs and hypertrophy of calf muscles at the age of 66 years. Their mother began to show foot drop and impaired walking from the age of 60 years. Other relatives are reported to be affected in a similar way. Because the phenotype appeared compatible with TMD, we analyzed the TTN gene in the DNA of the proband and we identified a heterozygous mutation 293326A>C. This mutation is also present in the brother and in the other affected individuals of the same family. The mutation predicts a His33378Pro change located next to the previously known Belgian TMD mutation. The mutation was not found in 100 Italian control DNA samples. Then, since the introduction of a proline in the last domain of titin was previously known to cause TMD in French families, we can conclude that this missense mutation is the obvious pathogenetic mutation in the affected patients. No other disease causing mutations in the TTN gene have so far been reported in the Italian population.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Desmin-related myopathy is a clinically heterogenous group of disorders encompassing myopathies, cardiomyopathies, conduction disease, and combinations of these disorders. Mutations in the gene encoding desmin (DES), a major intermediate filament protein, can underlie this phenotype. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical and pathologic characteristics of 27 patients from five families with an identical mutation in the head domain region (p.S13F) of desmin. METHODS/RESULTS: All 27 carriers or obligate carriers of a p.S13F DES founder mutation demonstrated a fully penetrant yet variable phenotype. All patients demonstrated cardiac involvement characterized by high-grade AV block at young ages and important right ventricular (RV) involvement. RV predominance was demonstrated by the presence of right bundle branch block in 10 patients (sometimes as a first manifestation) and by RV heart failure in 6 patients, including 2 patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy. Because of this clinical overlap with desmosome cardiomyopathies, we also studied the organization of the intercalated disks, particularly the distribution of desmosomal proteins. Normal amounts of the major desmosomal proteins were found, but the intercalated disks were more convoluted and elongated and had a zigzag appearance. CONCLUSION: In this largest series to date of individuals with a single head domain DES mutation, patients show a variable yet predominantly cardiologic phenotype characterized by conduction disease at an early age and RV involvement including right bundle branch block and/or RV tachycardias and arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy phenocopies. A localized effect of desmin on the structure of the cardiac intercalated disks might contribute to disease pathogenesis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Integrin-mediated adhesion to the ECM is essential for normal development of animal tissues. During muscle development, integrins provide the structural stability required to construct such a highly tensile, force generating tissue. Mutations that disrupt integrin-mediated adhesion in skeletal muscles give rise to a myopathy in humans and mice. To determine if this is due to defects in formation or defects in maintenance of muscle tissue, we used an inducible, targeted RNAi based approach to disrupt integrin-mediated adhesion in fully formed adult fly muscles. A decrease in integrin-mediated adhesion in adult muscles led to a progressive loss of muscle function due to a failure to maintain normal sarcomeric cytoarchitecture. This defect was due to a gradual, age dependent disorganization of the sarcomeric actin, Z-line, and M-line. Electron microscopic analysis showed that reduction in integrin-mediated adhesion resulted in detachment of actin filaments from the Z-lines, separation of the Z-lines from the membrane, and eventually to disintegration of the Z-lines. Our results show that integrin-mediated adhesion is essential for maintaining sarcomeric integrity and illustrate that the seemingly stable adhesive contacts underlying sarcomeric architecture are inherently dynamic.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2B, Miyoshi myopathy, and distal myopathy of anterior tibialis are severely debilitating muscular dystrophies caused by genetically determined dysferlin deficiency. In these muscular dystrophies, it is the repair, not the structure, of the plasma membrane that is impaired. Though much is known about the effects of dysferlin deficiency in skeletal muscle, little is known about the role of dysferlin in maintenance of cardiomyocytes. Recent evidence suggests that dysferlin deficiency affects cardiac muscle, leading to cardiomyopathy when stressed. However, neither the morphological location of dysferlin in the cardiomyocyte nor the progression of the disease with age are known. In this study, we examined a mouse model of dysferlinopathy using light and electron microscopy as well as echocardiography and conscious electrocardiography. We determined that dysferlin is normally localized to the intercalated disk and sarcoplasm of the cardiomyocytes. In the absence of dysferlin, cardiomyocyte membrane damage occurs and is localized to the intercalated disk and sarcoplasm. This damage results in transient functional deficits at 10 months of age, but, unlike in skeletal muscle, the cell injury is sublethal and causes only mild cardiomyopathy even at advanced ages.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>To date, more than 230 disease-causing mutations have been linked to the slow/cardiac muscle myosin gene, beta-MyHC (MYH7). Most of these mutations are located in the globular head region of the protein and result in cardiomyopathies. Recently, however, a number of novel disease-causing mutations have been described in the long, alpha-helical, coiled coil tail region of the beta-MyHC protein. Mutations in this region are of particular interest because they are associated with a multitude of human diseases, including both cardiac and skeletal myopathies. Here, we attempt to dissect the mechanism(s) by which mutations in the rod region of beta-MyHC can cause a variety of diseases by analyzing two mutations at a single amino acid (R1500P and R1500W) which cause two distinct diseases (Laing-type early-onset distal myopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy, respectively). For diseases linked to the R1500 residue, we find that each mutation displays distinct structural, thermodynamic, and functional properties. Both R1500P and R1500W cause a decrease in thermodynamic stability, although the R1500W phenotype is more severe. Both mutations also affect filament assembly, with R1500P causing an additional decrease in filament stability. In addition to furthering our understanding of the mechanism of pathogenesis for each of these diseases, these data also suggest how the variance in molecular phenotype may be associated with the variance in clinical phenotype present with mutations in the beta-MyHC rod.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Skeletal muscle contraction is triggered by the excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling machinery residing at the triad, a membrane structure formed by the juxtaposition of T-tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) cisternae. The formation and maintenance of this structure is key for muscle function but is not well characterized. We have investigated the mechanisms leading to X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a severe congenital disorder due to loss of function mutations in the MTM1 gene, encoding myotubularin, a phosphoinositide phosphatase thought to have a role in plasma membrane homeostasis and endocytosis. Using a mouse model of the disease, we report that Mtm1-deficient muscle fibers have a decreased number of triads and abnormal longitudinally oriented T-tubules. In addition, SR Ca(2+) release elicited by voltage-clamp depolarizations is strongly depressed in myotubularin-deficient muscle fibers, with myoplasmic Ca(2+) removal and SR Ca(2+) content essentially unaffected. At the molecular level, Mtm1-deficient myofibers exhibit a 3-fold reduction in type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1) protein level. These data reveal a critical role of myotubularin in the proper organization and function of the E-C coupling machinery and strongly suggest that defective RyR1-mediated SR Ca(2+) release is responsible for the failure of muscle function in myotubular myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Skeletal muscle contraction is reputed not to depend on extracellular Ca2+. Indeed, stricto sensu, excitation-contraction coupling does not necessitate entry of Ca2+. However, we previously observed that, during sustained activity (repeated contractions), entry of Ca2+ is needed to maintain force production. In the present study, we evaluated the possible involvement of the canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC)1 ion channel in this entry of Ca2+ and investigated its possible role in muscle function. Patch-clamp experiments reveal the presence of a small-conductance channel (13 pS) that is completely lost in adult fibers from TRPC1(-/-) mice. The influx of Ca2+ through TRPC1 channels represents a minor part of the entry of Ca(2+) into muscle fibers at rest, and the activity of the channel is not store dependent. The lack of TRPC1 does not affect intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) transients reached during a single isometric contraction. However, the involvement of TRPC1-related Ca2+ entry is clearly emphasized in muscle fatigue. Indeed, muscles from TRPC1(-/-) mice stimulated repeatedly progressively display lower [Ca2+](i) transients than those observed in TRPC1(+/+) fibers, and they also present an accentuated progressive loss of force. Interestingly, muscles from TRPC1(-/-) mice display a smaller fiber cross-sectional area, generate less force per cross-sectional area, and contain less myofibrillar proteins than their controls. They do not present other signs of myopathy. In agreement with in vitro experiments, TRPC1(-/-) mice present an important decrease of endurance of physical activity. We conclude that TRPC1 ion channels modulate the entry of Ca(2+) during repeated contractions and help muscles to maintain their force during sustained repeated contractions.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) is a key molecule in the pathogenesis of distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV) and hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) and almost all such patients have some mutations in GNE. However, subcellular localization of GNE and the mechanism of muscular damage have not been clarified. METHODS: A rabbit polyclonal antibody for GNE was prepared. Immunohistochemistry was performed using anti-GNE and anti-nuclear protein antibodies. Western blotting with subcellular fractionated proteins was performed to determine subcellular localization of GNE. The sizes of myonuclei were quantified in muscle biopsies from patients with DMRV and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). RESULTS: In DMRV muscles, immunohistochemistry identified GNE in sarcoplasm and specifically in myonuclei and rimmed vacuoles (RV). Nuclear proteins were also found in RVs. Immunohistochemistry showed colocalization of GNE and emerin in C2C12 cells. Western blotting revealed the presence of GNE in nuclear fractions of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells. The mean size of myonuclei of DMRV was significantly larger than that of ALS. CONCLUSION: GNE is present in myonuclei near nuclear membrane. Our results suggest that myonuclei are involved in RV formation in DMRV, and that mutant GNE in myonuclei seems to play some role in this process.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Triadin is a multiple proteins family, some isoforms being involved in muscle excitation-contraction coupling, and some having still unknown functions. To obtain clues on triadin functions, we engineered a triadin knock-out mouse line and characterized the physiological effect of triadin ablation on skeletal muscle function. These mice presented a reduced muscle strength, which seemed not to alter their survival and has been characterized in the present work. We first checked in these mice the expression level of the different proteins involved in calcium homeostasis and observed in fast muscles an increase in expression of dihydropyridine receptor, with a large reduction in calsequestrin expression. Electron microscopy analysis of KO muscles morphology demonstrated the presence of triads in abnormal orientation and a reduction in the sarcoplasmic reticulum terminal cisternae volume. Using calcium imaging on cultured myotubes, we observed a reduction in the total amount of calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Physiological studies have been performed to evaluate the influence of triadin deletion on skeletal muscle function. Muscle strength has been measured both on the whole animal model, using hang test or electrical stimulation combined with NMR analysis and strength measurement, or on isolated muscle using electrical stimulation. All the results obtained demonstrate an important reduction in muscle strength, indicating that triadin plays an essential role in skeletal muscle function and in skeletal muscle structure. These results indicate that triadin alteration leads to the development of a myopathy, which could be studied using this new animal model.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc 6-kinase, GNE, is a bi-functional enzyme that plays a key role in sialic acid biosynthesis. Mutations of the GNE protein cause sialurea or autosomal recessive inclusion body myopathy/Nonaka myopathy. GNE is the only human protein that contains a kinase domain belonging to the ROK (repressor, ORF, kinase) family. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We solved the structure of the GNE kinase domain in the ligand-free state. The protein exists predominantly as a dimer in solution, with small populations of monomer and higher-order oligomer in equilibrium with the dimer. Crystal packing analysis reveals the existence of a crystallographic hexamer, and that the kinase domain dimerizes through the C-lobe subdomain. Mapping of disease-related missense mutations onto the kinase domain structure revealed that the mutation sites could be classified into four different groups based on the location - dimer interface, interlobar helices, protein surface, or within other secondary structural elements. CONCLUSIONS: The crystal structure of the kinase domain of GNE provides a structural basis for understanding disease-causing mutations and a model of hexameric wild type full length enzyme.

<rdfs:comment>Duchenne myopathy is a lethal disease due to the absence of dystrophin, a cytoskeletal protein. Muscles from dystrophin-deficient mice (mdx) typically present an exaggerated susceptibility to eccentric work characterized by an important force drop and an increased membrane permeability consecutive to repeated lengthening contractions. The present study shows that mdx muscles are largely protected from eccentric work-induced damage by overexpressing a dominant negative mutant of TRPV2 ion channel. This observation points out the role of TRPV2 channel in the physiopathology of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the gene DYSF, which codes for the protein dysferlin, underlie Miyoshi myopathy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2B in humans and produce a slowly progressing skeletal muscle degenerative disease in mice. Dysferlin is a Ca(2+)-sensing, regulatory protein that is involved in membrane repair after injury. To assess the function of dysferlin in healthy and dystrophic skeletal muscle, we generated skeletal muscle-specific transgenic mice with threefold overexpression of this protein. These mice were phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type, and more importantly, the transgene completely rescued the muscular dystrophy (MD) disease in Dysf-null A/J mice. The dysferlin transgene rescued all histopathology and macrophage infiltration in skeletal muscle of Dysf(-/-) A/J mice, as well as promoted the rapid recovery of muscle function after forced lengthening contractions. These results indicate that MD in A/J mice is autonomous to skeletal muscle and not initiated by any other cell type. However, overexpression of dysferlin did not improve dystrophic symptoms or membrane instability in the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex-lacking Scgd (delta-sarcoglycan) null mouse, indicating that dysferlin functionality is not a limiting factor underlying membrane repair in other models of MD. In summary, the restoration of dysferlin in skeletal muscle fibers is sufficient to rescue the MD in Dysf-deficient mice, although its mild overexpression does not appear to functionally enhance membrane repair in other models of MD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with mild statin-induced side effects. BACKGROUND: Statin-induced side effects can interfere with therapy. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 enzymes impair statin metabolism; the reduced function SLCO1B1*5 allele impairs statin clearance and is associated with simvastatin-induced myopathy with creatine kinase (CK) elevation. METHODS: The STRENGTH (Statin Response Examined by Genetic Haplotype Markers) study was a pharmacogenetics study of statin efficacy and safety. Subjects (n = 509) were randomized to atorvastatin 10 mg, simvastatin 20 mg, or pravastatin 10 mg followed by 80 mg, 80 mg, and 40 mg, respectively. We defined a composite adverse event (CAE) as discontinuation for any side effect, myalgia, or CK >3x upper limit of normal during follow-up. We sequenced CYP2D6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and SLCO1B1 and tested 7 reduced function alleles for association with the CAE. RESULTS: The CAE occurred in 99 subjects (54 discontinuations, 49 myalgias, and 9 CK elevations). Sex was associated with CAE (percent female in CAE vs. no CAE groups, 66% vs. 50%, p &lt; 0.01). SLCO1B1*5 was associated with CAE (percent with > or = 1 allele in CAE vs. no CAE groups, 37% vs. 25%, p = 0.03) and those with CAE with no significant CK elevation (p &lt; or = 0.03). Furthermore, there was evidence for a gene-dose effect (percent with CAE in those with 0, 1, or 2 alleles: 19%, 27%, and 50%, trend p = 0.01). Finally, the CAE risk appeared to be greatest in those carriers assigned to simvastatin. CONCLUSIONS: SLCO1B1*5 genotype and female sex were associated mild statin-induced side effects. These findings expand the results of a recent genome-wide association study of statin myopathy with CK >3x normal to milder, statin-induced, muscle side effects.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is caused by mutations in the valosin containing protein (VCP) gene. The disease is associated with progressive proximal muscle weakness, inclusions and vacuoles in muscle fibers, malfunction in the bone remodeling process resulting in Paget's disease, and premature frontotemporal dementia. VCP is involved in several cellular processes related to the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation of proteins. To understand the pathological mechanisms underlying the myopathy in IBMPFD, we have studied the cellular consequences of VCP mutations in human primary myoblasts. Our results revealed that patients' myoblasts accumulate large vacuoles. Lysosomal membrane proteins Lamp1 and Lamp2 show increased molecular weights in patients' myoblasts due to differential N-glycosylation. Additionally, mutant myoblasts show increased autophagy when cultured in the absence of nutrients, as well as defective cell fusion and increased apoptosis. Our results elucidate that VCP mutations result in disturbances in several cellular processes, which will help us in the understanding of the pathological mechanisms resulting in muscle weakness and other features of VCP associated disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED) are relatively common skeletal dysplasias belonging to the same bone dysplasia family. PSACH is characterized by generalized epi-metaphyseal dysplasia, short-limbed dwarfism, joint laxity and early onset osteoarthritis. MED is a milder disease with radiographic features often restricted to the epiphyses of the long bones. PSACH and some forms of MED result from mutations in cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), a pentameric glycoprotein found in cartilage, tendon, ligament and muscle. PSACH-MED patients often have a mild myopathy characterized by mildly increased plasma creatine kinase levels, a variation in myofibre size and/or small atrophic fibres. In some instances, patients are referred to neuromuscular clinics prior to the diagnosis of an underlying skeletal dysplasia; however, the myopathy associated with PSACH-MED has not previously been studied. In this study, we present a detailed study of skeletal muscle, tendon and ligament from a mouse model of mild PSACH harbouring a COMP mutation. Mutant mice exhibited a progressive muscle weakness associated with an increased number of muscle fibres with central nuclei at the perimysium and at the myotendinous junction. Furthermore, the distribution of collagen fibril diameters in the mutant tendons and ligaments was altered towards thicker collagen fibrils, and the tendons became more lax in cyclic strain tests. We hypothesize that the myopathy in PSACH-MED originates from an underlying tendon and ligament pathology that is a direct result of structural abnormalities to the collagen fibril architecture. This is the first comprehensive characterization of the musculoskeletal phenotype of PSACH-MED and is directly relevant to the clinical management of these patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The loss of slow skeletal muscle troponin T (TnT) results in a recessive nemaline myopathy in the Amish featured with lethal respiratory failure. The genes encoding slow TnT and cardiac troponin I (TnI) are closely linked. Ex vivo promoter analysis suggested that the 5'-enhancer region of the slow TnT gene overlaps with the structure of the upstream cardiac TnI gene. Using transgenic expression of exogenous cardiac TnI to rescue the postnatal lethality of a mouse line in which the entire cardiac TnI gene was deleted, we investigated the effect of enhancer deletion on slow TnT gene expression in vivo and functional consequences. The levels of slow TnT mRNA and protein were significantly reduced in the diaphragm muscle of adult double transgenic mice. The slow TnT-deficient (ssTnT-KD) diaphragm muscle exhibited atrophy and decreased ratios of slow versus fast isoforms of TnT, TnI, and myosin. Consistent with the changes toward more fast myofilament contents, ssTnT-KD diaphragm muscle required stimulation at higher frequency for optimal tetanic force production. The ssTnT-KD diaphragm muscle also exhibited significantly reduced fatigue tolerance, showing faster and more declines of force with slower and less recovery from fatigue as compared with the wild type controls. The natural switch to more slow fiber contents during aging was partially blunted in the ssTnT-KD skeletal muscle. The data demonstrated a critical role of slow TnT in diaphragm function and in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of Amish nemaline myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The intermediate filament protein desmin generates an extra-sarcomeric network in myocytes. Mutations in the desmin gene cause myofibrillar myopathy characterized by desmin-positive aggregates and myofibrillar dissolution. Past analysis revealed that the non-alpha-helical amino-terminal "head" domain of desmin is a vital coordinator of protein assembly. We have now characterized assembly and network-forming properties of five recently discovered myopathy-causing mutations residing in this domain. In vitro analyses with recombinant proteins show that two mutant variants residing in a conserved nonapeptide motif "SSYRRTFGG"-Ser13Phe and Arg16Cys-interfere with assembly by forming filamentous aggregates. Consistent with in vitro data, both mutant proteins are unable to generate a bona fide filament system in cells lacking an intermediate filament cytoskeleton. In cells expressing vimentin or desmin, both mutants firstly fail to integrate into the endogenous filament network and secondly severely affect its cellular localization. The other three mutations-Ser2Iso, Ser46Phe, and Ser46Tyr-influence in vitro filament properties less severely, but in vivo, Ser46Phe and Ser46Tyr impair de novo filament formation. These effects of the "head" mutant proteins on endogenous intermediate filament system and their competition for binding to cellular anchoring structures might explain part of the molecular mechanism that causes disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Lipid-storage myopathy (LSM), defined by triglyceride accumulation in muscle fibres, is a heterogeneous group of lipid metabolic disorders predominantly affecting skeletal muscle. In the past 15 years, more than 200 cases of LSM have been reported in the Chinese literature, but the accurate pathogenic mechanisms are still unknown. OBJECTIVE: In order to gain more insight into the metabolic and genetic dysfunctions of LSM, the authors described a group of Chinese patients with LSM who were very responsive to isolated riboflavin treatment (riboflavin responsive LSM, RR-LSM). METHODS: Nineteen consecutive LSM patients collected during 1995-2007 in our Neuromuscular Laboratory who were dramatically responsive to riboflavin and presented with proximal muscle weakness, exercise intolerance and elevated serum CK but without episodic encephalopathy were subjected to pathological, biochemical and molecular analysis. RESULTS: On the basis of muscle pathology, all 19 patients were diagnosed as LSM. Seventeen patients were suspected of having multiple acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) according to blood acylcarnitine profiles and urine organic acid analysis. Genetic analysis identified 19 novel mutations in ETFDH gene in 18 patients, among which one was homozygote, 16 were compound heterozygotes, and one was a single heterozygote. No pathogenic mutation was detected in ETFA or ETFB genes. Western blot analysis showed there was no significant decrease in ETF:QO expression except for one patient. CONCLUSIONS: The research findings suggest that the majority of Chinese patients with RR-LSM are caused by a mild type of MADD with unique myopathy which is due to ETFDH gene mutation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nebulin is a giant filamentous F-actin-binding protein ( approximately 800 kDa) that binds along the thin filament of the skeletal muscle sarcomere. Nebulin is one of the least well understood major muscle proteins. Although nebulin is usually viewed as a structural protein, here we investigated whether nebulin plays a role in muscle contraction by using skinned muscle fiber bundles from a nebulin knock-out (NEB KO) mouse model. We measured force-pCa (-log[Ca(2+)]) and force-ATPase relations, as well as the rate of tension re-development (k(tr)) in tibialis cranialis muscle fibers. To rule out any alterations in troponin (Tn) isoform expression and/or status of Tn phosphorylation, we studied fiber bundles that had been reconstituted with bacterially expressed fast skeletal muscle recombinant Tn. We also performed a detailed analysis of myosin heavy chain, myosin light chain, and myosin light chain 2 phosphorylation, which showed no significant differences between wild type and NEB KO. Our mechanical studies revealed that NEB KO fibers had increased tension cost (5.9 versus 4.4 pmol millinewtons(-1) mm(-1) s(-1)) and reductions in k(tr) (4.7 versus 7.3 s(-1)), calcium sensitivity (pCa(50) 5.74 versus 5.90), and cooperativity of activation (n(H) 3.64 versus 4.38). Our findings indicate the following: 1) in skeletal muscle nebulin increases thin filament activation, and 2) through altering cross-bridge cycling kinetics, nebulin increases force and efficiency of contraction. These novel properties of nebulin add a new level of understanding of skeletal muscle function and provide a mechanism for the severe muscle weakness in patients with nebulin-based nemaline myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a rare disorder characterized by early joint contractures, muscular dystrophy, and cardiac involvement with conduction defects and arrhythmias. So far, only 35% of EDMD cases are genetically elucidated and associated with EMD or LMNA gene mutations, suggesting the existence of additional major genes. By whole-genome scan, we identified linkage to the Xq26.3 locus containing the FHL1 gene in three informative families belonging to our EMD- and LMNA-negative cohort. Analysis of the FHL1 gene identified seven mutations, in the distal exons of FHL1 in these families, three additional families, and one isolated case, which differently affect the three FHL1 protein isoforms: two missense mutations affecting highly conserved cysteines, one abolishing the termination codon, and four out-of-frame insertions or deletions. The predominant phenotype was characterized by myopathy with scapulo-peroneal and/or axial distribution, as well as joint contractures, and associated with a peculiar cardiac disease characterized by conduction defects, arrhythmias, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in all index cases of the seven families. Heterozygous female carriers were either asymptomatic or had cardiac disease and/or mild myopathy. Interestingly, four of the FHL1-mutated male relatives had isolated cardiac disease, and an overt hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was present in two. Expression and functional studies demonstrated that the FHL1 proteins were severely reduced in all tested patients and that this was associated with a severe delay in myotube formation in the two patients for whom myoblasts were available. In conclusion, FHL1 should be considered as a gene associated with the X-linked EDMD phenotype, as well as with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Families associated with missense mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) present with a rare autosomal dominant multisystem disorder of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), inclusion body myopathy (IBM), and Paget disease of bone (PDB), referred to as IBMPFD. METHODS: We used exon-based genomic DNA sequencing to test for VCP mutations in 123 unrelated Belgian patients with FTLD and their relatives, and the absence of such mutations in 157 control individuals. We analyzed haplotype sharing among mutation carriers by genotyping 8 microsatellite markers in the VCP locus. We obtained family history and clinical and pathologic data using established diagnostic instruments. RESULTS: Mutation analysis of VCP identified 2 Belgian patients with FTLD carrying the p.Arg159His mutation, which segregated in their families. In one family, patients presented with FTLD only, whereas in the other family, patients developed FTLD, PDB, or both without signs of IBM for any of the mutation carriers. We had previously identified p.Arg159His in an Austrian family with patients exhibiting both IBM and PDB. Haplotype sharing analysis indicated that the 3 p.Arg159His families are unrelated. Clinical follow-up of the Austrian family identified dementia symptoms in 1 patient. Autopsy data of 3 patients of the 2 Belgian families revealed FTLD pathology with numerous ubiquitin-immunoreactive, intranuclear inclusions and dystrophic neurites staining positive for TDP-43 protein. CONCLUSIONS: In 3 unrelated families with IBMPFD segregating VCP p.Arg159His, we observed a high degree of clinical heterogeneity and variable penetrance of the 3 cardinal clinical phenotypes: inclusion body myopathy, Paget disease of bone, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. In contrast, the neuropathologic phenotype was consistent with FTLD-TDP type 4.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Murine desnutrin/human ATGL is a triacylglycerol (TAG) hydrolase with a predicted catalytic dyad within an alpha-beta hydrolase fold in the N-terminal region. In humans, mutations resulting in C-terminal truncation cause neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy. To identify critical functional domains, we measured TAG breakdown in cultured cells by mutated or truncated desnutrin. In vitro, C-terminally truncated desnutrin displayed an even higher apparent V(max) than the full-length form without changes in K(m), which may be explained by our finding of an interaction between the C- and N-terminal domains. In live cells, however, C-terminally truncated adenoviral desnutrin had lower TAG hydrolase activity. We investigated a role for the phosphorylation of C-terminal S406 and S430 residues but found that these were not necessary for TAG breakdown or lipid droplet localization in cells. The predicted N-terminal active sites, S47 and D166, were both critical for TAG hydrolysis in live cells and in vitro. We also identified two overlapping N-terminal motifs that predict lipid substrate binding domains, a glycine-rich motif (underlined) and an amphipathic alpha-helix (bold) within amino acid residues 10-24 (ISFAGCGFLGVYHIG). G14, F17, L18, and V20, but not G16 and G19, were important for TAG hydrolysis, suggesting a potential role for the amphipathic alpha-helix in TAG binding. This study identifies for the first time critical sites in the N-terminal region of desnutrin and reveals the requirement of the C-terminal region for TAG hydrolysis in cultured cells.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: The HLA 8.1 ancestral haplotype (HLA-B*08/DRB1*03/DQA1*05/DQB1*02) is associated with adult/juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM), but confers a greater strength of association in patients possessing anti-Jo-1 or anti-PM-Scl antibodies. The HLA-DPB1 gene is centromeric to other HLA class II loci and separated by a recombination hotspot. We investigated whether HLA-DPB1 associations differ between anti-Jo-1 and anti-PM-Scl antibody-positive IIM cases. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-three adult IIM patients (73% females, 49.4 +/-13.6 years) with PM (n = 89), DM (n = 88) and myositis associated with another CTD (n = 55) and 85 juvenile DM patients (75% females, 6.2 +/-3.6 years) were compared with 678 UK Caucasian controls. Patients/controls were genotyped for HLA-DPB1 and DRB1 alleles. Myositis-specific and associated antibodies were identified in cases using immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: HLA-DPB1*0101 was associated with IIM overall [22 vs 13% controls, corrected probability (P(corr)) = 2 x 10(-03); odds ratio (OR) 2.0; 95% CI 1.4, 2.9], PM (P(corr) = 7 x 10(-03); OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.5, 4.4) and anti-Jo-1 (P(corr) = 3 x 10(-5); OR 4.1; 95% CI 2.1, 7.8). No significant DPB1*0101 difference was present between anti-PM-Scl cases and controls. The HLA-DPB1*0101 association in IIM overall cases was dependent on the presence of DRB1*03. A number of HLA-DRB1*03/DPB1 haplotypes were identified, but only DRB1*03/DPB1*0101 was associated with anti-Jo-1 antibody-positive cases. CONCLUSIONS: The HLA-DRB1*03/DPB1*0101 haplotype is a risk factor for anti-Jo-1 antibody-positive IIM. Thus, although DRB1*03 is strongly associated with possession of either anti-Jo-1 or anti-PM-Scl, differing antibody associations are observed at the HLA-DPB1 locus.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Mutations in the four-and-a-half LIM domain 1 gene (FHL1) cause X-linked late-onset scapuloaxioperoneal myopathy characterized by postural muscle atrophy with rigid spine syndrome with pseudoathleticism/hypertrophy (XMPMA), reducing body myopathy (RBM), and scapuloperoneal myopathy. Divergences in these diseases are hitherto unclear; therefore, we searched for additional families to elucidate differences and similarities of these allelic FHL1opathies. METHODS: Using genotyping and phenotyping (mutational analysis, muscle histopathology, and Western blotting) we characterized 10 affected men and 8 women from 7 families. RESULTS: All patients displayed the XMPMA phenotype. In 1 family with a novel missense mutation, 2 affected men had an aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva in addition. In 5 affected men and 2 affected women from 4 families, the C224W missense mutation in FHL1 was detected, which putatively disrupts the fourth LIM domain. In 3 other families with 5 affected men and 1 female, 2 novel missense variants and a novel splice-site mutation in the C terminus of FHL1 were found. Muscle morphology revealed mild to moderate degenerative myopathy with myofiber hypertrophy of both fiber types at younger age and cytoplasmic bodies in the majority of the samples. Reducing bodies, pathognomonic for RBM, were not found. Western blotting revealed no detectable FHL1A protein in our patients. CONCLUSIONS: As a consequence of C terminal FHL1 gene mutations, the X-linked myopathy characterized by postural muscle atrophy (XMPMA) phenotype and morphotype with cytoplasmic bodies are found. In the spectrum of FHL1opathies, the preserved FHL1C protein is likely responsible for the moderate XMPMA phenotype compared with the more severe reducing body myopathy/scapuloperoneal myopathy phenotype.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>By sensing intracellular energy levels, ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channels help regulate vascular tone, glucose metabolism, and cardioprotection. SUR2 mutant mice lack full-length K(ATP) channels in striated and smooth muscle and display a complex phenotype of hypertension and coronary vasospasm. SUR2 mutant mice also display baseline cardioprotection and can withstand acute sympathetic stress better than normal mice. We now studied response to a form of chronic stress, namely that induced by 4 wk of daily exercise on SUR2 mutant mice. Control mice increased exercise capacity by 400% over the training period, while SUR2 mutant mice showed little increase in exercise capacity. Unexercised SUR2 mutant showed necrotic and regenerating fibers in multiple muscle skeletal muscles, including quadriceps, tibialis anterior, and diaphragm muscles. Unlike exercised control animals, SUR2 mutant mice did not lose weight, presumably due to less overall exertion. Unexercised SUR2 mutant mice showed a trend of mildly reduced cardiac function, measured by fractional shortening, (46 +/- 4% vs. 57 +/-7% for SUR2 mutant and control, respectively), and this decrease was not exacerbated by chronic exercise exposure. Despite an improved response to acute sympathetic stress and baseline cardioprotection, exercise intolerance results from lack of SUR2 K(ATP) channels in mice.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Glucocorticoid excess is characterized by increased adiposity, skeletal myopathy, and insulin resistance, but the precise molecular mechanisms are unknown. Within skeletal muscle, 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) converts cortisone (11-dehydrocorticosterone in rodents) to active cortisol (corticosterone in rodents). We aimed to determine the mechanisms underpinning glucocorticoid-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and indentify how 11beta-HSD1 inhibitors improve insulin sensitivity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Rodent and human cell cultures, whole-tissue explants, and animal models were used to determine the impact of glucocorticoids and selective 11beta-HSD1 inhibition upon insulin signaling and action. RESULTS: Dexamethasone decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, decreased IRS1 mRNA and protein expression, and increased inactivating pSer(307) insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1. 11beta-HSD1 activity and expression were observed in human and rodent myotubes and muscle explants. Activity was predominantly oxo-reductase, generating active glucocorticoid. A1 (selective 11beta-HSD1 inhibitor) abolished enzyme activity and blocked the increase in pSer(307) IRS1 and reduction in total IRS1 protein after treatment with 11DHC but not corticosterone. In C57Bl6/J mice, the selective 11beta-HSD1 inhibitor, A2, decreased fasting blood glucose levels and improved insulin sensitivity. In KK mice treated with A2, skeletal muscle pSer(307) IRS1 decreased and pThr(308) Akt/PKB increased. In addition, A2 decreased both lipogenic and lipolytic gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Prereceptor facilitation of glucocorticoid action via 11beta-HSD1 increases pSer(307) IRS1 and may be crucial in mediating insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Selective 11beta-HSD1 inhibition decreases pSer(307) IRS1, increases pThr(308) Akt/PKB, and decreases lipogenic and lipolytic gene expression that may represent an important mechanism underpinning their insulin-sensitizing action.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The fhl1 gene encoding four-and-a-half LIM protein-1 (FHL1) and its spliced isoform, SLIMMER, is mutated in reducing body myopathy, X-linked myopathy with postural muscle atrophy, scapuloperoneal myopathy, and rigid spine syndrome. In this study we have identified a novel function for SLIMMER in delaying skeletal muscle apoptosis via an interaction with the proapoptotic protein Siva-1. Siva-1 was identified as a SLIMMER-specific-interacting protein using yeast two-hybrid screening, direct-binding studies, and glutathione S-transferase pulldown analysis of murine skeletal muscle lysates. In C2C12 skeletal myoblasts, SLIMMER and Siva co-localized in the nucleus; however, both proteins exhibited redistribution to the cytoplasm following the differentiation of mononucleated myoblasts to multinucleated myotubes. In sections of mature skeletal muscle from wild type mice, SLIMMER and Siva-1 co-localized at the Z-line. SLIMMER and Siva-1 were also enriched in Pax-7-positive satellite cells, muscle stem cells that facilitate repair and regeneration. Significantly, SLIMMER delayed Siva-1-dependent apoptosis in C2C12 myoblasts. In skeletal muscle sections from the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, SLIMMER and Siva-1 co-localized in the nucleus of apoptotic myofibers. Therefore, SLIMMER may protect skeletal muscle from apoptosis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVES: Statins are widely prescribed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although statins offer overwhelming cardiovascular benefits, their use can be associated with the development of a statin-induced myopathy. Several factors increase the risk of developing statin-induced myopathy, including the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4149056, located within the gene encoding solute carrier organic anion transporter (SLCO1B1). We aimed to identify the frequency of risk factors for statin-induced myopathy and establish whether the rs4149056 genotype is more prevalent in RA. METHODS: A total of 396 RA patients and 438 non-RA controls were studied. DNA samples were obtained from all patients. The SNP rs4149056 was identified using real-time polymerase chain reaction and melting curve analysis. Genotypic and allelic frequencies were calculated using the chi-squared test. RESULTS: Almost 80% of RA patients had one or more risk factor (range 1-5) for the development of statin-induced myopathy. Of the 74 RA patients treated with statins, 90% had one or more (range 1-4) risk factors. No differences in genotype or allelic frequencies were observed between RA patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: RA patients harbour multiple risk factors for statin-induced myopathy. However, the frequency of the rs4149056 genotypes does not differ according to the presence of RA. Despite this, no cases of statin-induced myopathy were observed in this cohort over a period of four years of follow-up. Thus, we conclude that statin use among RA patients is probably safe, but large-scale prospective studies are needed to confirm this. In the meantime, it may be good practice systematically to consider and record myopathy risk factors in these patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The deficiency of 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase causes a rare autosomal recessive disorder presenting with congenital adrenal insufficiency (CAH) and sexual infantilism. Both 17 alpha-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase reactions are catalyzed by a single polypeptide, cytochrome P450c17 (CYP17), which is encoded by the CYP17A1 gene. We describe the clinical, hormonal, and molecular findings of a 33-yr-old patient presenting with primary amenorrhea, late onset hypertension, and hypokalemic myopathy. The molecular analysis of CYP17A1 revealed a novel homozygous missense mutation resulting in the substitution of arginine to lysine at the amino acid position 21 (p.R21L).</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dynamin 2 (DNM2) is a large GTPase involved in the release of nascent vesicles during endocytosis and intracellular membrane trafficking. Distinct DNM2 mutations, affecting the middle domain (MD) and the Pleckstrin homology domain (PH), have been identified in autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (CNM) and in the intermediate and axonal forms of the Charcot-Marie-Tooth peripheral neuropathy (CMT). We report here the first CNM mutation (c.1948G>A, p.E650 K) in the DNM2 GTPase effector domain (GED), leading to a slowly progressive moderate myopathy. COS7 cells transfected with DNM2 constructs harboring a disease-associated mutation in MD, PH, or GED show a reduced uptake of transferrin and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) complex, two markers of clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis. A decrease in clathrin-mediated endocytosis was also identified in skin fibroblasts from one CNM patient. We studied the impact of DNM2 mutant overexpression on epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2 activation, known to be an endocytosis- and DNM2-dependent process. Activation of ERK1/2 was impaired for all the transfected mutants in COS7 cells, but not in CNM fibroblasts. Our results indicate that impairment of clathrin-mediated endocytosis may play a role in the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to DNM2-related diseases, but the tissue-specific impact of DNM2 mutations in both diseases remains unclear.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In humans, mutations in ZASP (the gene for Z-band alternatively spliced PDZ-motif protein) are associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and left ventricular non-compaction. In particular, mutations in or around the Zasp motif seem to be related to myofibrillar myopathy. Thus, "zaspopathies" include symptoms such as Z-line disgregation, proximal and distal muscle weakness, cardiomyopathies, and peripheral neuropathies. In order to understand the role of ZASP in muscle structure and function, we have performed a molecular characterization of the Drosophila ortholog of human ZASP and a functional analysis following the post-transcriptional silencing of the Drosophila gene. Transcriptional analysis of dzasp has revealed six additional exons, with respect to the known 16, and multiple splice variants. We have produced transgenic lines harboring constructs that, through the use of the UAS/Gal4 binary system, have enabled us to drive dsRNA interference of dzasp in a tissue-specific manner. Knockdown individuals show locomotor defects associated with alterations of muscle structure and ultrastructure, consistent with a role of dzasp specifically in the maintenance of muscular integrity.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The majority of studies on autophagy, a cytoplasmic homeostasis pathway of broad biological and medical significance, have been hitherto focused on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases as the regulators of autophagy. Here, we addressed the reverse process driven by phosphoinositide phosphatases and uncovered a key negative regulatory role in autophagy of a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) phosphatase Jumpy (MTMR14). Jumpy associated with autophagic isolation membranes and early autophagosomes, defined by the key factor Atg16 necessary for proper localization and development of autophagic organelles. Jumpy orchestrated orderly succession of Atg factors by controlling recruitment to autophagic membranes of the sole mammalian Atg factor that interacts with PI3P, WIPI-1 (Atg18), and by affecting the distribution of Atg9 and LC3, the two Atg factors controlling organization and growth of autophagic membranes. A catalytically inactive Jumpy mutant, R336Q, found in congenital disease centronuclear myopathy, lost the ability to negatively regulate autophagy. This work reports for the first time that initiation of autophagy is controlled not only by the forward reaction of generating PI3P through a lipid kinase but that its levels are controlled by a specific PI3P phosphatase, which when defective can lead to human disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In muscle tissue the protein caveolin-3 forms caveolae--flask-shaped invaginations localized on the cytoplasmic surface of the sarcolemmal membrane. Caveolae have a key role in the maintenance of plasma membrane integrity and in the processes of vesicular trafficking and signal transduction. Mutations in the caveolin-3 gene lead to skeletal muscle pathology through multiple pathogenetic mechanisms. Indeed, caveolin-3 deficiency is associated to sarcolemmal membrane alterations, disorganization of skeletal muscle T-tubule network and disruption of distinct cell-signaling pathways. To date, there have been 30 caveolin-3 mutations identified in the human population. Caveolin-3 defects lead to four distinct skeletal muscle disease phenotypes: limb girdle muscular dystrophy, rippling muscle disease, distal myopathy, and hyperCKemia. In addition, one caveolin-3 mutant has been described in a case of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Many patients show an overlap of these symptoms and the same mutation can be linked to different clinical phenotypes. This variability can be related to additional genetic or environmental factors. This review will address caveolin-3 biological functions in muscle cells and will describe the muscle and heart disease phenotypes associated with caveolin-3 mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The giant protein obscurin is thought to link the sarcomere with the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The N-terminus of obscurin interacts with the M-band proteins titin and myomesin, whereas the C-terminus mediates interactions with ankyrin proteins. Here, we investigate the importance of obscurin for SR architecture and organization. Lack of obscurin in cross-striated muscles leads to changes in longitudinal SR architecture and disruption of small ankyrin-1.5 (sAnk1.5) expression and localization. Changes in SR architecture in obscurin knockout mice are also associated with alterations in several SR or SR-associated proteins, such as ankyrin-2 and beta-spectrin. Finally, obscurin knockout mice display centralized nuclei in skeletal muscles as a sign of mild myopathy, but have normal sarcomeric structure and preserved muscle function.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Many patients taking statins often complain of muscle pain and weakness. The extent to which muscle pain reflects muscle injury is unknown. METHODS: We obtained biopsy samples from the vastus lateralis muscle of 83 patients. Of the 44 patients with clinically diagnosed statin-associated myopathy, 29 were currently taking a statin, and 15 had discontinued statin therapy before the biopsy (minimal duration of discontinuation 3 weeks). We also included 19 patients who were taking statins and had no myopathy, and 20 patients who had never taken statins and had no myopathy. We classified the muscles as injured if 2% or more of the muscle fibres in a biopsy sample showed damage. Using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we evaluated the expression levels of candidate genes potentially related to myocyte injury. RESULTS: Muscle injury was observed in 25 (of 44) patients with myopathy and in 1 patient without myopathy. Only 1 patient with structural injury had a circulating level of creatine phosphokinase that was elevated more than 1950 U/L (10x the upper limit of normal). Expression of ryanodine receptor 3 was significantly upregulated in patients with biopsy evidence of structural damage (1.7, standard error of the mean 0.3). INTERPRETATION: Persistent myopathy in patients taking statins reflects structural muscle damage. A lack of elevated levels of circulating creatine phosphokinase does not rule out structural muscle injury. Upregulation of the expression of ryanodine receptor 3 is suggestive of an intracellular calcium leak.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myopathy with deficiency of succinate dehydrogenase and aconitase is a recessively inherited disorder characterized by childhood-onset early fatigue, dyspnoea and palpitations on trivial exercise. The disease is non-progressive, but life-threatening episodes of widespread weakness, severe metabolic acidosis and rhabdomyolysis may occur. The disease has so far only been identified in northern Sweden. The clinical, histochemical and biochemical phenotype is very homogenous and the patients are homozygous for a deep intronic IVS5 + 382G>C splicing affecting mutation in ISCU, which encodes the differently spliced cytosolic and mitochondrial iron-sulphur cluster assembly protein IscU. Iron-sulphur cluster containing proteins are essential for iron homeostasis and respiratory chain function, with IscU being among the most conserved proteins in evolution. We identified a shared homozygous segment of only 405,000 base pair with the deep intronic mutation in eight patients with a phenotype consistent with the original description of the disease. Two other patients, two brothers, had an identical biochemical and histochemical phenotype which is probably pathognomonic for muscle iron-sulphur cluster deficiency, but they presented with a disease where the clinical phenotype was characterized by early onset of a slowly progressive severe muscle weakness, severe exercise intolerance and cardiomyopathy. The brothers were compound heterozygous for the deep intronic mutation and had a c.149 G>A missense mutation in exon 3 changing a completely conserved glycine residue to a glutamate. The missense mutation was inherited from their mother who was of Finnish descent. The intronic mutation affects mRNA splicing and results in inclusion of pseudoexons in most transcripts in muscle. The pseudoexon inclusion results in a change in the reading frame and appearance of a premature stop codon. In western blot analysis of protein extracts from fibroblasts, there was no pronounced reduction of IscU in any of the patients, but the analysis revealed that the species corresponding to mitochondrial IscU migrates slower than a species present only in whole cells. In protein extracted from isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria the western blot analysis revealed a severe deficiency of IscU in the homozygous patients and appearance of a faint new fraction that could represent a truncated protein. There was only a slight reduction of mitochondrial IscU in the compound heterozygotes, despite their severe phenotype, indicating that the IscU expressed in these patients is non-functional.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The ACTA1 gene encodes skeletal muscle alpha-actin, which is the predominant actin isoform in the sarcomeric thin filaments of adult skeletal muscle, and essential, along with myosin, for muscle contraction. ACTA1 disease-causing mutations were first described in 1999, when a total of 15 mutations were known. In this article we describe 177 different disease-causing ACTA1 mutations, including 85 that have not been described before. ACTA1 mutations result in five overlapping congenital myopathies: nemaline myopathy; intranuclear rod myopathy; actin filament aggregate myopathy; congenital fiber type disproportion; and myopathy with core-like areas. Mixtures of these histopathological phenotypes may be seen in a single biopsy from one patient. Irrespective of the histopathology, the disease is frequently clinically severe, with many patients dying within the first year of life. Most mutations are dominant and most patients have de novo mutations not present in the peripheral blood DNA of either parent. Only 10% of mutations are recessive and they are genetic or functional null mutations. To aid molecular diagnosis and establishing genotype-phenotype correlations, we have developed a locus-specific database for ACTA1 variations (http://waimr.uwa.edu.au).</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Mutations of the selenoprotein N gene (SEPN1) cause SEPN1-related myopathy (SEPN1-RM), a novel early-onset muscle disorder formerly divided into four different nosological categories. Selenoprotein N (SelN) is the only selenoprotein involved in a genetic disease; its function being unknown, no treatment is available for this potentially lethal disorder. Our objective was to clarify the role of SelN and the pathophysiology of SEPN1-RM to identify therapeutic targets. METHODS: We established and analyzed an ex vivo model of SelN deficiency using fibroblast and myoblast primary cultures from patients with null SEPN1 mutations. DCFH assay, OxyBlot, Western blot, Fura-2, and cell survival studies were performed to measure intracellular oxidant activity, oxidative stress markers, calcium handling, and response to exogenous treatments. RESULTS: SelN-depleted cells showed oxidative/nitrosative stress manifested by increased intracellular oxidant activity (reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide) and/or excessive oxidation of proteins, including the contractile proteins actin and myosin heavy chain II in myotubes. SelN-devoid myotubes showed also Ca(2+) homeostasis abnormalities suggesting dysfunction of the redox-sensor Ca(2+) channel ryanodine receptor type 1. Furthermore, absence of SelN was associated with abnormal susceptibility to H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress, demonstrated by increased cell death. This cell phenotype was restored by pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. INTERPRETATION: SelN plays a key role in redox homeostasis and human cell protection against oxidative stress. Oxidative/nitrosative stress is a primary pathogenic mechanism in SEPN1-RM, which can be effectively targeted ex vivo by antioxidants. These findings pave the way to SEPN1-RM treatment, which would represent a first specific pharmacological treatment for a congenital myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Cap disease is a rare congenital myopathy associated with skeletal malformations and respiratory involvement. Abnormally arranged myofibrils taking the appearance of a "cap" are the morphological hallmark of this entity. We report a case of cap disease concerning a 42-year-old man, without any family history and presenting a p.Arg168His mutation on the TPM3 gene. His first biopsy at 7years had only shown selective type I hypotrophy. Mutations of TPM3 gene have been found in nemaline myopathy, congenital fiber type disproportion, but never before in cap disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The nucleic acid binding protein TDP-43 was recently identified in normal myonuclei and in the sarcoplasm of inclusion body myositis (IBM) muscle. Here we found TDP-43 sarcoplasmic immunoreactivity in 23% of IBM myofibers, while other reported IBM biomarkers were less frequent, with rimmed vacuoles in 2.8%, fluorescent Congo red material in 0.57%, SMI-31 immunoreactivity in 0.83%, and focal R1282 beta-amyloid immunoreactivity in 0.00% of myofibers. The presence of as little as >1% of myofibers with nonnuclear sarcoplasmic TDP-43 was highly sensitive (91%) and specific (100%) to IBM among 50 inflammatory myopathy patient samples, although some patients with hereditary inclusion body myopathies and myofibrillar myopathy also had sarcoplasmic TDP-43. TDP-43 mutations were sought, and none were identified. TDP-43 could be one of many nucleic acid binding proteins that are abnormally present in IBM sarcoplasm. They could potentially interfere with the normal function of extranuclear RNAs that maintain myofiber protein production.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Variations in the mitochondrial helicase Twinkle (PEO1) gene are usually associated with autosomal dominant chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). We describe five patients from two unrelated Alsatian families with the new R374W variation in the Twinkle linker region who progressively developed an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder with PEO, hearing loss, myopathy, dysphagia, dysphonia, sensory neuropathy, and late-onset dementia resembling Alzheimer's disease. These observations demonstrate that Twinkle variations in the linker domain alter cerebral function and further implicate disrupted mitochondrial DNA integrity in the pathogenesis of dementia.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hereditary inclusion body myopathy associated with early-onset Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (hIBMPFTD) is a degenerative disorder caused by single substitutions in highly conserved residues of p97/VCP. All mutations identified thus far cluster within the NH(2) domain or the D1 ring, which are both required for communicating conformational changes to adaptor protein complexes. In this study, biochemical approaches were used to identify the consequences of the mutations R155P and A232E on p97/VCP structure. Assessment of p97/VCP oligomerization revealed that p97(R155P) and p97(A232E) formed hexameric ring-shaped structures of approximately 600 kDa. p97(R155P) and p97(A232E) exhibited an approximately 3-fold increase in ATPase activity compared to wild-type p97 (p97(WT)) and displayed increased sensitivity to heat-induced upregulation of ATPase activity. Protein fluorescence analysis provided evidence for conformational differences in the D2 rings of both hIBMPFTD mutants. Furthermore, both mutations increased the proteolytic susceptibility of the D2 ring. The solution structures of all p97/VCP proteins revealed a didispersed distribution of a predominant hexameric population and a minor population of large-diameter complexes. ATP binding significantly increased the abundance of large-diameter complexes for p97(R155P) and p97(A232E), but not p97(WT) or the ATP-binding mutant p97(K524A). Therefore, we propose that hIBMPFTD p97/VCP mutants p97(R155P) and p97(A232E) possess structural defects that may compromise the mechanism of p97/VCP activity within large multiprotein complexes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlinopathy refers to a variety of autosomal recessive, skeletal muscle disorders due to the mutations of dysferlin-encoding gene, DYSF. It encompasses limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B), Miyoshi myopathy (MM), distal myopathy with anterior tibial onset (DMAT), isolated hyperCKemia, rigid spine syndrome and congenital muscular dystrophy. Herein, we report five Thai patients with distal myopathy due to dysferlinopathy including four MM and one DMAT patients. Muscle biopsy from one MM patient depicted numerous ring fibers which is an atypical finding in dysferlinopathy. Mutation analysis of DYSF revealed novel compound heterozygous mutations of p.Tyr309X and c.236+1G>T in two related MM patients, known homozygous mutations, p.Arg89X and p.Gln176X, in two MM patients and a heterozygous missense mutation, p.Arg555Trp, in a DMAT patient. Most of the previously reported DMAT patients were Hispanic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of genetically confirmed patients with dysferlinopathy in Thailand.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In 2005 the commonality of sarcotubular myopathy (STM) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H (LGMD2H) was demonstrated, as both are caused by the p D487N missense mutation in TRIM32 originally found in the Manitoba Hutterite population. Recently, three novel homozygous TRIM32 mutations have been described in LGMD patients. Here we describe a three generation Swedish family clinically presenting with limb girdle muscular weakness and histological features of a microvacuolar myopathy. The two index patients were compound heterozygotes for a frameshift mutation in TRIM32 (c.1560delC ) and a 30 kb intragenic deletion, encompassing parts of intron 1 and the entire exon 2 of TRIM32. In these patients, no full-length or truncated TRIM32 could be detected. Interestingly, heterozygous family members carrying only one mutation showed mild clinical symptoms and vacuolar changes in muscle. In our family, the phenotype encompasses additionally a mild demyelinating polyneuropathic syndrome. Thus STM and LGMD2H are the result of loss of function mutations that can be either deletions or missense mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Regulation of mitochondrial protein expression is crucial for the function of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. Although the basal machinery for mitochondrial transcription is known, the regulatory mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, we characterized mTERF2, a mitochondria-localized homolog of the mitochondrial transcription termination factor mTERF1. We show that inactivation of mTERF2 in the mouse results in a myopathy and memory deficits associated with decreased levels of mitochondrial transcripts and imbalanced tRNA pool. These aberrations were associated with decreased steady-state levels of OXPHOS proteins causing a decrease in respiratory function. mTERF2 binds to the mtDNA promoter region, suggesting that it affects transcription initiation. In vitro interaction studies suggest that mtDNA mediates interactions between mTERF2 and mTERF3. Our results indicate that mTERF1, mTERF2, and mTERF3 regulate transcription by acting in the same site in the mtDNA promoter region and thereby mediate fine-tuning of mitochondrial transcription and hence OXPHOS function.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) is a vasodilator; its plasma levels are altered in several human diseases, including migraine, hypertension and diabetes. CGRP is locally released by motor neurons, and is overexpressed in response to surgical or pharmacological blockage of neuromuscular transmission. Additionally to a brief discussion with regard to the clinical relevance of CGRP, this review focuses on the effects of CGRP on skeletal muscle excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, as well as the corresponding pathophysiological consequences. EC coupling involves activation of 2 different types of calcium channels: dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) located at the sarcolemma, and ryanodine receptors (RyR1s) located at the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). In response to electrical depolarization, DHPRs activate nearby and physically bound RyR1s, allowing Ca(2+) from the SR to move into the cytosol (termed voltage-gated Ca(2+) release, or VGCR). We recently found that CGRP stimulates VGCR by 350 % in as short as 1h. This effect, which lasts for at least 48 h, is due to activation of the CGRP receptor, and requires activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. CGRP also increases the amplitude of caffeine-induced Ca(2+) release (400 %); suggesting increased SR Ca(2+) content underlies stimulation of VGCR. Interestingly, in the long-term CGRP also increases the density of sarcolemmal DHPRs (up to 30%, within 24-48 h). We propose that these CGRP effects may contribute to prevent and/or restore symptoms in central core disease (CCD); a congenital myopathy that is linked to mutations in the gene encoding RyR1.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>PURPOSE: To describe the first cataract-causing recessive mutation in the crystalline, alpha-b gene CRYAB. METHODS: Homozygosity mapping complemented by linkage analysis was performed in a family with autosomal recessive juvenile cataract. RESULTS: A homozygous missense mutation in CRYAB was identified. The mutation replaces a highly conserved amino acid residue in a dual function domain of the protein. None of the patients has clinically significant myopathy, but the oldest patient (the mother) has retinal pathology. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a recessive mutation in CRYAB causing cataract. Based on recent knowledge of the structure and function of this small heat shock protein, we speculate on the potential mutational mechanism.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotilin is a muscle-specific Z disk protein. Several missense mutations in the myotilin gene (MYOT) have been identified in limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), myofibrillar myopathy, and distal myopathy patients. All previously reported pathogenic MYOT mutations have been identified only in Exon 2. We sequenced MYOT in 138 patients diagnosed as having LGMD, myofibrillar myopathy, or distal myopathy, and identified a novel MYOT mutation in Exon 9 encoding the second immunoglobulin-like domain in 1 patient with clinically typical LGMD. By light microscopy, there were scattered fibers with rimmed vacuoles and myofibrillary disorganization in the patient's muscle biopsy; accumulation of Z disk proteins was observed by immunohistochemistry. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that the amount of myotilin monomer was increased in the patient muscle, but that the myotilin homodimeric band was decreased. Functional analysis of the myotilin mutation using a yeast 2-hybrid system revealed defective homodimerization of the mutant myotilin and decreased interaction between mutant myotilin and alpha-actinin. The homodimerization defect was further demonstrated by immunoprecipitation. This is the first MYOT mutation outside of Exon 2 in an LGMD type 1A patient and the first MYOT mutation identified in the Japanese population. This mutation in the second immunoglobulin-like domain impairs myotilin dimerization and alters the binding between myotilin and alpha-actinin, which is known to be important for actin bundling.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A disulfide relay system (DRS) was recently identified in the yeast mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) that consists of two essential components: the sulfhydryl oxidase Erv1 and the redox-regulated import receptor Mia40. The DRS drives the import of cysteine-rich proteins into the IMS via an oxidative folding mechanism. Erv1p is reoxidized within this system, transferring its electrons to molecular oxygen through interactions with cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase (COX), thereby linking the DRS to the respiratory chain. The role of the human Erv1 ortholog, GFER, in the DRS has been poorly explored. Using homozygosity mapping, we discovered that a mutation in the GFER gene causes an infantile mitochondrial disorder. Three children born to healthy consanguineous parents presented with progressive myopathy and partial combined respiratory-chain deficiency, congenital cataract, sensorineural hearing loss, and developmental delay. The consequences of the mutation at the level of the patient's muscle tissue and fibroblasts were 1) a reduction in complex I, II, and IV activity; 2) a lower cysteine-rich protein content; 3) abnormal ultrastructural morphology of the mitochondria, with enlargement of the IMS space; and 4) accelerated time-dependent accumulation of multiple mtDNA deletions. Moreover, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae erv1(R182H) mutant strain reproduced the complex IV activity defect and exhibited genetic instability of the mtDNA and mitochondrial morphological defects. These findings shed light on the mechanisms of mitochondrial biogenesis, establish the role of GFER in the human DRS, and promote an understanding of the pathogenesis of a new mitochondrial disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Statins are widely used to treat hypercholesterolemia but can lead to a number of side effects in muscle, including rhabdomyolysis. Our recent findings implicated the induction of atrogin-1, a gene required for the development of muscle atrophy, in statin-induced muscle damage. Since statins inhibit many biochemical reactions besides cholesterol synthesis, we sought to define the statin-inhibited pathways responsible for atrogin-1 expression and muscle damage. We report here that lovastatin-induced atrogin-1 expression and muscle damage in cultured mouse myotubes and zebrafish can be prevented in the presence of geranylgeranol but not farnesol. Further, inhibitors of the transfer of geranylgeranyl isoprene units to protein targets cause statin muscle damage and atrogin-1 induction in cultured cells and in fish. These findings support the concept that dysfunction of small GTP-binding proteins lead to statin-induced muscle damage since these molecules require modification by geranylgeranyl moieties for their cellular localization and activity. Collectively, our animal and in vitro findings shed light on the molecular mechanism of statin-induced myopathy and suggest that atrogin-1 may be regulated by novel signaling pathways.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Neutral lipid storage disease (NLSD) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by the excessive accumulation of neutral lipids in multiple tissues. Recently, two genes, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL/PNPLA2) and comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58/ABHD5), have been shown to cause NLSD. ATGL specifically hydrolyzes the first fatty acid from triacylglycerols (TG) and CGI-58/ABHD5 stimulates ATGL activity by a currently unknown mechanism. Mutations in both the ATGL and the CGI-58 genes are associated with systemic TG accumulation, yet the resulting clinical manifestations are not identical. Patients with defective ATGL function suffer from more severe myopathy (NLSDM) than patients with defective CGI-58 function. On the other hand, CGI-58 mutations are always associated with ichthyosis (NLSDI), which was not observed in patients with defective ATGL function. These observations indicate an ATGL-independent function of CGI-58. This review summarizes recent findings with the goal of relating structural variants of ATGL and CGI-58 to functional consequences in lipid metabolism.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal X-linked genetic disorder of skeletal muscle caused by mutation in dystrophin gene. Although the degradation of skeletal muscle extracellular matrix, inflammation and fibrosis are the common pathological features in DMD, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we have investigated the role and the mechanisms by which increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) protein causes myopathy in dystrophin-deficient mdx mice. The levels of MMP-9 but not tissue inhibitor of MMPs were drastically increased in skeletal muscle of mdx mice. Besides skeletal muscle, infiltrating macrophages were found to contribute significantly to the elevated levels of MMP-9 in dystrophic muscle. In vivo administration of a nuclear factor-kappa B inhibitory peptide, NBD, blocked the expression of MMP-9 in dystrophic muscle of mdx mice. Deletion of Mmp9 gene in mdx mice improved skeletal muscle structure and functions and reduced muscle injury, inflammation and fiber necrosis. Inhibition of MMP-9 increased the levels of cytoskeletal protein beta-dystroglycan and neural nitric oxide synthase and reduced the amounts of caveolin-3 and transforming growth factor-beta in myofibers of mdx mice. Genetic ablation of MMP-9 significantly augmented the skeletal muscle regeneration in mdx mice. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of MMP-9 activity also ameliorated skeletal muscle pathogenesis and enhanced myofiber regeneration in mdx mice. Collectively, our study suggests that the increased production of MMP-9 exacerbates dystrophinopathy and MMP-9 represents as one of the most promising therapeutic targets for the prevention of disease progression in DMD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: We have reported that doxycycline-induced over-expression of wild type prion protein (PrP) in skeletal muscles of Tg(HQK) mice is sufficient to cause a primary myopathy with no signs of peripheral neuropathy. The preferential accumulation of the truncated PrP C1 fragment was closely correlated with these myopathic changes. In this study we use gene expression profiling to explore the temporal program of molecular changes underlying the PrP-mediated myopathy. RESULTS: We used DNA microarrays, and confirmatory real-time PCR and Western blot analysis to demonstrate deregulation of a large number of genes in the course of the progressive myopathy in the skeletal muscles of doxycycline-treated Tg(HQK) mice. These include the down-regulation of genes coding for the myofibrillar proteins and transcription factor MEF2c, and up-regulation of genes for lysosomal proteins that is concomitant with increased lysosomal activity in the skeletal muscles. Significantly, there was prominent up-regulation of p53 and p53-regulated genes involved in cell cycle arrest and promotion of apoptosis that paralleled the initiation and progression of the muscle pathology. CONCLUSION: The data provides the first in vivo evidence that directly links p53 to a wild type PrP-mediated disease. It is evident that several mechanistic features contribute to the myopathy observed in PrP over-expressing mice and that p53-related apoptotic pathways appear to play a major role.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hypoglycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan characterizes a subgroup of muscular dystrophies of variable severity, including Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy. We found fukutin gene mutations in a 4.5-year-old Italian patient, with reduced alpha-dystroglycan expression, dystrophic features on muscle biopsy, hypotonia since birth, mild myopathy, but no brain involvement. Mutations in the fukutin gene can be associated with much milder phenotypes than classical Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, and, although rare, can occur in non-Japanese.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Troponin T (TnT) is a striated muscle-specific protein and an abundant component of the myofilaments. Nonmyofilament-associated TnT is rapidly degraded in myocytes, implying an importance in the maintenance of the cellular environment. However, if the level of nonmyofilament-associated TnT or TnT fragments exceeds the degradation capacity, it may cause cytotoxicity. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed bicistronic vectors to express different portions of TnT polypeptide chain, together with nonfusion green fluorescent protein as a tracer for the transfection. Cytotoxicity of the TnT fragments was studied through forced expression in C(2)C(12) myoblasts and human embryonic kidney-293 nonmuscle cells and examination of the viability of the transfected cells. The results demonstrated that, in the absence of myofilaments, the conserved COOH-terminal and middle fragments of TnT were highly effective on inducing cell death via apoptosis, whereas the NH(2)-terminal variable region was not. As combined effects, nonmyofilament-associated intact cardiac TnT and a COOH-terminal truncated slow TnT fragment found in Amish nemaline myopathy exhibited intermediate cytotoxicity. A particular significance of this finding is that peak releases of TnT or TnT fragments from decomposition of a large number of myofibrils in acute myocardial infarction may breach the cellular protection of proteolytic degradation and result in apoptosis as a potential cause for the loss of cardiomyocytes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy (XMEA) is a childhood-onset disease characterized by progressive vacuolation and atrophy of skeletal muscle. We show that XMEA is caused by hypomorphic alleles of the VMA21 gene, that VMA21 is the diverged human ortholog of the yeast Vma21p protein, and that like Vma21p it is an essential assembly chaperone of the V-ATPase, the principal mammalian proton pump complex. Decreased VMA21 raises lysosomal pH, which reduces lysosomal degradative ability and blocks autophagy. This reduces cellular free amino acids, which upregulates the mTOR pathway and mTOR-dependent macroautophagy, resulting in proliferation of large and ineffective autolysosomes that engulf sections of cytoplasm, merge together, and vacuolate the cell. Our results uncover macroautophagic overcompensation leading to cell vacuolation and tissue atrophy as a mechanism of disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Isolated cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency (MIM#220110) is a relatively common biochemical finding in pediatric patients with mitochondrial disorder. It has been associated with different clinical phenotypes ranging from isolated myopathy to severe multisystem disorder. It is a genetically heterogeneous trait, and the most frequent genetic defects affect SURF1 and SCO2, two genes required for COX assembly. However, a significant proportion of patients lacks mutation in these genes and in other known genes that require COX biogenesis. COX18 is a novel COX assembly gene required for membrane insertion of the C-terminal portion of COX subunit II. We have studied 29 pediatric patients with isolated COX deficiency in the skeletal muscle associated with different clinical phenotypes. Mutations in SURF1, SCO2, SCO1, COX10, COX15 and in mitochondrial DNA, had been ruled out earlier. The COX18 gene was analyzed using a PCR-single-stranded conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) protocol, and in 15 patients, the analysis was repeated by direct sequencing. No pathogenic mutations were detected in our cohort of patients indicating that COX18 mutations may be very rare or associated with other phenotypes than isolated COX deficiency in infancy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report the clinical, histological and genetic findings in 10 families (19 patients) presenting mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP). The mean age at onset was 42 years. The clinical pattern was characterized by an early involvement of the proximal upper limbs with scapular winging. Axial and lower limb muscles were often affected, whereas facial, oculobulbar muscles were spared. Ten patients were wheelchair bound after a mean disease course of 9 years and six patients required canes for walking. Two patients required mechanically assisted ventilation and seven patients had reduced vital capacity. There was no cardiac involvement. Paget's disease of bone was observed in eight patients and cognitive impairment in nine patients. Seven patients died as a consequence of weakness and respiratory distress. Muscle biopsy showed rimmed vacuolar myopathy. Genetic analysis revealed missense heterozygous mutations mostly located in exon 5 of the VCP gene, four of which were not previously reported. We observed intrafamilial and interfamilial variability in terms of severity, distribution of weakness and presence or not of Paget's disease or cognitive impairment.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) can be caused by a disorder characterized by multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions due to mutations in the TWINKLE gene, encoding a mtDNA helicase. We describe a 71-year-old woman who had developed PEO at age 55 years. She had cataracts, diabetes, paresthesias, cognitive defects, memory problems, hearing loss, and sensory ataxia. She had muscle weakness with ragged red fibers on biopsy. MRI showed static white matter changes. A c.908G>A substitution (p.R303Q) in the TWINKLE gene was identified. Multiple mtDNA deletions were detected in muscle but not blood by a PCR-based method, but not by Southern blot analysis. MtDNA copy number was maintained in blood and muscle. A systematic literature search was used to identify the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of dominant TWINKLE-related disease. Patients were adults with PEO and symptoms including myopathy, neuropathy, dysarthria or dysphagia, sensory ataxia, and parkinsonism. Diabetes, cataract, memory loss, hearing loss, and cardiac problems were infrequent. All reported mutations clustered between amino acids 303 and 508 with no mutations at the N-terminal half of the gene. The TWINKLE gene should be analyzed in adults with PEO even in the absence of mtDNA deletions in muscle on Southern blot analysis, and of a family history for PEO. The pathogenic mutations identified 5' beyond the linker region suggest a functional role for this part of the protein despite the absence of a primase function in humans. In our patient, the pathogenesis involved multiple mtDNA deletions without reduction in mtDNA copy number.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the gene encoding tripartite motif protein 32 (TRIM32) cause two seemingly diverse diseases: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H (LGMD2H) or sarcotubular myopathy (STM) and Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 11(BBS11). Although TRIM32 is involved in protein ubiquitination, its substrates and the molecular consequences of disease-causing mutations are poorly understood. In this paper, we show that TRIM32 is a widely expressed ubiquitin ligase that is localized to the Z-line in skeletal muscle. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that TRIM32 binds and ubiquitinates dysbindin, a protein implicated in the genetic aetiology of schizophrenia, augmenting its degradation. Small-interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of TRIM32 in myoblasts resulted in elevated levels of dysbindin. Importantly, the LGMD2H/STM-associated TRIM32 mutations, D487N and R394H impair ubiquitin ligase activity towards dysbindin and were mislocalized in heterologous cells. These mutants were able to self-associate and also co-immunoprecipitated with wild-type TRIM32 in transfected cells. Furthermore, the D487N mutant could bind to both dysbindin and its E2 enzyme but was defective in monoubiquitination. In contrast, the BBS11 mutant P130S did not show any biochemical differences compared with the wild-type protein. Our data identify TRIM32 as a regulator of dysbindin and demonstrate that the LGMD2H/STM mutations may impair substrate ubiquitination.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathy (NM) is the most common non-dystrophic congenital myopathy. Clinically the most important feature of NM is muscle weakness; however, the mechanisms underlying this weakness are poorly understood. Here, we studied the muscular phenotype of NM patients with a well-defined nebulin mutation (NM-NEB), using a multidisciplinary approach to study thin filament length regulation and muscle contractile performance. SDS-PAGE and western blotting revealed greatly reduced nebulin levels in skeletal muscle of NM-NEB patients, with the most prominent reduction at nebulin's N-terminal end. Muscle mechanical studies indicated approximately 60% reduced force generating capacity of NM-NEB muscle and a leftward-shift of the force-sarcomere length relation in NM-NEB muscle fibers. This indicates that the mechanism for the force reduction is likely to include shorter and non-uniform thin filament lengths in NM-NEB muscle compared with control muscle. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy and electron microscopy studies indicated that average thin filament length is reduced from approximately 1.3 microm in control muscle to approximately 0.75 microm in NM-NEB muscle. Thus, the present study is the first to show a distinct genotype-functional phenotype correlation in patients with NM due to a nebulin mutation, and provides evidence for the notion that dysregulated thin filament length contributes to muscle weakness in NM patients with nebulin mutations. Furthermore, a striking similarity between the contractile and structural phenotypes of nebulin-deficient mouse muscle and human NM-NEB muscle was observed, indicating that the nebulin knockout model is well suited for elucidating the functional basis of muscle weakness in NM and for the development of treatment strategies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Malignant hyperthermia (MH), linked to the ryanodine receptor 1 gene (RYR1) on chromosome 19, is a potentially lethal pharmacogenetic disorder which may lead to a disturbance of intracellular calcium homeostasis when susceptible individuals are exposed to halogenated anaesthetics, suxamethonium, or both. Central core disease (CCD) is a rare dominantly inherited congenital myopathy allelic to MH-susceptibility. METHODS: In this study, 14 unrelated MH-susceptible probands and one CCD patient from Sweden were screened for mutations in the RYR1. Since the RYR1 is also expressed in B-lymphocytes, RYR1-cDNA was transcribed from total RNA extracted from white blood cells. RESULTS: We detected two known RYR1 mutations and two previously described unclassified sequence variants. In addition, six novel sequence variants were detected. All mutations or sequence variants were verified on genomic DNA. Seven of the probands did not show any candidate mutation, although the total coding region of RYR1 was sequenced. Segregation data in in vitro contracture tested family members of three probands support a causative role of three of the novel sequence variants. CONCLUSIONS: Our study contributes to the genetic aetiology of MH in Sweden, but also raises questions about the involvement of genes other than RYR1 since nearly half of the probands did not show any sequence variants in the total coding region of the RYR1.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We present the cases of 3 patients with a histidine-to-arginine substitution at position 46 of the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene. Consistent with previous reports, the initial symptom in each patient was unilateral weakness in the distal leg muscles. Remarkably, muscular atrophy in these patients during the early stage of the disease was more specific to the flexor muscle group, with the extensor muscle group remaining intact over long-term observation. More interestingly, biopsy of the affected muscle in the early stage of the disease revealed necrotic and regenerative myofibers with infiltration of lymphocytes, resembling inflammatory myopathy. These novel findings might provide further insights into the pathophysiology of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Distal myopathies represent a heterogeneous group of inherited skeletal muscle disorders. One type of adult-onset, progressive autosomal-dominant distal myopathy, frequently associated with dysphagia and dysphonia (vocal cord and pharyngeal weakness with distal myopathy [VCPDM]), has been mapped to chromosome 5q31 in a North American pedigree. Here, we report the identification of a second large VCPDM family of Bulgarian descent and fine mapping of the critical interval. Sequencing of positional candidate genes revealed precisely the same nonconservative S85C missense mutation affecting an interspecies conserved residue in the MATR3 gene in both families. MATR3 is expressed in skeletal muscle and encodes matrin 3, a component of the nuclear matrix, which is a proteinaceous network that extends throughout the nucleus. Different disease related haplotype signatures in the two families provided evidence that two independent mutational events at the same position in MATR3 cause VCPDM. Our data establish proof of principle that the nuclear matrix is crucial for normal skeletal muscle structure and function and put VCPDM on the growing list of monogenic disorders associated with the nuclear proteome.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myosin storage myopathy (MSM) is a congenital myopathy characterized by the presence of subsarcolemmal inclusions of myosin in the majority of type I muscle fibers, and has been linked to 4 mutations in the slow/cardiac muscle myosin, beta-MyHC (MYH7). Although the majority of the >230 disease causing mutations in MYH7 are located in the globular head region of the molecule, those responsible for MSM are part of a subset of MYH7 mutations that are located in the alpha-helical coiled-coil tail. Mutations in the myosin head are thought to affect the ATPase and actin-binding properties of the molecule. To date, however, there are no reports of the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis for mutations in the rod region of muscle myosins. Here, we present analysis of 4 mutations responsible for MSM: L1793P, R1845W, E1886K, and H1901L. We show that each MSM mutation has a different molecular phenotype, suggesting that there are multiple mechanisms by which MSM can be caused. These mechanisms range from thermodynamic and functional irregularities of individual proteins (L1793P), to varying defects in the assembly and stability of filaments formed from the proteins (R1845W, E1886K, and H1901L). In addition to furthering our understanding of MSM, these observations provide the first insight into how mutations affect the rod region of muscle myosins, and provide a framework for future studies of disease-causing mutations in this region of the molecule.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the gene encoding dysferlin (DYSF) cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy (MM). We were able to examine eight patients suspected of LGMD2B clinically, histochemically. The genotype was determined in every case. We found sarcolemmal and interstitial amyloid deposits in four muscle sections. All of the mutations associated with amyloid were located in the N-terminal region of dysferlin, and dysferlin clearly proved to be a component of the amyloid deposits. Dysferlin-deficient muscular dystrophy is the first muscular dystrophy in which amyloidosis is involved. This fact must be considered in the process of developing therapeutic strategies. The influence of the amyloid deposits on the pathogenesis of the disease and the possible involvement of other organs in the progressive course are as yet unclear.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We describe two Chilean patients with dysferlinopathy, a 32-year-old man with Miyoshi's distal myopathy and a 29-year-old woman with a proximodistal phenotype. Absence of dysferlin in frozen muscle biopsy allowed diagnostic confirmation. In these two patients, two mutations not previously identified in other populations were found: a homozygous c.1948delC (p.Leu650TyrfsX6) was found in the male patient; the heterozygous mutation c.1276G>A (p.Gly426Arg) was found in the female patient in association with the previously reported c.2858dupT (p.Phe954ValfsX2). To our knowledge, this is the first time that mutations in DYSF are identified in native Chileans. Our findings suggest the possibility that mutations in the DYSF gene were present in the Native American population before colonization.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Molecular diagnosis of monogenic diseases with high genetic heterogeneity is usually challenging. In the case of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, multiplex Western blot analysis is a very useful initial step, but that often fails to identify the primarily affected protein. We report how homozygosity analysis using a genome-wide SNP array allowed us to solve the diagnostic enigma in a patient with a moderate form of LGMD, born from consanguineous parents. The genome-wide scan performed on the patient's DNA revealed several regions of homozygosity, that were compared to the location of known LGMD genes. One such region indeed contained the TRIM32 gene. This gene was previously found mutated in families with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H (LGMD2H), a mild autosomal recessive myopathy described in Hutterite populations and in 4 patients with a diagnosis of sarcotubular myopathy. A single missense mutation was found in all these patients, located in a conserved domain of the C-terminal part of the protein. Another missense mutation affecting the N-terminal part of TRIM32, observed in a single consanguineous Bedouin family, was reported to cause the phenotypically unrelated and genetically heterogeneous Bardet-Biedl syndrome, defining the BBS11 locus. Sequencing of TRIM32 in our patient revealed a distal frameshift mutation, c.1753_1766dup14 (p.Ile590Leu fsX38). Together with two recently reported mutations, this novel mutation confirms that integrity of the C-terminal domain of TRIM32 is necessary for muscle maintenance.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene have been associated with a wide range of phenotypes including the malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility trait, Central Core Disease (CCD) and other congenital myopathies characterized by early onset and predominant proximal weakness. We report a patient presenting at 77 years with a predominant axial myopathy associated with prominent involvement of spine extensors, confirmed on MRI and muscle biopsy, compatible with a core myopathy. RYR1 mutational analysis revealed a novel heterozygous missense mutation (c.119G>T; p.Gly40Val) affecting the RYR1 N-terminus, previously predominantly associated with MH susceptibility. This case expands the spectrum of RYR1-related phenotypes and suggests that MH-related RYR1 mutations may give rise to overt neuromuscular symptoms later in life, with clinical features not typically found in CCD due to C-terminal hotspot mutations. Late-onset congenital myopathies may be under-recognised and diagnosis requires a high degree of clinical suspicion.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) and Bethlem myopathy are inherited muscle disorders caused by mutations of genes encoding the extracellular matrix protein collagen VI (ColVI). Mice lacking ColVI (Col6a1(-/-)) display a myopathic phenotype associated with ultrastructural alterations of mitochondria and sarcoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial dysfunction with abnormal opening of the permeability transition pore (PTP) and increased apoptosis of muscle fibers. Treatment with cyclosporin (Cs) A, a drug that desensitizes the PTP by binding to cyclophilin (Cyp)-D, was shown to rescue myofiber alterations in Col6a1(-/-) mice and in UCMD patients, suggesting a correlation between PTP opening and pathogenesis of ColVI muscular dystrophies. Here, we show that inactivation of the gene encoding for Cyp-D rescues the disease phenotype of ColVI deficiency. In the absence of Cyp-D, Col6a1(-/-) mice show negligible myofiber degeneration, rescue from mitochondrial dysfunction and ultrastructural defects, and normalized incidence of apoptosis. These findings (i) demonstrate that lack of Cyp-D is equivalent to its inhibition with CsA at curing the mouse dystrophic phenotype; (ii) establish a cause-effect relationship between Cyp-D-dependent PTP regulation and pathogenesis of the ColVI muscular dystrophy and (iii) validate Cyp-D and the PTP as pharmacological targets for the therapy of human ColVI myopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: The present study is to observe in vitro the proliferation ability of the muscle cells from permanent myopathy (PM) patients of nomokalaemic periodic paralysis (normKPP), which is caused by mutations of Met1592Val in the skeletal muscle voltage gated sodium channel (SCN4A) gene on chromosome 17q23.1. We also evaluate the possible effect of the foreign basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in preventing and curing PM. METHODS: The gastrocnemius muscle cells were taken from two male patients with PM of the same Chinese family with Met1592Val mutation of SCN4A, determined by gene screening. Four male patients suffering from the skeletal injury without PM were taken as control. All preparations were protogenerationally cultured in vitro. Proliferation of the cultured preparations was measured by MTT. Activities of the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), and protein content in these cells were also detected. The effects of bFGF with different doses (10 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, 40 ng/mL, 80 ng/mL, 120 ng/mL and 160 ng/mL) on the above mentioned parameters were also evaluated. RESULTS: Cells from both PM and control subjects were successfully cultured in vitro. The cultivation of the muscle cells from PM patients in vitro was not yet seen. Results indicated the obvious stimulation of bFGF on cell proliferation, activities of LDH and CK, protein synthesis, in a dose dependent manner. The optimal dose of bFGF was 120 ng/mL (P&lt;0.05), beyond which greater dose caused a less effect. The effect of bFGF on 160 ng /mL was stronger than that on 80 ng/mL, but there was no significant difference (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Myoblastic cells from patients with PM had a weaker ability of developing into the myotubules, thus they were unable to perform effective regeneration, which resulted in a progressive necrosis. The exogenous bFGF could promote the division and proliferation of the muscle cells in vitro. These results shield a light on bFGFos potential role in preventing and treating PM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Defects in the mitochondrial ATP-generating system are one of the most commonly inherited neurological disorders, but they remain without treatment. We have recently shown that modulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) level in skeletal muscle of a mitochondrial myopathy mouse model offers a therapeutic approach. Here we analyzed if endurance exercise, which is known to be associated with an increased PGC-1alpha level in muscle, offers the same beneficial effect. We subjected male and female mice that develop a severe mitochondrial myopathy due to a cytochrome-c oxidase deficiency at 3 mo of age to endurance exercise training and monitored phenotypical and metabolic changes. Sedentary myopathy and wild-type mice were used as controls. Exercise increased PGC-1alpha in muscle, resulting in increased mitochondrial biogenesis, and successfully stimulated residual respiratory capacity in muscle tissue. As a consequence, ATP levels were increased in exercised mice compared with sedentary myopathy animals, which resulted in a delayed onset of the myopathy and a prolonged lifespan of the exercised mice. As an added benefit, endurance exercise induced antioxidant enzymes. The overall protective effect of endurance exercise delayed the onset of the mitochondrial myopathy and increased life expectancy in the mouse model. Thus stimulating residual oxidative phosphorylation function in the affected muscle by inducing mitochondrial biogenesis through endurance exercise might offer a valuable therapeutic intervention for mitochondrial myopathy patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Two unrelated young women presented with similar dysmorphic features including severe retrognathia, beaked nose, narrow chest, sloping shoulders, and an acrogeric appearance of the hands and feet. Neither had any evidence of skeletal myopathy, but both developed progressive dilated cardiomyopathy, both experienced premature ovarian failure, and both were found to have the same heterozygous novel missense mutation c.176T>G in exon 1 of the LMNA gene, resulting in a leucine to arginine change at codon 59 (Leu59Arg). Mutations in the LMNA gene cause a variety of disorders including dilated cardiomyopathy, muscular dystrophy, familial lipodystrophy, progeria, atypical progeroid syndromes, and mandibuloacral dysplasia. Genotype-phenotype correlation has been reported for some of these conditions. Our patients are the only ones known to have the specific mutation Leu59Arg and also share a set of features not entirely consistent with any of the laminopathies previously described. A previously reported patient with an adjacent mutation (Ala57Pro) had "atypical Werner syndrome" with dilated cardiomyopathy, hypogonadism, and sloping shoulders. While each of these clinical features does occur in other laminopathy syndromes, these patients form a phenotypic cluster distinct from other laminopathies and clinically overlapping with Malouf syndrome. LMNA sequencing should be considered for patients presenting with dilated cardiomyopathy and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, including those previously diagnosed with Malouf syndrome.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The small heat shock protein alphaB-crystallin interacts with N2B-Us, a large unique sequence found in the N2B element of cardiac titin. Using single molecule force spectroscopy, we studied the effect of alphaB-crystallin on the N2B-Us and its flanking Ig-like domains. Ig domains from the proximal tandem Ig segment of titin were also studied. The effect of wild type alphaB-crystallin on the single molecule force-extension curve was determined as well as that of mutant alphaB-crystallins harboring the dilated cardiomyopathy missense mutation, R157H, or the desmin-related myopathy mutation, R120G. Results revealed that wild type alphaB-crystallin decreased the persistence length of the N2B-Us (from approximately 0.7 to approximately 0.2 nm) but did not alter its contour length. alphaB-crystallin also increased the unfolding force of the Ig domains that flank the N2B-Us (by 51 +/-3 piconewtons); the rate constant of unfolding at zero force was estimated to be approximately 17-fold lower in the presence of alphaB-crystallin (1.4 x 10(-4) s(-1) versus 2.4 x 10(-3) s(-1)). We also found that alphaB-crystallin increased the unfolding force of Ig domains from the proximal tandem Ig segment by 28 +/-6 piconewtons. The effects of alphaB-crystallin were attenuated by the R157H mutation (but were still significant) and were absent when using the R120G mutant. We conclude that alphaB-crystallin protects titin from damage by lowering the persistence length of the N2B-Us and reducing the Ig domain unfolding probability. Our finding that this effect is either attenuated (R157H) or lost (R120G) in disease causing alphaB-crystallin mutations suggests that the interaction between alphaB-crystallin and titin is important for normal heart function.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with inclusion body myopathy and Paget disease of bone is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the VCP (valosin-containing protein) gene. The disease is characterized neuropathologically by frontal and temporal lobar atrophy, neuron loss and gliosis, and ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U), which are distinct from those seen in other sporadic and familial FTLD-U entities. The major component of the ubiquitinated inclusions of FTLD with VCP mutation is TDP-43 (TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa). TDP-43 proteinopathy links sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, sporadic FTLD-U, and most familial forms of FTLD-U. Understanding the relationship between individual gene defects and pathologic TDP-43 will facilitate the characterization of the mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration. Using cell culture models, we have investigated the role of mutant VCP in intracellular trafficking, proteasomal function, and cell death and demonstrate that mutations in the VCP gene 1) alter localization of TDP-43 between the nucleus and cytosol, 2) decrease proteasome activity, 3) induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, 4) increase markers of apoptosis, and 5) impair cell viability. These results suggest that VCP mutation-induced neurodegeneration is mediated by several mechanisms.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In 2004, Anderson et al. reported a homozygous 2502 bp deletion including exon 55 of the nebulin gene in five Ashkenazi Jewish probands with nemaline myopathy. We determined the occurrence of this deletion in a world-wide series of 355 nemaline myopathy probands with no previously known mutation in other genes and found the mutation in 14 probands, two of whom represented families previously ascertained by Anderson et al. Two of the families were not of known Ashkenazi Jewish descent but they had the haplotype known to segregate with this mutation. In all but two of eight homozygous patients, the clinical picture was more severe than in typical nemaline myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) are known to cause autosomal-dominant inclusion-body myopathy with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). We report a novel missense mutation (G157R) in the N-terminal region of the VCP gene in a German family. Family members presented with mild to moderate proximal muscle weakness, Paget disease of bone, and signs of early cognitive decline, with onset in the fourth decade. Two family members also showed signs of early hearing impairment, which was confirmed to be sensorineural in one person, a symptom not yet described in the context of IBMPFD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Causative genes have been identified only in four types of lipid storage myopathies (LSMs): SLC22A5 for primary carnitine deficiency (PCD); ETFA, ETFB, and ETFDH for multiple acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenation deficiency (MADD); PNPLA2 for neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy (NLSDM); and ABHD5 for neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis. However, the frequency of these LSMs has not been determined. We found mutations in only 9 of 37 LSM patients (24%): 3 in SLC22A5; 4 in MADD-associated genes; and 2 in PNPLA2. This low frequency suggests the existence of other causative genes. Muscle coenzyme Q(10) levels were normal or only mildly reduced in two MADD patients, indicating that ETFDH mutations may not always be associated with CoQ(10) deficiency. The 2 patients with PNPLA2 mutations had progressive, non-episodic muscle disease with rimmed vacuoles. This suggests there is a different pathomechanism from other LSMs.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The transcriptome of ataxic muscles from alpha-tocopherol transfer protein deficient (ATTP-KO), 23-month old, mice was compared with that of their normal littermates. Genes encoding sarcolipin (sln) and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase (uchl1) were over-expressed (> or =10-fold) in ataxic muscles. SLN is a 3.2 kDa membrane protein that binds to sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, regulates Ca(+ +) transport and muscle relaxation-contraction cycles. UCHL1 is a 24.8 kDa member of proteosome proteins; it is over-expressed in myofibrillar myopathy and is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, six additional transcripts, three encoding thin-filament proteins and three encoding Ca(+ +) sensing proteins that participate in contraction-relaxation cycle, and eight transcripts that encode members of lysosomal proteins were also over-expressed in ataxic muscles. These observations suggest that chronic alpha-tocopherol (AT) deficiency activates critical genes of muscle contractility and protein degradation pathways, simultaneously. The magnitude of induction of sln and uchl1 was lower in asymptomatic, 8-month old, ATTP-KO mice and in 8-month old mice fed an AT-depleted diet. These studies suggest sln and uchl1 genes as novel targets of AT deficiency and may offer molecular correlates of well documented descriptions of neuromuscular dysfunctions in AT-deficient rodents. Since the neuromuscular deficits of ATTP-KO mice appear to be similar to those of patients with ATTP mutations, it is suggested that over-expression of sln and uchl1 may also contribute to AT-sensitive ataxia in humans.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mitsugumin 53 (MG53) is a muscle-specific RBCC/TRIM family member predominantly localized on small vesicles underneath the plasma membrane. Upon cell-surface lesion MG53 recruits the vesicles to the repair site in an oxidation-dependent manner and MG53-knockout mice develop progressive myopathy associated with defective membrane repair. In this report, we focus on MG53-knockout cardiomyocytes showing abnormal action potential profile and a reduced K+ current density. In cDNA expression experiments using cultured cells, KV2.1-mediated currents were remarkably increased by MG53 without affecting the total and cell-surface levels of channel expression. In imaging analysis MG53 seemed to facilitate the mobility of KV2.1-containing endocytic vesicles with acidic pH. However, similar effects on the current density and vesicular mobility were not observed in the putative dominant-negative form of MG53. Our data suggest that MG53 is involved in a constitutive cycle of certain cell-surface proteins between the plasma membrane and endosome-like vesicles in striated muscle, and also imply that the vesicular dynamics are essential for the quality control of KV2.1 in cardiomyocytes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The organization of sarcomeric structures during muscle development involves regulated multistep assembly pathways. The myosin assembly factor UNC-45 functions both as a molecular chaperone and as an Hsp90 co-chaperone for myosin throughout muscle thick-filament formation. Consequently, mutations in unc-45 result in paralyzed worms with severe myofibril disorganization in striated body wall muscles. Our data suggest that functional muscle formation in Caenorhabditis elegans is linked to ubiquitin-dependent UNC-45 turnover, regulated by the E3 enzymes UFD-2 and CHN-1 in cooperation with the ubiquitin-selective chaperone CDC-48 (also known as p97 in human). Missense mutations in the gene encoding p97 are known to cause a dominant, late-onset hereditary inclusion body myopathy. Remarkably, we identified a conserved role of CDC-48/p97 in the process of myofiber differentiation and maintenance, which appears to have important implications for understanding defects in muscle formation and maintenance during pathological conditions.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotubularin is a lipid phosphatase implicated in endosomal trafficking in vitro, but with an unknown function in vivo. Mutations in myotubularin cause myotubular myopathy, a devastating congenital myopathy with unclear pathogenesis and no current therapies. Myotubular myopathy was the first described of a growing list of conditions caused by mutations in proteins implicated in membrane trafficking. To advance the understanding of myotubularin function and disease pathogenesis, we have created a zebrafish model of myotubular myopathy using morpholino antisense technology. Zebrafish with reduced levels of myotubularin have significantly impaired motor function and obvious histopathologic changes in their muscle. These changes include abnormally shaped and positioned nuclei and myofiber hypotrophy. These findings are consistent with those observed in the human disease. We demonstrate for the first time that myotubularin functions to regulate PI3P levels in a vertebrate in vivo, and that homologous myotubularin-related proteins can functionally compensate for the loss of myotubularin. Finally, we identify abnormalities in the tubulo-reticular network in muscle from myotubularin zebrafish morphants and correlate these changes with abnormalities in T-tubule organization in biopsies from patients with myotubular myopathy. In all, we have generated a new model of myotubular myopathy and employed this model to uncover a novel function for myotubularin and a new pathomechanism for the human disease that may explain the weakness associated with the condition (defective excitation-contraction coupling). In addition, our findings of tubuloreticular abnormalities and defective excitation-contraction coupling mechanistically link myotubular myopathy with several other inherited muscle diseases, most notably those due to ryanodine receptor mutations. Based on our findings, we speculate that congenital myopathies, usually considered entities with similar clinical features but very disparate pathomechanisms, may at their root be disorders of calcium homeostasis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We recently identified the X-chromosomal four and a half LIM domain gene FHL1 as the causative gene for reducing body myopathy, a disorder characterized by progressive weakness and intracytoplasmic aggregates in muscle that exert reducing activity on menadione nitro-blue-tetrazolium (NBT). The mutations detected in FHL1 affected highly conserved zinc coordinating residues within the second LIM domain and lead to the formation of aggregates when transfected into cells. Our aim was to define the clinical and morphological phenotype of this myopathy and to assess the mutational spectrum of FHL1 mutations in reducing body myopathy in a larger cohort of patients. Patients were ascertained via the detection of reducing bodies in muscle biopsy sections stained with menadione-NBT followed by clinical, histological, ultrastructural and molecular genetic analysis. A total of 11 patients from nine families were included in this study, including seven sporadic patients with early childhood onset disease and four familial cases with later onset. Weakness in all patients was progressive, sometimes rapidly so. Respiratory failure was common and scoliosis and spinal rigidity were significant in some of the patients. Analysis of muscle biopsies confirmed the presence of aggregates of FHL1 positive material in all biopsies. In two patients in whom sequential biopsies were available the aggregate load in muscle sections appeared to increase over time. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that cytoplasmic bodies were regularly seen in conjunction with the reducing bodies. The mutations detected were exclusive to the second LIM domain of FHL1 and were found in both sporadic as well as familial cases of reducing body myopathy. Six of the nine mutations affected the crucial zinc coordinating residue histidine 123. All mutations in this residue were de novo and were associated with a severe clinical course, in particular in one male patient (H123Q). Mutations in the zinc coordinating residue cysteine 153 were associated with a milder phenotype and were seen in the familial cases in which the boys were still more severely affected compared to their mothers. We expect the mild end of the spectrum to significantly expand in the future. On the severe end of the spectrum we define reducing body myopathy as a progressive disease with early, but not necessarily congenital onset, distinguishing this condition from the classic essentially non-progressive congenital myopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Lysosomes filled with glycogen are a major pathologic feature of Pompe disease, a fatal myopathy and cardiomyopathy caused by a deficiency of the glycogen-degrading lysosomal enzyme, acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). To facilitate studies germane to this genetic disorder, we developed two in vitro Pompe models: myotubes derived from cultured primary myoblasts isolated from Pompe (GAA KO) mice, and myotubes derived from primary myoblasts of the same genotype that had been transduced with cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). This latter model is endowed with extended proliferative capacity. Both models showed extremely large alkalinized, glycogen-filled lysosomes as well as impaired trafficking to lysosomes. Although both Pompe tissue culture models were derived from fast muscles and were fast myosin positive, they strongly resemble slow fibers in terms of their pathologic phenotype and their response to therapy with recombinant human GAA (rhGAA). Autophagic buildup, a hallmark of Pompe disease in fast muscle fibers, was absent, but basal autophagy was functional. To evaluate substrate deprivation as a strategy to prevent the accumulation of lysosomal glycogen, we knocked down Atg7, a gene essential for autophagosome formation, via siRNA, but we observed no effect on the extent of glycogen accumulation, thus confirming our recent observation in autophagy-deficient Pompe mice [N. Raben, V. Hill, L. Shea, S. Takikita, R. Baum, N. Mizushima, E. Ralston, P. Plotz, Suppression of autophagy in skeletal muscle uncovers the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and their potential role in muscle damage in Pompe disease, Hum. Mol. Genet. 17 (2008) 3897-3908] that macroautophagy is not the major route of glycogen transport to lysosomes. The in vitro Pompe models should be useful in addressing fundamental questions regarding the pathway of glycogen to the lysosomes and testing panels of small molecules that could affect glycogen biosynthesis or speed delivery of the replacement enzyme to affected lysosomes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Quantitative and qualitative alterations of mitochondrial cardiolipin have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Barth syndrome, an X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy caused by a deficiency in tafazzin, an enzyme in the cardiolipin remodeling pathway. We have generated and previously reported a tafazzin-deficient Drosophila model of Barth syndrome that is characterized by low cardiolipin concentration, abnormal cardiolipin fatty acyl composition, abnormal mitochondria, and poor motor function. Here, we first show that tafazzin deficiency in Drosophila disrupts the final stage of spermatogenesis, spermatid individualization, and causes male sterility. This phenotype can be genetically suppressed by inactivation of the gene encoding a calcium-independent phospholipase A(2), iPLA2-VIA, which also prevents cardiolipin depletion/monolysocardiolipin accumulation, although in wild-type flies inactivation of the iPLA2-VIA does not affect the molecular composition of cardiolipin. Furthermore, we show that treatment of Barth syndrome patients' lymphoblasts in tissue culture with the iPLA(2) inhibitor, bromoenol lactone, partially restores their cardiolipin homeostasis. Taken together, these findings establish a causal role of cardiolipin deficiency in the pathogenesis of Barth syndrome and identify iPLA2-VIA as an important enzyme in cardiolipin deacylation, and as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H (LGMD2H) and sarcotubular myopathy are hereditary skeletal muscle disorders caused by mutations in TRIM32. We previously identified TRIM32 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that binds to myosin and ubiquitinates actin. To date four TRIM32 mutations have been linked to LGMD2H, all of which occur in the C-terminal NHL domains. Unexpectedly, a fifth mutation in the B-box of TRIM32 causes a completely different, multisystemic disorder, Bardet-Biedl syndrome type 11. It is not understood how allelic mutations in TRIM32 can create such diverse phenotypic outcomes. To generate a tool for elucidating the complex in vivo functions of TRIM32, we created the first murine Trim32 knock-out model (T32KO). Histological analysis of T32KO skeletal muscles revealed mild myopathic changes. Electron microscopy showed areas with Z-line streaming and a dilated sarcotubular system with vacuoles --the latter being a prominent feature of sarcotubular myopathy. Therefore, our model replicates phenotypes of LGMD2H and sarcotubular myopathy. The level of Trim32 expression in normal mouse brain exceeds that observed in skeletal muscle by more than 100 times, as we demonstrated by real-time PCR. Intriguingly, analysis of T32KO neural tissue revealed a decreased concentration of neurofilaments and a reduction in myelinated motoraxon diameters. The axonal changes suggest a shift toward a slower motor unit type. Not surprisingly, T32KO soleus muscle expressed an elevated type I slow myosin isotype with a concomitant reduction in the type II fast myosin. These data suggest that muscular dystrophy due to TRIM32 mutations involves both neurogenic and myogenic characteristics.</rdfs:comment>

We have identified in a woman and her daughter, a pLeu1793Pro mutation in MYH7. This mutation has already been reported to be associated with MSM presenting as neonatal hypotony. Our index case complained of proximal muscle weakness at age 30. Her daughter presented at birth with a cardiomyopathy without any skeletal muscle involvement.

<rdfs:comment>We report a male, preterm newborn infant with X-linked myotubular myopathy, the most severe type of the disease. He presented at birth with generalized hypotonia, difficulty in swallowing, and respiratory distress with frequent episodes of atelectasis. The infant had a long thin face, generalized hypotonia, and arachnodactyly. Diagnosis was based on fetal history, muscle histopathology, electron microscopy and a genetic study. A base pair change was detected in exon 11 of the MTM1 gene: c.1160C>A, which caused an amino acid change, p.S387Y. The father's gene was normal but the mother had the same mutation as her son and was thus a carrier.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACE2 is a protease homologous to BACE1 protein, an enzyme involved in the amyloid formation of Alzheimer disease (AD). However, despite the high homology between these two proteins, the biological role of BACE2 is still controversial, even though a few studies have suggested a pathogenetic role in sporadic inclusion-body myositis and hereditary inclusion-body myopathy, which are characterized by vacuolization of muscular fibers with intracellular deposits of proteins similar to those found in the brain of AD patients. Although BACE2 has also been identified in the pancreas, its function remains unknown and its specific localization in different pancreatic cell types has not been definitively ascertained. For these reasons, the authors have investigated the cellular and subcellular localization of BACE2 in normal rodent pancreases. BACE2 immunoreactivity was found in secretory granules of beta cells, co-stored with insulin and IAPP, while it was lacking in the other endocrine and exocrine cell types. The presence of BACE2 in secretory granules of beta cells suggests that it may play a role in diabetes-associated amyloidogenesis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>CXCL10 is a 10 kDa protein, which is categorized functionally as a Th1-chemokine. It binds to the receptor CXCR3 and regulates immune responses through the activation and recruitment of leukocytes, such as, T cells, eosinophils, and monocytes. Recent reports have shown that serum and/or tissue expressions of CXCL10 are increased in various autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus rythematosus (SLE), Sjogren syndrome (SS), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM). Moreover, CXCL10 and CXCR3 may have important roles in leukocyte homing to inflamed tissues and in the perpetuation of inflammation, and therefore, tissue damage. Our recent study shows that CXCL10 also has a pathogenic role in bone destruction via receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) induction in inflamed synovial tissue of RA. In addition to its chemotactic effect, CXCL10 may have pleiotropic functions. Further research on the function of this chemokine and interactions between CXCL10 and other cytokines and chemokines may provide therapeutic targets in various autoimmune diseases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Myofibrillar myopathies (MFMs) are morphologically distinct but genetically heterogeneous muscular dystrophies in which disintegration of Z disks and then of myofibrils is followed by ectopic accumulation of multiple proteins. Cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, and dominant inheritance are frequent associated features. Mutations in alphaB-crystallin, desmin, myotilin, Zasp, or filamin-C can cause MFMs and were detected in 32 of 85 patients of the Mayo MFM cohort. Bag3, another Z-disk-associated protein, has antiapoptotic properties, and its targeted deletion in mice causes fulminant myopathy with early lethality. We therefore searched for mutations in BAG3 in 53 unrelated MFM patients. METHODS: We searched for mutations in BAG3 by direct sequencing. We analyzed structural changes in muscle by histochemistry, immunocytochemistry, and electron microscopy, examined mobility of the mutant Bag3 by nondenaturing electrophoresis, and searched for abnormal aggregation of the mutant protein in COS-7 (SV-40 transformed monkey kidney fibroblast-7) cells. RESULTS: We identified a heterozygous p.Pro209Leu mutation in three patients. All presented in childhood, had progressive limb and axial muscle weakness, and experienced development of cardiomyopathy and severe respiratory insufficiency in their teens; two had rigid spines, and one a peripheral neuropathy. Electron microscopy showed disintegration of Z disks, extensive accumulation of granular debris and larger inclusions, and apoptosis of 8% of the nuclei. On nondenaturing electrophoresis of muscle extracts, the Bag3 complex migrated faster in patient than control extracts, and expression of FLAG-labeled mutant and wild-type Bag3 in COS cells showed abnormal aggregation of the mutant protein. INTERPRETATION: We conclude mutation in Bag3 defines a novel severe autosomal dominant childhood muscular dystrophy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the gene encoding the phosphoinositide phosphatase myotubularin 1 protein (MTM1) are usually associated with severe neonatal X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM). However, mutations in MTM1 have also been recognized as the underlying cause of "atypical" forms of XLMTM in newborn boys, female infants, female manifesting carriers and adult men. We reviewed systematically the biopsies of a cohort of patients with an unclassified form of centronuclear myopathy (CNM) and identified four patients presenting a peculiar histological alteration in some muscle fibers that resembled a necklace ("necklace fibers"). We analyzed further the clinical and morphological features and performed a screening of the genes involved in CNM. Muscle biopsies in all four patients demonstrated 4-20% of fibers with internalized nuclei aligned in a basophilic ring (necklace) at 3 microm beneath the sarcolemma. Ultrastructurally, such necklaces consisted of myofibrils of smaller diameter, in oblique orientation, surrounded by mitochondria, sarcoplasmic reticulum and glycogen granules. In the four patients (three women and one man), myopathy developed in early childhood but was slowly progressive. All had mutations in the MTM1 gene. Two mutations have previously been reported (p.E404K and p.R241Q), while two are novel; a c.205_206delinsAACT frameshift change in exon 4 and a c.1234A>G mutation in exon 11 leading to an abnormal splicing and the deletion of nine amino acids in the catalytic domain of MTM1. Necklace fibers were seen neither in DNM2- or BIN1-related CNM nor in males with classical XLMTM. The presence of necklace fibers is useful as a marker to direct genetic analysis to MTM1 in CNM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Life-threatening cardiac and respiratory complications are common in LMNA-related myopathies and early diagnosis is important for optimal patient care. Lamin A/C related congenital muscular dystrophy (L-CMD) is often caused by de novo mutation in LMNA, affecting a single child in a family. Germinal mosaicism is a rarer variant that can lead to two children inheriting the same new heterozygous mutation from a clinically unaffected parent. Both patterns mimic autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance and the possibility of de novo L-CMD may be forgotten since most causes of congenital muscular dystrophy follow AR inheritance. To illustrate the challenge of diagnosing L-CMD, we present a consanguineous family in which two children have early onset LMNA-related myopathy likely due to paternal germinal mosaicism. This emphasises that germinal mosaicism (and de novo mutations) for LMNA can arise in any family and direct gene sequencing is required to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Regulators of skeletal muscle mass are of interest, given the morbidity and mortality of muscle atrophy and myopathy. Four-and-a-half LIM protein 1 (FHL1) is mutated in several human myopathies, including reducing-body myopathy (RBM). The normal function of FHL1 in muscle and how it causes myopathy remains unknown. We find that FHL1 transgenic expression in mouse skeletal muscle promotes hypertrophy and an oxidative fiber-type switch, leading to increased whole-body strength and fatigue resistance. Additionally, FHL1 overexpression enhances myoblast fusion, resulting in hypertrophic myotubes in C2C12 cells, (a phenotype rescued by calcineurin inhibition). In FHL1-RBM C2C12 cells, there are no hypertrophic myotubes. FHL1 binds with the calcineurin-regulated transcription factor NFATc1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 1), enhancing NFATc1 transcriptional activity. Mutant RBM-FHL1 forms aggregate bodies in C2C12 cells, sequestering NFATc1 and resulting in reduced NFAT nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. NFATc1 also colocalizes with mutant FHL1 to reducing bodies in RBM-afflicted skeletal muscle. Therefore, via NFATc1 signaling regulation, FHL1 appears to modulate muscle mass and strength enhancement.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the alpha7 integrin gene cause congenital myopathy characterized by delayed developmental milestones and impaired mobility. Previous studies in dystrophic mice suggest the alpha7beta1 integrin may be critical for muscle repair. To investigate the role that alpha7beta1 integrin plays in muscle regeneration, cardiotoxin was used to induce damage in the tibialis anterior muscle of alpha7 integrin-null mice. Unlike wild-type muscle, which responded rapidly to repair damaged myofibers, alpha7 integrin-deficient muscle exhibited defective regeneration. Analysis of Pax7 and MyoD expression revealed a profound delay in satellite cell activation after cardiotoxin treatment in alpha7 integrin-null animals when compared with wild type. We have recently demonstrated that the muscle of alpha7 integrin-null mice exhibits reduced laminin-alpha2 expression. To test the hypothesis that loss of laminin contributes to the defective muscle regeneration phenotype observed in alpha7 integrin-null mice, mouse laminin-111 (alpha1, beta1, gamma1) protein was injected into the tibialis anterior muscle 3 days before cardiotoxin-induced injury. The injected laminin-111 protein infiltrated the entire muscle and restored myogenic repair and muscle regeneration in alpha7 integrin-null muscle to wild-type levels. Our data demonstrate a critical role for a laminin-rich microenvironment in muscle repair and suggest laminin-111 protein may serve as an unexpected and novel therapeutic agent for patients with congenital myopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Destruction of skeletal muscle extracellular matrix is an important pathological consequence of many diseases involving muscle wasting. However, the underlying mechanisms leading to extracellular matrix breakdown in skeletal muscle tissues remain unknown. Using a microarray approach, we investigated the effect of tumor necrosis factor-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), a recently identified muscle-wasting cytokine, on the expression of extracellular proteases in skeletal muscle. Among several other matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), we found that the expression of MMP-9, a type IV collagenase, was drastically increased in myotubes in response to TWEAK. The level of MMP-9 was also higher in myofibers of TWEAK transgenic mice. TWEAK increased the activation of both classical and alternative nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathways. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity blocked the TWEAK-induced production of MMP-9 in myotubes. TWEAK also increased the activation of AP-1, and its inhibition attenuated the TWEAK-induced MMP-9 production. Overexpression of a kinase-dead mutant of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase or IkappaB kinase-beta but not IkappaB kinase-alpha significantly inhibited the TWEAK-induced activation of MMP-9 promoter. The activation of MMP-9 also involved upstream recruitment of TRAF2 and cIAP2 proteins. TWEAK increased the activity of ERK1/2, JNK1, and p38 MAPK. However, the inhibition of only p38 MAPK blocked the TWEAK-induced expression of MMP-9 in myotubes. Furthermore the loss of body and skeletal muscle weights, inflammation, fiber necrosis, and degradation of basement membrane around muscle fibers were significantly attenuated in Mmp9 knock-out mice on chronic administration of TWEAK protein. The study unveils a novel mechanism of skeletal muscle tissue destruction in pathological conditions.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in SEPN1 result in a spectrum of early-onset muscle disorders referred to as SEPN1-related myopathy. The SEPN1 gene encodes selenoprotein N (SelN), which contains the amino acid selenocysteine (Sec). Incorporation of Sec occurs due to redefinition of a UGA codon during translation. Efficient insertion requires a Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) in the 3'UTR and, for at least a subset of selenoprotein genes, a Sec redefinition element (SRE) located adjacent to the UGA codon. We report the effect of three novel and one previously reported point mutation in the SelN SRE element on Sec insertion efficiency. Notably, the previously reported mutation c.1397G>A (p.R466Q), which weakens the secondary structure of the SRE element, reduces Sec insertion efficiency and SelN RNA levels. Muscle from patients with this mutation have negligible levels of SelN protein. This data highlights the importance of the SRE element during SelN expression and illustrates a novel molecular mechanism by which point mutations may lead to SEPN1-related myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report a cluster of patients from a Karaite Jew community with a movement disorder suggestive of Huntington disease (HD), in some cases associated with repeat lengths below the edge of 36 CAG repeats. The study describes the clinical and genetic features of four patients who were followed over several years. Patients belonged to an inbred family in whom progressive chorea, manifesting predominantly with dystonia and cerebellar features, developed during middle age. Although severe psychiatric symptoms ultimately developed in two of the four patients, cognitive function remained reasonably well preserved in all of them even after several disease years. Moderate cognitive deficits were limited to the visuomotor organization and abstract thinking subtests in three of the four patients. Qualitative brain imaging showed atrophy of brain predominantly involving cortex and cerebellum. Genetic testing revealed a variable mutation penetrance among family members, some affected members showing an upper allele size ranging from 34 to 49, whereas others remained unaffected despite the presence of the full mutation beyond 40 CAG repeats. Co-morbidity with recessive hereditary inclusion body myopathy was found in two subjects from one family. Although the main diagnosis of HD remains to be confirmed by further neuropathological studies, these cases may suggest that HD could manifest with as few as 34 CAG repeats, in some geographic areas, the disease phenotype most probably being influenced by additional, as yet unidentified, genes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Danon disease is an X-linked dominant multisystem disorder that includes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with skeletal myopathy, and results from mutations in the gene encoding the lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2). To date, over 20 different mutations in LAMP2 have been identified. Three members of a family, a male proband (18 years old) and 2 sisters (15 and 20 years old) were studied. Their mother had been diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy at the age of 39 years, and died from advanced heart failure at the age of 43 years. The proband developed marked concentric hypertrophy at the age of 5 years and DNA analyses revealed a novel hemizygous frameshift mutation (c.573delA) in exon 5. The 2 affected sisters were also heterozygous for the same mutation. Functional analyses of this novel LAMP2 mutation are mandatory.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myofibrillar myopathies (MFMs) are an expanding and increasingly recognized group of neuromuscular disorders caused by mutations in DES, CRYAB, MYOT, and ZASP. The latest gene to be associated with MFM was FLNC; a p.W2710X mutation in the 24th immunoglobulin-like repeat of filamin C was shown to be the cause of a distinct type of MFM in several German families. We studied an International cohort of 46 patients from 39 families with clinically and myopathologically confirmed MFM, in which DES, CRYAB, MYOT, and ZASP mutations have been excluded. In patients from an unrelated family a 12-nucleotide deletion (c.2997_3008del) in FLNC resulting in a predicted in-frame four-residue deletion (p.Val930_Thr933del) in the seventh repeat of filamin C was identified. Both affected family members, mother and daughter, but not unrelated control individuals, carried the p.Val930_Thr933del mutation. The mutation is transcribed and, based on myopathological features and immunoblot analysis, it leads to an accumulation of dysfunctional filamin C in the myocytes. The study results suggest that the novel p.Val930_Thr933del mutation in filamin C is the cause of MFM but also indicate that filamin C mutations are a comparatively rare cause of MFM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dynamic membrane repair and remodelling is an elemental process that maintains cell integrity and mediates efficient cellular function. Here we report that MG53, a muscle-specific tripartite motif family protein (TRIM72), is a component of the sarcolemmal membrane-repair machinery. MG53 interacts with phosphatidylserine to associate with intracellular vesicles that traffic to and fuse with sarcolemmal membranes. Mice null for MG53 show progressive myopathy and reduced exercise capability, associated with defective membrane-repair capacity. Injury of the sarcolemmal membrane leads to entry of the extracellular oxidative environment and MG53 oligomerization, resulting in recruitment of MG53-containing vesicles to the injury site. After vesicle translocation, entry of extracellular Ca(2+) facilitates vesicle fusion to reseal the membrane. Our data indicate that intracellular vesicle translocation and Ca(2+)-dependent membrane fusion are distinct steps involved in the repair of membrane damage and that MG53 may initiate the assembly of the membrane repair machinery in an oxidation-dependent manner.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotilinopathies are a group of muscle disorders caused by mutations in the MYOT gene. It was first described in two families suffering from limb girdle muscle dystrophy type 1 (LGMD 1A), and later identified in a subset of dominant or sporadic patients suffering from myofibrillar myopathy, as well as in a family with spheroid body myopathy. Disease phenotypes associated with MYOT mutations are clinically heterogeneous and include pure LGMD forms as well as late-onset distal myopathies. We report here on a 53-year-old male suffering from a unique clinical profile characterized by generalized symmetrical increase in muscle bulk leading to a Herculean appearance. Muscle weakness and stiffness in the lower extremities were the patient's main complaints. Muscle MRI showed extensive fatty infiltration in the thigh and leg muscles and a muscle biopsy showed a myofibrillar myopathy with prominent protein aggregates. Gene sequencing revealed a Ser55Phe missense mutation in the myotilin gene. The mutation was identified in his older brother, who presented a mild hypertrophic appearance and had a myopathic pattern in EMG, despite not presenting any of the complaints of the proband and having normal muscle strength. This finding, and his deceased father and paternal aunt's similar gait disorders, suggest that this is in fact a new autosomal dominant kindred. The present observations further expand the spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with mutations in the myotilin gene.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the intermediate filament (IF) protein desmin cause severe forms of myofibrillar myopathy characterized by partial aggregation of the extrasarcomeric desmin cytoskeleton and structural disorganization of myofibrils. In contrast to prior expectations, we showed that some of the known disease-causing mutations, such as DesA360P, DesQ389P and DesD399Y, are assembly-competent and do allow formation of bona fide IFs in vitro and in vivo. We also previously demonstrated that atomic force microscopy can be employed to measure the tensile properties of single desmin IFs. Using the same approach on filaments formed by the aforementioned mutant desmins, we now observed two different nanomechanical behaviors: DesA360P exhibited tensile properties similar to that of wild-type desmin IFs, whereas DesQ389P and DesD399Y exhibited local variations in their tensile properties along the filament length. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that DesQ389P and DesD399Y may cause muscle disease by altering the specific biophysical properties of the desmin filaments, thereby compromising both its mechanosensing and mechanotransduction ability.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We have previously reported a group of patients with congenital onset weakness associated with a deficiency of members of the syntrophin-alpha-dystrobrevin subcomplex and have demonstrated that loss of syntrophin and dystrobrevin from the sarcolemma of skeletal muscle can also be associated with denervation. Here, we have further studied four individuals from a consanguineous Egyptian family with a lethal congenital myopathy inherited in an autosomal-recessive fashion and characterized by a secondary loss of beta2-syntrophin and alpha-dystrobrevin from the muscle sarcolemma, central nervous system involvement, and fetal akinesia. We performed homozygosity mapping and candidate gene analysis and identified a mutation that segregates with disease within CNTN1, the gene encoding for the neural immunoglobulin family adhesion molecule, contactin-1. Contactin-1 transcripts were markedly decreased on gene-expression arrays of muscle from affected family members compared to controls. We demonstrate that contactin-1 is expressed at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in mice and man in addition to the previously documented expression in the central and peripheral nervous system. In patients with secondary dystroglycanopathies, we show that contactin-1 is abnormally localized to the sarcolemma instead of exclusively at the NMJ. The cntn1 null mouse presents with ataxia, progressive muscle weakness, and postnatal lethality, similar to the affected members in this family. We propose that loss of contactin-1 from the NMJ impairs communication or adhesion between nerve and muscle resulting in the severe myopathic phenotype. This disorder is part of the continuum in the clinical spectrum of congenital myopathies and congenital myasthenic syndromes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Desmin interacts with nebulin establishing a direct link between the intermediate filament network and sarcomeres at the Z-discs. Here, we examined a desmin mutation, E245D, that is located within the coil IB (nebulin-binding) region of desmin and that has been reported to cause human cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle atrophy. We show that the coil IB region of desmin binds to C-terminal nebulin (modules 160-164) with high affinity, whereas binding of this desmin region containing the E245D mutation appears to enhance its interaction with nebulin in solid-phase binding assays. Expression of the desmin-E245D mutant in myocytes displaces endogenous desmin and C-terminal nebulin from the Z-discs with a concomitant increase in the formation of intracellular aggregates, reminiscent of a major histological hallmark of desmin-related myopathies. Actin filament architecture was strikingly perturbed in myocytes expressing the desmin-E245D mutant because most sarcomeres contained elongated or shorter actin filaments. Our findings reveal a novel role for desmin intermediate filaments in modulating actin filament lengths and organization. Collectively, these data suggest that the desmin E245D mutation interferes with the ability of nebulin to precisely regulate thin filament lengths, providing new insights into the potential molecular consequences of expression of certain disease-associated desmin mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the skeletal muscle actin gene, ACTA1 are responsible for up to 20% of congenital myopathies with a variety of pathologies that includes nemaline myopathy, intranuclear rod myopathy, actin myopathy and congenital fibre type disproportion. In their review of 2003, Sparrow et al. considered how these actin mutations might affect muscle function at the molecular level and thus cause the disease. Since then several laboratories have taken up the challenge of investigating genotype-phenotype relationships experimentally. The objective of this review is to assess the current state of our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of skeletal myopathies and the prospects for future therapies based on this knowledge. Thirty congenital myopathy-causing ACTA1 mutations have been studied using a range of biochemical and in vitro approaches. They showed diverse molecular defects, and there is no obvious pattern seen in mutations resulting in the same histopathology.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A subgroup of neutral lipid storage disease has been recently associated with myopathy (NLSDM) and attributed to mutations in the gene (PNPLA2) encoding an adipose triglyceride lipase involved in the degradation of intracellular triglycerides. Five NLSDM patients have been described thus far and we reported three additional patients. A 44-year old Iranian woman and two Italian brothers, aged 40 and 35, presented with exercise intolerance and proximal limb weakness, elevated CK levels, and Jordan's anomaly. Muscle biopsies showed marked neutral lipid accumulation in all patients. The 10 exons and the intron-exon junctions of the PNPLA2 gene were sequenced. Two novel homozygous mutations in exon 5 of PNPLA2 gene were found (c.695delT and c.542delAC). Both mutations resulted in frameshifts leading to premature stop codons (p.L255X and p.I212X, respectively). These mutations predict a truncated PNPLA2 protein lacking the C-terminal hydrophobic domain. These findings indicate that NLSDM is rare, but genetically heterogeneous.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in C-terminal titin cause autosomal dominant tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD) as reported previously. Samples from 25 new families and 25 sporadic new distal myopathy cases were screened for titin mutations. Three novel mutations were discovered in two families from Spain and two families from France. Two mutations, g.292998delT and g.293376delA lead to frameshift and premature stop codons in the second last and the last titin gene (TTN) exons, Mex5 and Mex6, respectively. The third was a nonsense mutation g.293379C>T (p.Q33396X) in Mex6. Patients with the upstream Mex5 mutation showed a more severe phenotype with earlier onset implying a genotype-phenotype correlation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Genetic mutations that affect mitochondrial function often cause skeletal muscle dysfunction. Here, we used mice with skeletal-muscle-specific disruption of the nuclear gene for mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) to study whether changes in cellular Ca(2+) handling is part of the mechanism of muscle dysfunction in mitochondrial myopathy. Force measurements were combined with measurements of cytosolic Ca(2+), mitochondrial Ca(2+) and membrane potential and reactive oxygen species in intact, adult muscle fibres. The results show reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) storage capacity in Tfam KO muscles due to a decreased expression of calsequestrin-1. This resulted in decreased SR Ca(2+) release during contraction and hence lower force production in Tfam KO than in control muscles. Additionally, there were no signs of oxidative stress in Tfam KO cells, whereas they displayed increased mitochondrial [Ca(2+)] during repeated contractions. Mitochondrial [Ca(2+)] remained elevated long after the end of stimulation in muscle cells from terminally ill Tfam KO mice, and the increase was smaller in the presence of the cyclophilin D-binding inhibitor cyclosporin A. The mitochondrial membrane potential in Tfam KO cells did not decrease during repeated contractions. In conclusion, we suggest that the observed changes in Ca(2+) handling are adaptive responses with long-term detrimental effects. Reduced SR Ca(2+) release likely decreases ATP expenditure, but it also induces muscle weakness. Increased [Ca(2+)](mit) will stimulate mitochondrial metabolism acutely but may also trigger cell damage.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>UNLABELLED: We report a Spanish family affected from a late onset, hand-involved and autosomal dominant distal myopathy associated to Caveolin-3 mutation. Signs of muscle hyperexcitability and hyperckemia were observed in the youngest relatives but not motor symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Neurological examination was performed in all members of the family. Muscle biopsy sample was taken from the proband and DNA genomics was amplified for the two exons of Cav-3 by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in all the affected members and in three asymptomatic relatives. RESULTS: Signs of muscle hyperexcitability and hyperckemia were observed in the affected members from early ages. Cav-3 expression was greatly reduced in the sarcolemma of the proband's muscle. Genetic studies revealed a G --> A transition at nucleotide position 80 in exon 1 of the Cav-3 gene (c.80G>A), generating a Arg --> Gln change at codon 27 (p.R27Q) of the amino acid chain in heterozygous state, while no mutation was found in unaffected members. CONCLUSIONS: Signs of muscle hyperexcitability and hyperckemia at early ages may predict the development of a late onset autosomal dominant hand-involved myopathy associated to Cav-3 mutation in the family reported herein.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report on clinicopathological and whole body MRI analyses of the index patient of a large nonconsanguineous German-Ukraine family with homozygous and heterozygous AGL gene mutations at position p.W1327X (c.3980G > A). There are only limited reports on this phenotype with a homozygous genotype. The index patient, a 49-year-old woman presented with hepatomegaly, cardiomyopathy and moderate progressive proximal limb myopathy. Skeletal muscle showed severe vacuolar myopathy with storage of PAS-positive non-membrane-limited glycogen. An increase in glycogen content and completely decrease of debranching enzyme activity was measured in erythrocytes. Mutational analysis of the AGL gene showed a homozygous p.W1327X mutation. In the family, two brothers had been affected by severe infantile onset hepatomegaly and died within their first years of life by fatal liver cirrhosis. Furthermore, another sister severely affected by hepatomegaly, cardiomyopathy and proximal skeletal myopathy died at age 33. Three younger heterozygous sisters and a brother noticed exercise-induced myalgia and weakness since their teens. In sum, a homozygous p.W1327X mutation leads to a severe generalized glycogenosis types 3a and 3b within the same family. Even heterozygous p.W1327X mutation carriers may present with mild non-progressive neuromuscular symptoms, such as exercise-induced myalgia and fatigue.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlinopathies belong to the heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive muscular dystrophies. Mutations in the gene encoding dysferlin (DYSF) lead to distinct phenotypes, mainly Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy (MM). Here, we analysed the mutational data from the largest cohort described to date, a cohort of 134 patients, included based on clinical suspicion of primary dysferlinopathy and/or dysferlin protein deficiency identified on muscle biopsy samples. Data were compiled from 38 patients previously screened for mutations in our laboratory (Nguyen, et al., 2005; Nguyen, et al., 2007), and 96 supplementary patients screened for DYSF mutations using genomic DHPLC analysis, and subsequent sequencing of detected variants, in a routine diagnostic setting. In 89 (66%) out of 134 patients, molecular analysis identified two disease causing mutations, confirming the diagnosis of primary Dysferlinopathy on a genetic basis. Furthermore, one mutation was identified in 30 patients, without identification of a second deleterious allele. We are currently developing complementary analysis for patients in whom only one or no disease-causing allele could be identified using the genomic screening procedure. Altogether, 64 novel mutations have been identified in this cohort, which corresponds to approximately 25% of all DYSF mutations reported to date. The mutational spectrum of this cohort significantly shows a higher proportion of nonsense mutations, but a lower proportion of deleterious missense changes as compared to previous series.

<rdfs:comment>Skeletal muscle nNOSmu (neuronal nitric oxide synthase mu) localizes to the sarcolemma through interaction with the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein (DAG) complex, where it synthesizes nitric oxide (NO). Disruption of the DAG complex occurs in dystrophinopathies and sarcoglycanopathies, two genetically distinct classes of muscular dystrophy characterized by progressive loss of muscle mass, muscle weakness and increased fatigability. DAG complex instability leads to mislocalization and downregulation of nNOSmu; but this is thought to play a minor role in disease pathogenesis. This view persists without knowledge of the role of nNOS in skeletal muscle contractile function in vivo and has influenced gene therapy approaches to dystrophinopathy, the majority of which do not restore sarcolemmal nNOSmu. We address this knowledge gap by evaluating skeletal muscle function in nNOS knockout (KN1) mice using an in situ approach, in which the muscle is maintained in its normal physiological environment. nNOS-deficiency caused reductions in skeletal muscle bulk and maximum tetanic force production in male mice only. Furthermore, nNOS-deficient muscles from both male and female mice exhibited increased susceptibility to contraction-induced fatigue. These data suggest that aberrant nNOSmu signaling can negatively impact three important clinical features of dystrophinopathies and sarcoglycanopathies: maintenance of muscle bulk, force generation and fatigability. Our study suggests that restoration of sarcolemmal nNOSmu expression in dystrophic muscles may be more important than previously appreciated and that it should be a feature of any fully effective gene therapy-based intervention.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical and molecular features of a new phenotype related to collagen VI myopathies. METHODS: We examined two patients belonging to a consanguineous family affected by myosclerosis myopathy, screened for mutations of collagen VI genes, and performed a detailed biochemical and morphologic analysis of the muscle biopsy and cultured fibroblasts. RESULTS: The patients had a novel homozygous nonsense COL6A2 mutation (Q819X); the mutated messenger RNA escaped nonsense-mediated decay and was translated into a truncated alpha2(VI) chain, lacking the sole C2 domain. The truncated chain associated with the other two chains, giving rise to secreted collagen VI. Monomers containing the truncated chain were assembled into dimers, but tetramers were almost absent; secreted collagen VI was quantitatively reduced and structurally abnormal in cultured fibroblasts. Mutated collagen did not correctly localize in the basement membrane of muscle fibers and was absent in the capillary wall. Ultrastructural analysis of muscle showed an unusual combination of basement membrane thickening and duplication, and increased number of pericytes. CONCLUSIONS: This familial case has the characteristic features of myosclerosis myopathy and carries a homozygous COL6A2 mutation responsible for a peculiar pattern of collagen VI defects. Our study demonstrates that myosclerosis myopathy should be considered a collagen VI disorder allelic to Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy and Bethlem myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the dysferlin gene cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy. Dysferlin-deficient cells show abnormalities in vesicular traffic and membrane repair although onset of symptoms is not commonly seen until the late teenage years and is often associated with subacute onset and marked muscle inflammation. To identify molecular networks specific to dysferlin-deficient muscle that might explain disease pathogenesis, muscle mRNA profiles from 10 mutation-positive LGMD2B/MM patients were compared with a disease control [LGMD2I; (n = 9)], and normal muscle samples (n = 11). Query of inflammatory pathways suggested LGMD2B-specific increases in co-stimulatory signaling between dendritic cells and T cells (CD86, CD28, and CTLA4), associated with localized expression of both versican and tenascin. LGMD2B muscle also showed an increase in vesicular trafficking pathway proteins not normally observed in muscle (synaptotagmin-like protein Slp2a/SYTL2 and the small GTPase Rab27A). We propose that Rab27A/Slp2a expression in LGMD2B muscle provides a compensatory vesicular trafficking pathway that is able to repair membrane damage in the absence of dysferlin. However, this same pathway may release endocytotic vesicle contents, resulting in an inflammatory microenvironment. As dysferlin deficiency has been shown to enhance phagocytosis by macrophages, together with our findings of abnormal myofiber endocytosis pathways and dendritic-T cell activation markers, these results suggest a model of immune and inflammatory network over-stimulation that may explain the subacute inflammatory presentation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Based on extensive preclinical data, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) has been proposed to be a viable drug target for a wide variety of disease states, ranging from diabetes to bipolar disorder. Since these new drugs, which will be more powerful GSK-3 inhibitors than lithium, may potentially be given to women of childbearing potential, and since it has controversially been suggested that lithium therapy might be linked to congenital cardiac defects, we asked whether GSK-3 family members are required for normal heart development in mice. We report that terminal cardiomyocyte differentiation was substantially blunted in Gsk3b(-/-) embryoid bodies. While GSK-3alpha-deficient mice were born without a cardiac phenotype, no live-born Gsk3b(-/-) pups were recovered. The Gsk3b(-/-) embryos had a double outlet RV, ventricular septal defects, and hypertrophic myopathy, with near obliteration of the ventricular cavities. The hypertrophic myopathy was caused by cardiomyocyte hyperproliferation without hypertrophy and was associated with increased expression and nuclear localization of three regulators of proliferation - GATA4, cyclin D1, and c-Myc. These studies, which we believe are the first in mammals to examine the role of GSK-3alpha and GSK-3beta in the heart using loss-of-function approaches, implicate GSK-3beta as a central regulator of embryonic cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation, as well as of outflow tract development. Although controversy over the teratogenic effects of lithium remains, our studies suggest that caution should be exercised in the use of newer, more potent drugs targeting GSK-3 in women of childbearing age.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: The collagen VI muscular dystrophies, Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, form a continuum of clinical phenotypes. Glycine mutations in the triple helix have been identified in both Bethlem and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, but it is not known why they cause these different phenotypes. METHODS: We studied eight new patients who presented with a spectrum of clinical severity, screened the three collagen VI messenger RNA for mutations, and examined collagen VI biosynthesis and the assembly pathway. RESULTS: All eight patients had heterozygous glycine mutations toward the N-terminal end of the triple helix. The mutations produced two assembly phenotypes. In the first patient group, collagen VI dimers accumulated in the cell but not the medium, microfibril formation in the medium was moderately reduced, and the amount of collagen VI in the extracellular matrix was not significantly altered. The second group had more severe assembly defects: some secreted collagen VI tetramers were not disulfide bonded, microfibril formation in the medium was severely compromised, and collagen VI in the extracellular matrix was reduced. INTERPRETATION: These data indicate that collagen VI glycine mutations impair the assembly pathway in different ways and disease severity correlates with the assembly abnormality. In mildly affected patients, normal amounts of collagen VI were deposited in the fibroblast matrix, whereas in patients with moderate-to-severe disability, assembly defects led to a reduced collagen VI fibroblast matrix. This study thus provides an explanation for how different glycine mutations produce a spectrum of clinical severity.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To examine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the protein tyrosine phosphatase N22 gene (PTPN22) and to study the relationship between PTPN22 and the HLA region in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs). METHODS: PTPN22 SNPs were assessed in a large, cross-sectional, case-control study from the UK involving patients with adult or juvenile IIM, comprising patients with polymyositis (PM) (n=114), dermatomyositis (DM) (n=102), myositis associated with another connective tissue disease (myositis-CTD overlap syndrome) (n=64), or juvenile DM (n=101), in comparison with 748 control subjects. Seventeen PTPN22 SNPs were genotyped using the Sequenom MassArray iPLEX platform. Serotyping for myositis-specific/myositis-associated autoantibodies (MSAs/MAAs) was performed by radioimmunoprecipitation. RESULTS: A significant association was noted between the R620W variant (rs2476601) and IIM (corrected P [Pcorr]=0.0009 versus controls), and specifically with the clinical subgroup of PM (Pcorr=0.003 versus controls). A weaker association was noted with juvenile DM (Pcorr=0.009 versus controls). No significant associations were noted after stratification by serologic subgroups. The association with the R620W variant was independent of alleles forming the HLA 8.1 haplotype. No other PTPN22 SNPs were associated with IIM. The PTPN22 haplotype containing the R620W T allele was the only haplotype significantly associated with IIM. CONCLUSION: The R620W variant is a significant risk factor for IIM, independent of the HLA 8.1 haplotype. Unlike that in the HLA region, risk is not increased in individuals possessing MSAs/MAAs. These results are further evidence that the PTPN22 gene confers autoimmune susceptibility.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Recurrent episodes of life-threatening myoglobinuria in childhood are caused by inborn errors of glycogenolysis, mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation. Nonetheless, approximately half of the patients do not suffer from a defect in any of these pathways. Using homozygosity mapping, we identified six deleterious mutations in the LPIN1 gene in patients who presented at 2-7 years of age with recurrent, massive rhabdomyolysis. The LPIN1 gene encodes the muscle-specific phosphatidic acid phosphatase, a key enzyme in triglyceride and membrane phospholipid biosynthesis. Of six individuals who developed statin-induced myopathy, one was a carrier for Glu769Gly, a pathogenic mutation in the LPIN1 gene. Analysis of phospholipid content disclosed accumulation of phosphatidic acid and lysophospholipids in muscle tissue of the more severe genotype. Mutations in the LPIN1 gene cause recurrent rhabdomyolysis in childhood, and a carrier state may predispose for statin-induced myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Centronuclear myopathy (CNM) is an inherited neuromuscular disorder characterised by clinical features of a congenital myopathy and centrally placed nuclei on muscle biopsy.The incidence of X-linked myotubular myopathy is estimated at 2/100000 male births but epidemiological data for other forms are not currently available.The clinical picture is highly variable. The X-linked form usually gives rise to a severe phenotype in males presenting at birth with marked weakness and hypotonia, external ophthalmoplegia and respiratory failure. Signs of antenatal onset comprise reduced foetal movements, polyhydramnios and thinning of the ribs on chest radiographs; birth asphyxia may be the present. Affected infants are often macrosomic, with length above the 90th centile and large head circumference. Testes are frequently undescended. Both autosomal-recessive (AR) and autosomal-dominant (AD) forms differ from the X-linked form regarding age at onset, severity, clinical characteristics and prognosis. In general, AD forms have a later onset and milder course than the X-linked form, and the AR form is intermediate in both respects.Mutations in the myotubularin (MTM1) gene on chromosome Xq28 have been identified in the majority of patients with the X-linked recessive form, whilst AD and AR forms have been associated with mutations in the dynamin 2 (DNM2) gene on chromosome 19p13.2 and the amphiphysin 2 (BIN1) gene on chromosome 2q14, respectively. Single cases with features of CNM have been associated with mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) and the hJUMPY (MTMR14) genes.Diagnosis is based on typical histopathological findings on muscle biopsy in combination with suggestive clinical features; muscle magnetic resonance imaging may complement clinical assessment and inform genetic testing in cases with equivocal features. Genetic counselling should be offered to all patients and families in whom a diagnosis of CNM has been made.The main differential diagnoses include congenital myotonic dystrophy and other conditions with severe neonatal hypotonia.Management of CNM is mainly supportive, based on a multidisciplinary approach. Whereas the X-linked form due to MTM1 mutations is often fatal in infancy, dominant forms due to DNM2 mutations and some cases of the recessive BIN1-related form appear to be associated with an overall more favourable prognosis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Adenine nucleotide translocase (Ant) is the most abundant protein on the mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM) primarily involved in ADP/ATP exchange. Ant also possesses a discrete membrane uncoupling activity. Specific mis-sense mutations in the human Ant1 cause autosomal dominant Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (adPEO), mitochondrial myopathy and cardiomyopathy, which are commonly manifested by fractional mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions. It is currently thought that the pathogenic mutations alter substrate preference (e.g. ATP versus ADP) thereby dominantly disturbing adenine nucleotide homeostasis in mitochondria. This may interfere with mtDNA replication, consequently affecting mtDNA stability and oxidative phosphorylation. Here, we showed that the adPEO-type A128P, A106D and M114P mutations in the yeast Aac2p share the following common dominant phenotypes: electron transport chain damage, intolerance to moderate over-expression, synthetic lethality with low Deltapsi(m) conditions, hypersensitivity to the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and mtDNA instability. More interestingly, the aac2(A137D) allele mimicking ant1(A123D) in mitochondrial myopathy and cardiomyopathy exhibits similar dominant phenotypes. Because Aac2(A137D) is known to completely lack transport activity, it is strongly argued that the dominant mitochondrial damages are not caused by aberrant nucleotide transport. The four pathogenic mutations occur in a structurally dynamic gating region on the cytosolic side. We provided direct evidence that the mutant alleles uncouple mitochondrial respiration. The pathogenic mutations likely enhance the intrinsic proton-conducting activity of Ant, which excessively uncouples the MIM thereby affecting energy transduction and mitochondrial biogenesis. mtDNA disintegration is a phenotype co-lateral to mitochondrial damages. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of the Ant1-induced diseases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>INTRODUCTION: McArdle disease (glycogenosis type V) is an autosomal recessive metabolic myopathy. Defect in glycogen breakdown is due to mutations of the gene for myophosphorylase (PYGM). Among patients of the department, we searched for correlations between disease phenotype, biochemistry analysis of muscle samples and PYGM genotype. METHODS: We included five patients whose muscle biopsy showed deposits of glycogen and negative histochemical staining for myophosphorylase. RESULTS: All patients exhibited exercise intolerance and high serum CK levels (mean 4400). Two of them had an acute renal insufficiency caused by rhabdomyolysis. One patient developed moderate late-onset muscle weakness of the proximal part of upper limbs. Muscle glycogen concentration was high (three times the normal). Myophosphorylase activity was undetectable in four muscle samples out of five. Two patients were homozygous and two other heterozygous for the R50X mutation of PYGM. The other one had a novel missense mutation S814N. Patients homozygous for R50X mutation had higher CK levels (8080 versus 1457, p=0.046), but disease severity and muscle glycogen concentrations were equivalent. CONCLUSIONS: Our patients had typical clinical and laboratory features of McArdle disease. Diagnosis was suggested by exercise intolerance with high CK levels. The R50X mutation was the most common (60% of the mutated alleles). We found no relationship between clinical severity, PYGM genotype and biochemistry analysis of muscle samples.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the mitochondrial cardiolipin (CL) transacylase, tafazzin (Taz1p), result in the X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy, Barth syndrome (BTHS). The mitochondria of BTHS patients exhibit variable respiratory defects and abnormal cristae ultrastructure. The biochemical basis for these observations is unknown. In the absence of its target phospholipid, CL, a very large Taz1p complex is missing, whereas several discrete smaller complexes are still observed. None of the identified Taz1p complexes represents Taz1p homodimers. Instead, yeast Taz1p physically assembles in several protein complexes of distinct size and composition. The ATP synthase and AAC2, both required for oxidative phosphorylation, are identified in separate stable Taz1p complexes. In the absence of CL, each interaction is still detected albeit in reduced abundance compared with when CL is present. Taz1p is not necessary for the normal expression of AAC2 or ATP synthase subunits or assembly of their respective complexes. In contrast, the largest Taz1p complex requires assembled ATP synthase and CL. Mitochondria in Delta taz1 yeast, similar to ATP synthase oligomer mutants, exhibit altered cristae morphology even though ATP synthase oligomer formation is unaffected. Thus, the Taz1p interactome defined here provides novel insight into the variable respiratory defects and morphological abnormalities observed in mitochondria of BTHS patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC)/osteonectin is expressed in different tissues during remodeling and repair, suggesting a function in regeneration. Several gene expression studies indicated that SPARC was expressed in response to muscle damage. Studies on myoblasts further indicated a function of SPARC in skeletal muscle. We therefore found it of interest to study SPARC expression in human skeletal muscle during development and in biopsies from Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy and congenital muscular dystrophy, congenital myopathy, inclusion body myositis, and polymyositis patients to analyze SPARC expression in a selected range of inherited and idiopathic muscle wasting diseases. SPARC-positive cells were observed both in fetal and neonatal muscle, and in addition, fetal myofibers were observed to express SPARC at the age of 15-16 weeks. SPARC protein was detected in the majority of analyzed muscle biopsies (23 of 24), mainly in mononuclear cells of which few were pax7 positive. Myotubes and regenerating myofibers also expressed SPARC. The expression-degree seemed to reflect the severity of the lesion. In accordance with these in vivo findings, primary human-derived satellite cells were found to express SPARC both during proliferation and differentiation in vitro. In conclusion, this study shows SPARC expression both during muscle development and in regenerating muscle. The expression is detected both in satellite cells/myoblasts and in myotubes and muscle fibers, indicating a role for SPARC in the skeletal muscle compartment.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Neuromuscular disorders with defects in the mitochondrial ATP-generating system affect a large number of children and adults worldwide, but remain without treatment. We used a mouse model of mitochondrial myopathy, caused by a cytochrome c oxidase deficiency, to evaluate the effect of induced mitochondrial biogenesis on the course of the disease. Mitochondrial biogenesis was induced either by transgenic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) coactivator alpha (PGC-1alpha) in skeletal muscle or by administration of bezafibrate, a PPAR panagonist. Both strategies successfully stimulated residual respiratory capacity in muscle tissue. Mitochondrial proliferation resulted in an enhanced OXPHOS capacity per muscle mass. As a consequence, ATP levels were conserved resulting in a delayed onset of the myopathy and a markedly prolonged life span. Thus, induction of mitochondrial biogenesis through pharmacological or metabolic modulation of the PPAR/PGC-1alpha pathway promises to be an effective therapeutic approach for mitochondrial disorders.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Collagen VI is a survival factor for skeletal muscle produced by endomysial cells and localized in connective tissue around muscle fibers. Mutations of its genes (COL6A1, COL6A2 and COL6A3) cause two muscular disorders, Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich disease. Expression of Collagen VI is highly dynamic during development, suggesting that developmental and homeostatic cues of the muscle microenvironment are relevant to confine its expression in this tissue. In face of the large body of work highlighting the relevance for human diseases of the adhesion of muscle cells with their surrounding extracellular matrix, remarkably little is known on how myogenic cells control gene expression in the connective tissue cells that produce such matrix. By expressing promoter-lacZ constructs in transgenic mice, we identify a Col6a1 gene enhancer region that is necessary for activation of transcription in connective tissue cells associated with skeletal muscle. By means of a lacZ transgenic mouse line crossed in metD/D mutant background, in which muscles of limb buds fail to form, we provide evidence that the presence of cells of the myogenic lineage is needed for enhancer activation in mesenchymal cells. Accordingly, lack of myogenic cells in limb buds of metD/D mice reduces Collagen VI deposition in connective tissue. The Col6a1 enhancer characterized here is conserved in mammals and may be relevant in some cases of heritable diseases of Collagen VI.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Myosin is a molecular motor and the essential part of the thick filament of striated muscle. The expression of myosin heavy-chain (MyHC) isoforms is developmentally regulated. The embryonic isoform encoded from MYH3 (OMIM *160720) is expressed during fetal life. Recently, mutations in MYH3 were demonstrated to be associated with congenital joint contractures, that is, Freeman-Sheldon and Sheldon-Hall syndromes, which are both distal arthrogryposis syndromes. Mutations in other MyHC isoforms cause myopathy. It is unknown whether MYH3 mutations cause myopathy because muscle tissue has not been studied. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether novel MYH3 mutations are associated with distal arthrogryposis and to demonstrate myopathic changes in muscle biopsy specimens from 4 patients with distal arthrogryposis and MYH3 mutations. DESIGN: In a cohort of patients with distal arthrogryposis, we analyzed the entire coding sequence of MYH3. Muscle biopsy specimens were obtained, and in addition to morphologic analysis, the expression of MyHC isoforms was investigated at the protein and transcript levels. RESULTS: We identified patients from 3 families with novel MYH3 mutations. These mutations affect developmentally conserved residues that are located in different regions of the adenosine triphosphate-binding pocket of the MyHC head. The embryonic (MYH3) isoform was not detected in any of the muscle biopsy samples, indicating a normal developmental downregulation of MYH3 in these patients. However, morphologic analysis of muscle biopsy specimens from the 4 patients revealed mild and variable myopathic features and a pathologic upregulation of the fetal MyHC isoform (MYH8) in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: Distal arthrogryposis associated with MYH3 mutations is secondary to myosin myopathy, and postnatal muscle manifestations are variable.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with statin therapy results in substantial reductions in cardiovascular events, and larger reductions in cholesterol may produce larger benefits. In rare cases, myopathy occurs in association with statin therapy, especially when the statins are administered at higher doses and with certain other medications. METHODS: We carried out a genomewide association study using approximately 300,000 markers (and additional fine-mapping) in 85 subjects with definite or incipient myopathy and 90 controls, all of whom were taking 80 mg of simvastatin daily as part of a trial involving 12,000 participants. Replication was tested in a trial of 40 mg of simvastatin daily involving 20,000 participants. RESULTS: The genomewide scan yielded a single strong association of myopathy with the rs4363657 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located within SLCO1B1 on chromosome 12 (P=4x10(-9)). SLCO1B1 encodes the organic anion-transporting polypeptide OATP1B1, which has been shown to regulate the hepatic uptake of statins. The noncoding rs4363657 SNP was in nearly complete linkage disequilibrium with the nonsynonymous rs4149056 SNP (r(2)=0.97), which has been linked to statin metabolism. The prevalence of the rs4149056 C allele in the population was 15%. The odds ratio for myopathy was 4.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6 to 7.7) per copy of the C allele, and 16.9 (95% CI, 4.7 to 61.1) in CC as compared with TT homozygotes. More than 60% of these myopathy cases could be attributed to the C variant. The association of rs4149056 with myopathy was replicated in the trial of 40 mg of simvastatin daily, which also showed an association between rs4149056 and the cholesterol-lowering effects of simvastatin. No SNPs in any other region were clearly associated with myopathy. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified common variants in SLCO1B1 that are strongly associated with an increased risk of statin-induced myopathy. Genotyping these variants may help to achieve the benefits of statin therapy more safely and effectively. (Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN74348595.)</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV), also called hereditary inclusion body myopathy (hIBM), is characterized clinically by weakness and atrophy that initially involves the distal muscles and pathologically by the presence of rimmed vacuoles (RVs) or intracellular protein deposits in myofibers. It is caused by mutations in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene that is important in sialic acid synthesis. Recently, we generated a mouse model (Gne(-/-)hGNED176VTg) that exhibits muscle weakness and pathological changes similar to DMRV patients. To gain better understanding of the pathomechanism of DMRV, we determined temporal changes in the overall motor performance of this model mouse for DMRV in correlation with the structure and function of isolated skeletal muscles and muscle pathology. These DMRV mice exhibited muscle weakness, decreased whole muscle mass and cross-sectional area (CSA), and reduced contractile power in an age-related manner. Single-fiber CSA further supported the finding of muscle atrophy that involved both type I and type II fibers. These results suggest that atrophy is highly correlated with reduced production of force at young age, both in vivo and ex vivo, thereby implicating the important role of atrophy in the pathomechanism of DMRV. In older age, and particularly in gastrocnemius muscles, RVs and intracellular inclusions were seen in type IIA fibers, further aggravating reduction of force and specific increase in twitch-tetanus ratio.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: The Fragile X Mental retardation-Related 1 (FXR1) gene belongs to the fragile X related family, that also includes the Fragile X Mental Retardation (FMR1) gene involved in fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation. While the absence of FMRP impairs cognitive functions, inactivation of FXR1 has been reported to have drastic effects in mouse and xenopus myogenesis. Seven alternatively spliced FXR1 mRNA variants have been identified, three of them being muscle specific. Interestingly, they encode FXR1P isoforms displaying selective RNA binding properties. METHODS AND RESULTS: Since facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an inherited myopathy characterised by altered splicing of mRNAs encoding muscle specific proteins, we have studied the splicing pattern of FXR1 mRNA in myoblasts and myotubes of FSHD patients. We show here that FSHD myoblasts display an abnormal pattern of expression of FXR1P isoforms. Moreover, we provide evidence that this altered pattern of expression is due to a specific reduced stability of muscle specific FXR1 mRNA variants, leading to a reduced expression of FXR1P muscle specific isoforms. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the molecular basis of FSHD not only involves splicing alterations, as previously proposed, but may also involve a deregulation of mRNA stability. In addition, since FXR1P is an RNA binding protein likely to regulate the metabolism of muscle specific mRNAs during myogenesis, its altered expression in FSHD myoblasts may contribute to the physiopathology of this disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Therapeutic use of certain peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha agonists (fibrates) for the treatment of dyslipidemia has infrequently been associated with the untoward side effect of myopathy. With interest in PPAR-delta as a therapeutic target, this study assessed whether a PPAR-delta agonist induced similar hepatic and skeletal muscle alterations as noted with some fibrates. PPAR-alpha null (KO) and corresponding wild-type (WT) mice were administered toxicological dosages of a potent PPAR-delta agonist tool ligand (GW0742; which also has weak PPAR-alpha agonist activity) or a potent PPAR-alpha agonist (WY-14,643) for 10 days. Increases in liver weights and clinical chemistry indicators of skeletal muscle damage and/or liver injury were more pronounced in WT mice compared with KO mice administered the PPAR-delta agonist. Likewise, the incidence and severity of skeletal myopathy were greater in WT mice given GW0742 compared with KO mice. Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical analyses revealed significant peroxisome proliferation in muscle and liver of WT mice treated with each agonist; however, KO animals showed little or no evidence of hepatic and muscle peroxisome proliferation. PMP-70 protein expression in liver was consistent with these results. The hepatomegaly, hepatic and skeletal muscle peroxisome proliferation, and skeletal myopathy induced by this PPAR-delta ligand was predominantly mediated by its cross-activation of PPAR-alpha, though PPAR-delta agonism contributed slightly to these effects.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report on two unrelated patients clinically presenting with late-onset progressive limb girdle weakness; cardiomyopathy was seen in one patient. Muscle biopsy revealed a necrotic myopathy with numerous rimmed vacuoles, ultrastructurally typical paired-helical filaments, and reduced immunohistochemical staining for alpha-dystroglycan. Quadriceps sparing hereditary inclusion body myopathy due to mutations in GNE gene, and OPMD due to PABPN1 mutations were excluded, genetically. We detected a homozygous mutation of the FKRP gene (826C>A) in both patients. Mutations of FKRP have been reported in congenital muscular dystrophies, LGMD2I, cardiomyopathy and hyperCKemia, but not in myopathies with vacuoles and paired-helical filaments. Therefore, our findings further extend the morphological variability of muscular dystrophies due to FKRP mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous mitochondrial disorder with variable clinical symptoms. Here, from the sequencing of the entire mitochondrial genome, we report a Korean MELAS family harboring two homoplasmic missense mutations, which were reported 9957T>C (Phe251Leu) transition mutation in the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 (COX3) gene and a novel 13849A>C (Asn505His) transversion mutation in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) gene. Neither of these mutations was found in 205 normal controls. Both mutations were identified from the proband and his mother, but not his father. The patients showed cataract symptom in addition to MELAS phenotype. We believe that the 9957T>C mutation is pathogenic, however, the 13849A>C mutation is of unclear significance. It is likely that the 13849A>C mutation might function as the secondary mutation which increase the expressivity of overlapping phenotypes of MELAS and cataract. This study also demonstrates the importance of full sequencing of mtDNA for the molecular genetic understanding of mitochondrial disorders.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in POLG gene are responsible for a wide spectrum of clinical disorders with altered mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity, including mtDNA multiple deletions and depletion. Sensory ataxic neuropathy with ophthalmoparesis (SANDO) caused by mutations in POLG gene, fulfilling the clinical triad of sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria and/or dysphagia and ophthalmoparesis, has described in a few reports. Here we described five cases of adult onset autosomal recessive sensory ataxic neuropathy with ophthalmoplegia. All patients had ataxia, neuropathy, myopathy, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). The muscle pathology revealed ragged-red and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) negative fibers in three patients. However, deficiencies in the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme complexes were not detected in any of the patients' muscle samples. Multiple deletions of mtDNA were detected in blood and muscle specimens but mtDNA depletion was not found. Due to these diagnostic difficulties, POLG-related syndromes are definitively diagnosed based on the presence of deleterious mutations in the POLG gene.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the caveolin-3 gene (CAV3) can lead to a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes. Phenotypes that have so far been associated with primary caveolin-3 deficiency include limb girdle muscular dystrophy, rippling muscle disease, distal myopathy and hyperCKaemia. This is the first report describing the clinical, pathological and genetic features of patients with caveolinopathy from the UK. Ten patients (six families) were identified via the National Commissioning Group (NCG) service for patients with limb girdle muscle dystrophy in Newcastle. Myalgia was the most prominent symptom in our cohort of patients and for 50% it was the reason for referral. Muscle weakness was only found in 60% of the patients, whereas rippling muscle movement was present in 80%. One of the patients reported episodes of myoglobinuria and another one episodes of hypoglycaemia. Five different mutations were identified, two of which were novel and three that had previously been described. Caveolinopathy needs to be considered as a differential diagnosis in a range of clinical situations, including in patients who do not have any weakness. Indeed, rippling muscles are a more frequent symptom than weakness, and can be detected in childhood. Presentation with myalgia is common and management of it as well as of myoglobinuria and hypoglycaemia may have a major impact on the patients' quality of life.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late onset hereditary myopathy of autosomal dominant transmission characterised by ptosis, dysphagia and limb weakness. The disease is caused by short heterozygous expansions of a (GCN)(10) triplet located in the first exon of the PABPN1 gene at chromosome 14q11.1. Most affected individuals from North America and Europe carry a mutant (GCN)(13) allele. Although evidence for a founder mutation effect has been shown in several populations with OPMD, analysis of large groups of patients from different ethnic backgrounds will help to identify the relative contribution of each allele to the disease and a possible genotype-phenotype correlation. METHODS: 22 unrelated patients with OPMD from Mexico, a previously uncharacterised population, were clinically and molecularly analysed. Detailed ophthalmological and clinical examinations were performed in each proband and molecular analysis of the PABPN1 gene was carried out by PCR amplification and allele-specific cloning/sequencing. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to PABPN1 were determined in each individual and in a number of affected first-degree relatives. RESULTS: 15 subjects (68%) carried a mutant (GCN)(15) or (GCG)(11)(GCA)(3)(GCG) PABPN1 allele; the remaining 7 (32%) exhibited an abnormal (GCN)(13) or (GCG)(9)(GCA)(3)(GCG) allele. Analysis of two SNPs linked to PABPN1 strongly suggests that both expanded alleles originate from two independent founder effects. In addition, in this particular population the (GCN)(15) allele was associated with an earlier onset of the disease (mean 46.5 years) compared with the (GCN)(13) allele (mean 54.7 years). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that OPMD in the Mexican population is mostly due to (GCG)(11) or (GCG)(9) PABPN1 expanded alleles arising from two independent founder effect mutations. These findings add to the definition of the genetic features of the disease and to the establishment of a probable genotype-phenotype correlation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Multiple deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are associated with different mitochondrial disorders inherited as autosomal dominant and recessive traits. Causative mutations have been found in five genes, mainly involved in mtDNA replication and stability. They include POLG1, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of mtDNA polymerase (pol gamma), POLG2 encoding its accessory subunit, ANT1 coding the adenine nucleotide translocator and PEO1 which codes for Twinkle, the mitochondrial helicase. Finally OPA1 missense mutations are involved in phenotypes presenting optic atrophy as a major feature.To define the relative contribution of POLG1, POLG2, ANT1 and PEO1 genes to the mtDNA multiple deletion syndromes, we analysed them in a cohort of 67 probands showing accumulation of multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle. The patients were predominantly affected with a mitochondrial myopathy with or without progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). Genetic analysis revealed that 1) PEO1 has a major role in determining familial PEO, since it accounts for 26.8% of familial cases, followed by ANT1 (14.6%) and POLG1 (9.8%); 2) no mutations in any of the known genes were found in 53.7% of probands of this series. Six novel missense mutations contributing to the mutational load of PEO1 gene (p.R334P, p.W315S, p. S426N, p.W474S, p.F478I, p.E479K) were associated with an adult onset PEO phenotype.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) is a rare neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in GNE, the key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of sialic acid. While the mechanism leading from GNE mutations to the HIBM phenotype is not yet understood, we searched for proteins potentially interacting with GNE, which could give some insights about novel putative biological functions of GNE in muscle. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)-Biosensor based assay to search for potential GNE interactors in anion exchanged fractions of human skeletal muscle primary culture cell lysate. Analysis of the positive fractions by in vitro binding assay revealed alpha-actinin 1 as a potential interactor of GNE. The direct interaction of the two proteins was assessed in vitro by SPR-Biosensor based kinetics analysis and in a cellular environment by a co-immunoprecipitation assay in GNE overexpressing 293T cells. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry on stretched mouse muscle suggest that both GNE and alpha-actinin 1 localize to an overlapping but not identical region of the myofibrillar apparatus centered on the Z line. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The interaction of GNE with alpha-actinin 1 might point to its involvement in alpha-actinin mediated processes. In addition these studies illustrate for the first time the expression of the non-muscle form of alpha-actinin, alpha-actinin 1, in mature skeletal muscle tissue, opening novel avenues for its specific function in the sarcomere. Although no significant difference could be detected in the binding kinetics of alpha-actinin 1 with either wild type or mutant GNE in our SPR biosensor based analysis, further investigation is needed to determine whether and how the interaction of GNE with alpha-actinin 1 in skeletal muscle is relevant to the putative muscle-specific function of alpha-actinin 1, and to the muscle-restricted pathology of HIBM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To describe a new entity of congenital muscular dystrophies caused by de novo LMNA mutations. METHODS: Fifteen patients presenting with a myopathy of onset in the first year of life were subjected to neurological and genetic evaluation. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed for all patients. RESULTS: The 15 patients presented with muscle weakness in the first year of life, and all had de novo heterozygous LMNA mutations. Three of them had severe early-onset disease, no motor development, and the rest experienced development of a "dropped head" syndrome phenotype. Despite variable severity, there was a consistent clinical pattern. Patients typically presented with selective axial weakness and wasting of the cervicoaxial muscles. Limb involvement was predominantly proximal in upper extremities and distal in lower extremities. Talipes feet and a rigid spine with thoracic lordosis developed early. Proximal contractures appeared later, most often in lower limbs, sparing the elbows. Ten children required ventilatory support, three continuously through tracheotomy. Cardiac arrhythmias were observed in four of the oldest patients but were symptomatic only in one. Creatine kinase levels were mild to moderately increased. Muscle biopsies showed dystrophic changes in nine children and nonspecific myopathic changes in the remaining. Markedly atrophic fibers were common, most often type 1, and a few patients showed positive inflammatory markers. INTERPRETATION: The LMNA mutations identified appear to correlate with a relatively severe phenotype. Our results further broaden the spectrum of laminopathies and define a new disease entity that we suggest is best classified as a congenital muscular dystrophy (LMNA-related congenital muscular dystrophy, or L-CMD).</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the POLG gene have emerged as one of the most common causes of inherited mitochondrial disease in children and adults. They are responsible for a heterogeneous group of at least 6 major phenotypes of neurodegenerative disease that include: 1) childhood Myocerebrohepatopathy Spectrum disorders (MCHS), 2) Alpers syndrome, 3) Ataxia Neuropathy Spectrum (ANS) disorders, 4) Myoclonus Epilepsy Myopathy Sensory Ataxia (MEMSA), 5) autosomal recessive Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (arPEO), and 6) autosomal dominant Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (adPEO). Due to the clinical heterogeneity, time-dependent evolution of symptoms, overlapping phenotypes, and inconsistencies in muscle pathology findings, definitive diagnosis relies on the molecular finding of deleterious mutations. We sequenced the exons and flanking intron region from approximately 350 patients displaying a phenotype consistent with POLG related mitochondrial disease and found informative mutations in 61 (17%). Two mutant alleles were identified in 31 unrelated index patients with autosomal recessive POLG-related disorders. Among them, 20 (67%) had Alpers syndrome, 4 (13%) had arPEO, and 3 (10%) had ANS. In addition, 30 patients carrying one altered POLG allele were found. A total of 25 novel alterations were identified, including 6 null mutations. We describe the predicted structural/functional and clinical importance of the previously unreported missense variants and discuss their likelihood of being pathogenic. In conclusion, sequence analysis allows the identification of mutations responsible for POLG-related disorders and, in most of the autosomal recessive cases where two mutant alleles are found in trans, finding deleterious mutations can provide an unequivocal diagnosis of the disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the protein dysferlin, a member of the ferlin family, lead to limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and Myoshi myopathy. The ferlins are large proteins characterised by multiple C2 domains and a single C-terminal membrane-spanning helix. However, there is sequence conservation in some of the ferlin family in regions outside the C2 domains. In one annotation of the domain structure of these proteins, an unusual internal duplication event has been noted where a putative domain is inserted in between the N- and C-terminal parts of a homologous domain. This domain is known as the DysF domain. Here, we present the solution structure of the inner DysF domain of the dysferlin paralogue myoferlin, which has a unique fold held together by stacking of arginine and tryptophans, mutations that lead to clinical disease in dysferlin.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>It is now well established that stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is the calcium sensor of endoplasmic reticulum stores required to activate store-operated calcium entry (SOC) channels at the surface of non-excitable cells. However, little is known about STIM1 in excitable cells, such as striated muscle, where the complement of calcium regulatory molecules is rather disparate from that of non-excitable cells. Here, we show that STIM1 is expressed in both myotubes and adult skeletal muscle. Myotubes lacking functional STIM1 fail to show SOC and fatigue rapidly. Moreover, mice lacking functional STIM1 die perinatally from a skeletal myopathy. In addition, STIM1 haploinsufficiency confers a contractile defect only under conditions where rapid refilling of stores would be needed. These findings provide insight into the role of STIM1 in skeletal muscle and suggest that STIM1 has a universal role as an ER/SR calcium sensor in both excitable and non-excitable cells.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Obscurin, a giant modular muscle protein implicated in G-protein and protein-kinase signalling, can localize to both sarcomeric Z-disks and M-bands. Interaction of obscurin with the Z-disk is mediated by Z-disk titin. Here, we unravel the molecular basis for the unusual localization of obscurin, a Z-disk-associated protein, to the M-band, where its invertebrate analogue UNC-89 is also localized. The first three domains of the N-terminus of obscurin bind to the most C-terminal domain of M-band titin, as well as to the M-band protein myomesin. Both proteins also interact with the N-terminal domains of obscurin-like 1 (Obsl1), a small homologue of obscurin. Downregulation of myomesin by siRNA interference disrupts obscurin-M-band integration in neonatal cardiomyocytes, as does overexpression of the binding sites on either myomesin, obscurin or Obsl1. Furthermore, all titin mutations that have been linked to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2J (LGMD2J) or Salih myopathy weaken or abrogate titin-obscurin and titin-Obsl1 binding, and lead to obscurin mislocalization, suggesting that interference with the interaction of these proteins might be of pathogenic relevance for human disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in human alpha-skeletal actin have been implicated in causing congenital nemaline myopathy, a disease characterized histopathologically by nemaline bodies in skeletal muscle and manifested in the patient as skeletal muscle weakness. Here we investigate the functional effects of three severe nemaline myopathy mutations (V43F, A138P, and R183G) in human alpha-skeletal actin. Wild-type and mutant actins were expressed and purified from the baculovirus/insect cell expression system. The mutations are located in different subdomains of actin; Val-43 is located in a flexible loop of subdomain 2, Ala-138 is near a hydrophobic cleft in the "hinge" region between subdomains 1 and 3, and Arg-183 is near the nucleotide-binding site. None of the three mutations affected the folding of the actin monomer, the velocity at which skeletal myosin moves actin in an in vitro motility assay, or the relative average isometric force supported by F-actin. Defects in fundamental actomyosin interactions are, therefore, unlikely to account for the muscle weakness observed in affected patients. There were, however, significant changes observed in the polymerization kinetics of V43F and A138P and in the rate of nucleotide release for V43F. No detectable defect was found for R183G. If these subtle changes in polymerization observed in vitro are amplified in the context of the sarcomere, it could in principle be one of the primary insults that triggers the development of nemaline myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathies (NM) are a rare group of muscle disorders, but represent one of the most common forms of congenital myopathy. The clinical picture ranges from severe muscular hypotonia often leading to death during childhood to mild forms with long life expectancy. Diagnosis is made by muscle biopsy showing characteristic sarcoplasmic and sometimes intranuclear rod bodies. So far, disease-associated mutations have been detected in six genes without any simple correlation between genotype and phenotype or histological findings. We report a patient with a phenotype typical of congenital onset nemaline myopathy and exclusively intranuclear rods. Mutation analysis revealed a new heterozygous missense mutation in exon 3 of the ACTA1 gene (Q139H). Molecular modelling predicts that substitution of Q139 for H139 alters the amino acid side chains and hydrogen bonding which may alter the nucleotide binding cleft by adding 'bulk' to the mutated molecule. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrates that mutant actin Q139H is expressed at approximately half the level of wild-type actin in the patient's muscle. We speculate that these alterations, although not directly affecting the nuclear export signal, negatively interfere with the nuclear export of the mutated protein and thereby cause retention of mutant actin and intranuclear rod formation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Post-transcriptional modifications at the first (wobble) position of the tRNA anticodon participate in precise decoding of the genetic code. To decode codons that end in a purine (R) (i.e. NNR), tRNAs frequently utilize 5-methyluridine derivatives (xm(5)U) at the wobble position. However, the functional properties of the C5-substituents of xm(5)U in codon recognition remain elusive. We previously found that mitochondrial tRNAs(Leu(UUR)) with pathogenic point mutations isolated from MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) patients lacked the 5-taurinomethyluridine (taum(5)U) modification and caused a decoding defect. Here, we constructed Escherichia coli tRNAs(Leu(UUR)) with or without xm(5)U modifications at the wobble position and measured their decoding activities in an in vitro translation as well as by A-site tRNA binding. In addition, the decoding properties of tRNA(Arg) lacking mnm(5)U modification in a knock-out strain of the modifying enzyme (DeltamnmE) were examined by pulse labeling using reporter constructs with consecutive AGR codons. Our results demonstrate that the xm(5)U modification plays a critical role in decoding NNG codons by stabilizing U.G pairing at the wobble position. Crystal structures of an anticodon stem-loop containing taum(5)U interacting with a UUA or UUG codon at the ribosomal A-site revealed that the taum(5)U.G base pair does not have classical U.G wobble geometry. These structures provide help to explain how the taum(5)U modification enables efficient decoding of UUG codons.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>CONTEXT: The molecular mechanisms by which triglycerides in lipid droplets (LDs) are synthesized, stored, and degraded need to be elucidated. OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to report siblings with neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy (NLSDM) with a novel mutation of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and determine whether the C-terminal part of ATGL containing the hydrophobic region plays a role in the interaction with LDs. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood leukocytes were obtained from NLSDM patients. In vitro experiments were performed with fibroblasts and COS7 cells. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Transfection studies were used to assess the effects of various recombinant ATGL proteins on lipase activities and lipid contents. Fluorescence microscopy were used for determination of intracellular distribution of ATGL proteins. RESULTS: The direct sequence of ATGL cDNA reveals that a patient is a homozygote for the 4-bp deletion, leading to a premature stop codon and causes the lack of the C terminus of the protein including the hydrophobic domain. Overexpressed control ATGL in NLSDM fibroblasts was found around the rims of LDs and caused significantly reduced cellular lipid accumulation. In contrast, NLSDM ATGL was homogeneously located in the cytoplasm despite the presence of LDs and had almost no effect on LD degradation despite its similar lipase activity. A series of C-terminal truncated ATGLs without the intact hydrophobic domain failed to localize around and degrade LDs. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the domain including the hydrophobic region of ATGL was essential for association with LDs.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) catalyzes the first step in the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol (TG) generating diacylglycerol and free fatty acids. The enzyme requires the activator protein CGI-58 (or ABHD5) for full enzymatic activity. Defective ATGL function causes a recessively inherited disorder named neutral lipid storage disease that is characterized by systemic TG accumulation and myopathy. In this study, we investigated the functional defects associated with mutations in the ATGL gene that cause neutral lipid storage disease. We show that these mutations lead to the expression of either inactive enzymes localizing to lipid droplets (LDs) or enzymatically active lipases with defective LD binding. Additionally, our studies assign important regulatory functions to the C-terminal part of ATGL. Truncated mutant ATGL variants lacking approximately 220 amino acids of the C-terminal protein region do not localize to LDs. Interestingly, however, these mutants exhibit substantially increased TG hydrolase activity in vitro (up to 20-fold) compared with the wild-type enzyme, indicating that the C-terminal region suppresses enzyme activity. Protein-protein interaction studies revealed an increased binding of truncated ATGL to CGI-58, suggesting that the C-terminal part interferes with CGI-58 interaction and enzyme activation. Compared with the human enzyme, the C-terminal region of mouse ATGL is much less effective in suppressing enzyme activity, implicating species-dependent differences in enzyme regulation. Together, our results demonstrate that the C-terminal region of ATGL is essential for proper localization of the enzyme and suppresses enzyme activity.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The development and function of skeletal muscle depend on molecules that connect the muscle fiber cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (ECM). beta1 integrins are ECM receptors in skeletal muscle, and mutations that affect the alpha7beta1 integrin cause myopathy in humans. In mice, beta1 integrins control myoblast fusion, the assembly of the muscle fiber cytoskeleton, and the maintenance of myotendinous junctions (MTJs). The effector molecules that mediate beta1 integrin functions in muscle are not known. Previous studies have shown that talin 1 controls the force-dependent assembly of integrin adhesion complexes and regulates the affinity of integrins for ligands. Here we show that talin 1 is essential in skeletal muscle for the maintenance of integrin attachment sites at MTJs. Mice with a skeletal muscle-specific ablation of the talin 1 gene suffer from a progressive myopathy. Surprisingly, myoblast fusion and the assembly of integrin-containing adhesion complexes at costameres and MTJs advance normally in the mutants. However, with progressive ageing, the muscle fiber cytoskeleton detaches from MTJs. Mechanical measurements on isolated muscles show defects in the ability of talin 1-deficient muscle to generate force. Collectively, our findings show that talin 1 is essential for providing mechanical stability to integrin-dependent adhesion complexes at MTJs, which is crucial for optimal force generation by skeletal muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotubular myopathy (XLMTM, OMIM 310400) is a severe congenital muscular disease due to mutations in the myotubularin gene (MTM1) and characterized by the presence of small myofibers with frequent occurrence of central nuclei. Myotubularin is a ubiquitously expressed phosphoinositide phosphatase with a muscle-specific role in man and mouse that is poorly understood. No specific treatment exists to date for patients with myotubular myopathy. We have constructed an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing myotubularin in order to test its therapeutic potential in a XLMTM mouse model. We show that a single intramuscular injection of this vector in symptomatic Mtm1-deficient mice ameliorates the pathological phenotype in the targeted muscle. Myotubularin replacement in mice largely corrects nuclei and mitochondria positioning in myofibers and leads to a strong increase in muscle volume and recovery of the contractile force. In addition, we used this AAV vector to overexpress myotubularin in wild-type skeletal muscle and get insight into its localization and function. We show that a substantial proportion of myotubularin associates with the sarcolemma and I band, including triads. Myotubularin overexpression in muscle induces the accumulation of packed membrane saccules and presence of vacuoles that contain markers of sarcolemma and T-tubules, suggesting that myotubularin is involved in plasma membrane homeostasis of myofibers. This study provides a proof-of-principle that local delivery of an AAV vector expressing myotubularin can improve the motor capacities of XLMTM muscle and represents a novel approach to study myotubularin function in skeletal muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Phosphoinositides (PIs) are lipid second messengers implicated in signal transduction and membrane trafficking. Seven distinct PIs can be synthesized by phosphorylation of the inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), and their metabolism is accurately regulated by PI kinases and phosphatases. Two of the PIs, PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,5)P(2), are present on intracellular endosomal compartments, and several studies suggest that they have a role in membrane remodeling and trafficking. We refer to them as 'endosomal PIs'. An increasing number of human genetic diseases including myopathy and neuropathies are associated to mutations in enzymes regulating the turnover of these endosomal PIs. The PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,5)P(2) 3-phosphatase myotubularin gene is mutated in X-linked centronuclear myopathy, whereas its homologs MTMR2 and MTMR13 and the PtdIns(3,5)P(2) 5-phosphatase SAC3/FIG4 are implicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth peripheral neuropathies. Mutations in the gene encoding the PtdIns3P 5-kinase PIP5K3/PIKfyve have been found in patients affected with François-Neetens fleck corneal dystrophy. This review presents the roles of the endosomal PIs and their regulators and proposes defects of membrane remodeling as a common pathological mechanism for the corresponding diseases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Perlecan's developmental functions are difficult to dissect in placental animals because perlecan disruption is embryonic lethal. In contrast to mammals, cardiovascular function is not essential for early zebrafish development because the embryos obtain adequate oxygen by diffusion. In this study, we use targeted protein depletion coupled with protein-based rescue experiments to investigate the involvement of perlecan and its C-terminal domain V/endorepellin in zebrafish development. The perlecan morphants show a severe myopathy characterized by abnormal actin filament orientation and disorganized sarcomeres, suggesting an involvement of perlecan in myopathies. In the perlecan morphants, primary intersegmental vessel sprouts, which develop through angiogenesis, fail to extend and show reduced protrusive activity. Live videomicroscopy confirms the abnormal swimming pattern caused by the myopathy and anomalous head and trunk vessel circulation. The phenotype is partially rescued by microinjection of human perlecan or endorepellin. These findings indicate that perlecan is essential for the integrity of somitic muscle and developmental angiogenesis and that endorepellin mediates most of these biological activities.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>AMPD (AMP deaminase), an enzyme catalyzing AMP to IMP, plays an important role in purine/urate metabolism. AMPD is encoded in 3 genes for 3 isozymes M, L and E (H), respectively. In humans, 2 AMPD deficiencies have been reported in skeletal muscles (AMPD1 deficiency) and red blood cells (AMPD3 deficiency). AMPD1 deficiency has been found in patients with metabolic myopathy. AMPD regulates important purine nucleotides including ATP, ADP, AMP, IMP et al. Also, AMPD deficiency may change the level of adenosine, an important bioactive molecule. In addition, AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity, controlled by intracellular AMP, has an important role as an energy sensor. Therefore, AMPD may control the systemic metabolic status by changing AMPK activity through the AMP level.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: It is unclear to what extent muscle phosphorylase b kinase (PHK) deficiency is associated with exercise-related symptoms and impaired muscle metabolism, because 1) only four patients have been characterized at the molecular level, 2) reported symptoms have been nonspecific, and 3) lactate responses to ischemic handgrip exercise have been normal. METHODS: We studied a 50-year-old man with X-linked PHK deficiency using ischemic forearm and cycle ergometry exercise tests to define the derangement of muscle metabolism. We compared our findings with those in patients with McArdle disease and in healthy subjects. RESULTS: Sequencing of PHKA1 showed a novel pathogenic mutation (c.831G>A) in exon 7. There was a normal increase of plasma lactate during forearm ischemic exercise, but lactate did not change during dynamic, submaximal exercise in contrast to the fourfold increase in healthy subjects. Constant workload elicited a second wind in all patients with McArdle disease, but not in the patient with PHK deficiency. IV glucose administration appeared to improve exercise tolerance in the patient with PHK deficiency, but not to the same extent as in the patients with McArdle disease. Lipolysis was higher in the patient with PHK deficiency than in controls. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that X-linked PHK deficiency causes a mild metabolic myopathy with blunted muscle glycogen breakdown and impaired lactate production during dynamic exercise, which impairs oxidative capacity only marginally. The different response of lactate to submaximal and maximal exercise is likely related to differential activation mechanisms for myophosphorylase.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>LGMD2B, Miyoshi Myopathy and Distal Anterior Compartment Myopathy are caused by mutations in the dysferlin gene (DYSF) leading to progressive muscular weakness and wasting with onset usually within the second or third decade of life. We here present a patient with disease onset at 73 years. The presenting symptom was exercise-induced stiffness of the trunk and proximal leg muscles without major progression over a period of 12 years. Gastrocnemius muscle biopsy revealed dystrophic morphology and biochemical depletion of dysferlin, while sequence analysis revealed compound heterozygous splicing mutations of the dysferlin gene. This case represents the eldest age of onset of dysferlinopathy reported so far and widens the clinical spectrum of this disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mice with a malignant hyperthermia mutation (Y522S) in the ryanodine receptor (RyR1) display muscle contractures, rhabdomyolysis, and death in response to elevated environmental temperatures. We demonstrate that this mutation in RyR1 causes Ca(2+) leak, which drives increased generation of reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Subsequent S-nitrosylation of the mutant RyR1 increases its temperature sensitivity for activation, producing muscle contractures upon exposure to elevated temperatures. The Y522S mutation in humans is associated with central core disease. Many mitochondria in the muscle of heterozygous Y522S mice are swollen and misshapen. The mutant muscle displays decreased force production and increased mitochondrial lipid peroxidation with aging. Chronic treatment with N-acetylcysteine protects against mitochondrial oxidative damage and the decline in force generation. We propose a feed-forward cyclic mechanism that increases the temperature sensitivity of RyR1 activation and underlies heat stroke and sudden death. The cycle eventually produces a myopathy with damaged mitochondria.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) have been associated with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy, dominant intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) type B and CMT2. Here, we report a novel DNM2 mutation in the Pleckstrin homology domain of DNM2 (p.K559del) in a patient with an axonal length-dependent sensorimotor polyneuropathy predominantly affecting the lower limbs. Neuropathy is associated with congenital cataracts, ophthalmoparesis, ptosis and neutropenia. There was no evidence of a skeletal myopathy on EMG or muscle biopsy. We suggest that this constellation of clinical features can help the diagnosis and selection of patients for direct DNM2 genetic analysis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The myotubularin (MTM) enzymes are phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate phosphatases. Mutation of MTM1, the founder member of this family, is responsible for X-linked myotubular myopathy in humans. Here, we have isolated and characterized a Caenorhabditis elegans homology of the enzymes designated ceMTM3. ceMTM3 preferably dephosphorylates PI3P and contains a FYVE lipid-binding domain at its C-terminus which binds PI3P. Immunoblotting analyses revealed that the enzyme is expressed during the early development and adulthood of the animal. Immunofluorescent staining revealed predominant expression of the enzyme in eggs and muscles. Knockdown of the enzyme by using feeding-based RNA interference resulted in an increased level of PI3P and caused severe impairment of body movement of the worms at their post-reproductive ages and significantly shortened their lifespan. This study thus reveals an important role of the MTM phosphatases in maintaining muscle function, which may have clinical implications in prevention and treatment of sarcopenia.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>To date, six genes are known to cause nemaline (rod) myopathy (NM), a rare congenital neuromuscular disorder. In an attempt to find a seventh gene, we performed linkage and subsequent sequence analyses in 12 Turkish families with recessive NM. We found homozygosity in two of the families at 1q12-21.2, a region encompassing the gamma-tropomyosin gene (TPM3) encoding slow skeletal muscle alpha-tropomyosin, a known NM gene. Sequencing revealed homozygous deletion of the first nucleotide of the last exon, c.913delA of TPM3 in both families. The mutation removes the last nucleotide before the stop codon, causing a frameshift and readthrough across the termination signal. The encoded alphaTm(slow) protein is predicted to be 73 amino acids longer than normal, and the extension to the protein is hypothesised to be unable to form a coiled coil. The resulting tropomyosin protein may therefore be non-functional. The affected children in both families were homozygous for the mutation, while the healthy parents were mutation carriers. Both of the patients in Family 1 had the severe form of NM, and also an unusual chest deformity. The affected children in Family 2 had the intermediate form of NM. Muscle biopsies showed type 1 (slow) fibres to be markedly smaller than type 2 (fast) fibres. Previously, there had been five reports, only, of NM caused by mutations in TPM3. The mutation reported here is the first deletion to be identified in TPM3, and it is likely to be a founder mutation in the Turkish population.</rdfs:comment>

Unlike UCMD, BM is difficult to diagnose because of its clinical overlap with other contractural phenotypes and the lack of sensitivity of standard muscle biopsy immunohistochemical diagnostic techniques. METHODS: We appraised two potential techniques for the diagnosis of BM: dual immunofluorescence (IF) for collagen VI and basal lamina-located perlecan in muscle, and immunofluorescent labeling of collagen VI in skin biopsy-derived fibroblast cultures, which was conducted in 40 patients by blinded investigators and correlated with genetic findings. RESULTS: Dual IF was indistinguishable from normal controls in most BM patients. However, abnormalities in the IF labeling pattern of collagen VI were detected in more than 78% of genetically confirmed BM patient fibroblast cell lines. In addition, in a group of patients with unknown diagnosis studied prospectively, the fibroblast IF technique was highly predictive of the presence of a COL6A mutation, providing a positive predictive value of 75%, a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100%, and a specificity of 63%. CONCLUSIONS: Immunofluorescent labeling of collagen VI in fibroblast cultures is a useful addition to current diagnostic services for Bethlem myopathy (BM). It can be used to guide molecular genetic testing, the gold standard diagnostic technique for BM, in a cost-effective and time-saving manner.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hereditary inclusion body myopathy/distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles is an adult onset autosomal recessive muscle-wasting disease common in people of Iranian-Jewish descent, due to the founder allelic variant GNE:p.M712T. High correlation of disease susceptibility with GNE:p.M712T allows its use as a molecular marker for diagnosis. In this study, we applied and validated the use of melting curve analysis using SimpleProbe technology for detection of this mutation using specimens obtained by mouthwash, buccal swab, and whole blood. The assay was then applied to 43 clinical specimens, and results were validated by additional methods. A probe spanning this mutation in exon 12 accurately discerns two Tm corresponding to its hybridization to wild-type and M712T-derived amplicons. A 10 degrees C divergence in Tm allowed rapid single-tube genotyping of reference and patient samples with 100% accuracy. Distal myopathy constitutes a large heterogeneous group of pathologies with similar physiological manifestations and little molecular markers for distinguishing subtypes. Application of SimpleProbes for detection of GNE:p.M712T on genomic DNA obtained from buccal epithelial cells allows accurate, rapid, and cost-effective identification of this allele in individuals at risk. This procedure is amenable to automated high-throughput applications and can be extended to both clinical and research applications.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the genes encoding collagen VI (COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3) cause Bethlem myopathy (BM) and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD), two related conditions of differing severity. BM is a relatively mild dominantly inherited disorder characterized by proximal weakness and distal joint contractures. UCMD was originally regarded as an exclusively autosomal recessive condition causing severe muscle weakness with proximal joint contractures and distal hyperlaxity. We and others have subsequently modified this model when we described UCMD patients with heterozygous in-frame deletions acting in a dominant-negative way. Here we report 10 unrelated patients with a UCMD clinical phenotype and de novo dominant negative heterozygous splice mutations in COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 and contrast our findings with four UCMD patients with recessively acting splice mutations and two BM patients with heterozygous splice mutations. We find that the location of the skipped exon relative to the molecular structure of the collagen chain strongly correlates with the clinical phenotype. Analysis by immunohistochemical staining of muscle biopsies and dermal fibroblast cultures, as well as immunoprecipitation to study protein biosynthesis and assembly, suggests different mechanisms each for exon skipping mutations underlying dominant UCMD, dominant BM, and recessive UCMD. We provide further evidence that de novo dominant mutations in severe UCMD occur relatively frequently in all three collagen VI chains and offer biochemical insight into genotype-phenotype correlations within the collagen VI-related disorders by showing that severity of the phenotype depends on the ability of mutant chains to be incorporated in the multimeric structure of collagen VI.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Polysaccharide storage myopathy (PSSM) is a novel glycogenosis in horses characterized by abnormal glycogen accumulation in skeletal muscle and muscle damage with exertion. It is unlike glycogen storage diseases resulting from known defects in glycogenolysis, glycolysis, and glycogen synthesis that have been described in humans and domestic animals. A genome-wide association identified GYS1, encoding skeletal muscle glycogen synthase (GS), as a candidate gene for PSSM. DNA sequence analysis revealed a mutation resulting in an arginine-to-histidine substitution in a highly conserved region of GS. Functional analysis demonstrated an elevated GS activity in PSSM horses, and haplotype analysis and allele age estimation demonstrated that this mutation is identical by descent among horse breeds. This is the first report of a gain-of-function mutation in GYS1 resulting in a glycogenosis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The acronym IBMPFD denotes a syndrome including inclusion body myopathy, Paget's disease of the bone (PDB) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) as cardinal features, which is caused by missense mutations in the VCP gene. We studied the clinical characteristics and the histopathological features in two siblings and their mother who presented with adult-onset myopathy and presenile, rapidly progressive FTD. One sibling also showed PDB. Light and electron microscopy performed on muscle biopsies demonstrated degenerative changes with inclusion bodies and abnormal aggregates. Mutation analysis of the VCP gene on affected siblings revealed a heterozygous missense mutation (R155H) in a hot spot. This is the first Italian family with multiple individuals diagnosed as having IBMPFD and carrying the recurrent R155H mutation. The implications for genetic counselling were also discussed, with regard to the procedures that may be offered to families suffering from a multisystem disorder with high risk of cognitive decline.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We present a 6-year-old girl with premature aging associated with mild myopathy, displaying muscle weakness, joint contractures and hyporeflexia. Genetic analysis revealed rare heterozygous point mutation in lamin A/C gene, g.428C>T. Cardiological evaluation showed atrial fibrillation, but we did not find signs of coronary heart disease, which is life-threatening cardiovascular complication in progeria. Electron microscopy of the muscle revealed abnormalities in nuclear architecture, i.e. blebbing, thick lamina and peripheral distribution of heterochromatin. As some diagnostic criteria characteristic for classic progeria are not fulfilled, this case could be regarded as atypical progeria associated with myopathy and atrial fibrillation. To our knowledge, this is the second case of such association described in the literature.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Dysferlin (DYSF) gene mutations cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and Miyoshi's myopathy. The consequences of DYSF mutations on protein structure are poorly understood. METHODS: The gene encoding dysferlin was sequenced in patients with suspected dysferlin-deficient muscular dystrophy. Muscle biopsy specimens were analyzed by histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Antibodies against N-terminal dysferlin-peptides were raised. RESULTS: We found three families with muscular dystrophy caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous DYSF mutations featuring sarcolemmal and interstitial amyloid deposits. These mutations were all located in the N-terminal region of the protein. Dysferlin was a constituent of the amyloid deposits. INTERPRETATION: Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B is the first muscular dystrophy associated with amyloidosis. Molecular treatment strategies will necessarily have to consider the presence of amyloidogenesis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A myopathy with severe exercise intolerance and myoglobinuria has been described in patients from northern Sweden, with associated deficiencies of succinate dehydrogenase and aconitase in skeletal muscle. We identified the gene for the iron-sulfur cluster scaffold protein ISCU as a candidate within a region of shared homozygosity among patients with this disease. We found a single mutation in ISCU that likely strengthens a weak splice acceptor site, with consequent exon retention. A marked reduction of ISCU mRNA and mitochondrial ISCU protein in patient muscle was associated with a decrease in the iron regulatory protein IRP1 and intracellular iron overload in skeletal muscle, consistent with a muscle-specific alteration of iron homeostasis in this disease. ISCU interacts with the Friedreich ataxia gene product frataxin in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis. Our results therefore extend the range of known human diseases that are caused by defects in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We discuss four cases of acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency (EC, 3.2.1.3/20) without evident symptoms of Pompe disease (OMIM No 232300) in individuals of Asian descent. In three cases, the deficiency was associated with homozygosity for the sequence variant c.[1726G>A; 2065G>A] in the acid alpha-glucosidase gene (GAA) translating into p.[G576S; E689K]. One of these cases was a patient with profound muscular atrophy, another had cardio-myopathy and the third had no symptoms. The fourth case, the mother of a child with Pompe disease, was compound heterozygote for the GAA sequence variants c.[1726G>A; 2065G>A]/c.2338G>A (p.W746X) and had no symptoms either. Further investigations revealed that c.[1726A; 2065A] is a common GAA allele in the Japanese and Chinese populations. Our limited study predicts that approximately 4% of individuals in these populations are homozygote c.[1726A; 2065A]. The height of this figure in contrast to the rarity of Pompe disease in Asian populations and the clinical history of the cases described in this paper virtually exclude that homozygosity for c.[1726A; 2065A] causes Pompe disease. As c.[1726A; 2065A] homozygotes have been observed with similarly low acid alpha-glucosidase activity as some patients with Pompe disease, we caution they may present as false positives in newborn screening programs especially in Asian populations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD) is a rare form of congenital myopathy in which the principal histological abnormality is hypotrophy of type 1 (slow-twitch) fibers compared with type 2 (fast-twitch) fibers. To date, mutation of ACTA1 and SEPN1 has been associated with CFTD, but the genetic basis in most patients is unclear. The gene encoding alpha-tropomyosin(slow) (TPM3) is a rare cause of nemaline myopathy, previously reported in only five families. We investigated whether mutation of TPM3 is a cause of CFTD. METHODS AND RESULTS: We sequenced TPM3 in 23 unrelated probands with CFTD or CFTD-like presentations of unknown cause and identified novel heterozygous missense mutations in five CFTD families (p. Leu100Met, p.Arg168Cys, p.Arg168Gly, p.Lys169Glu, p.Arg245Gly). All affected family members that underwent biopsy had typical histological features of CFTD, with type 1 fibers, on average, at least 50% smaller than type 2 fibers. We also report a sixth family in which a recurrent TPM3 mutation (p.Arg168His) was associated with histological features of CFTD and nemaline myopathy in different family members. We describe the clinical features of 11 affected patients. Typically, there was proximal limb girdle weakness, prominent weakness of neck flexion and ankle dorsiflexion, mild facial weakness, and mild ptosis. The age of onset and severity varied, even within the same family. Many patients required nocturnal noninvasive ventilation despite remaining ambulant. INTERPRETATION: Mutation of TPM3 is the most common cause of CFTD reported to date.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We describe the mapping and identification of the gene for hereditary myopathy with lactic acidosis (HML). HML is characterized by low physical performance, resulting in physical exertion that causes early exhaustion, dyspnoea and palpitations. Using an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, we mapped the trait to chromosome 12q23.3-24.11, with a maximum lod score of 5.26. The 1.6-Mb disease-critical region contained one obvious candidate gene-ISCU-specifying a protein involved in iron-sulphur cluster assembly. IscU is produced in two isoforms; one cytosolic and one mitochondrial, coded for by different splice variants of the ISCU gene. Mutational analysis of all exon and intron sequences as well as 1000 bp of the promoter of the ISCU gene revealed one intron mutation that was specific for the disease haplotype. The mutation is located in a region with homology to the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE), but we could not see any effect of the mutation on expression levels in vitro or in vivo. We did, however, observe a drastic difference in the splicing pattern between patients and controls. In controls the mRNA was, as expected, mainly in the mitochondrial form, while in the patients a larger mRNA transcript was predominant. Sequencing of the product revealed that the mutation activates cryptic splice sites in intron 5 resulting in aberrant mRNA containing 100 bp of the intron. To conclude, our data strongly suggest that an intron mutation in the ISCU gene, leading to incorrectly spliced mRNA, is the cause of myopathy with lactic acidosis in this family.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlin protein (DYSF) is a ferlin family member found in sarcolemma and is involved in membrane repair, muscle differentiation, membrane fusion, etc. The deficiency of DYSF due to mutations is associated with different pathologic phenotypes including the autosomal recessive limb-girdle type 2B phenotype (LGMD2B), a distal anterior compartment myopathy (DMAT), and the Miyoshi myopathy (MM). In this study, we determined a missense mutation c.4253G>A on the DYSF gene in a Mexican family from an endogamic population. This mutation was assumed to be the cause of dystrophy because only homozygous individuals of the family manifest a clinical phenotype. Structural implications caused by G/D substitution at amino acid position 1418 are discussed in terms of potential importance of the dysferlin neighboring sequence.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome (MSS) is a rare autosomal recessively inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia, cataracts, mental retardation, and progressive myopathy. Recently, mutations in the SIL1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident cochaperone, were identified as a major cause of MSS. We here report four novel mutations in SIL1, including the first missense substitution p.Leu457Pro described in MSS. In addition, we excluded three functional candidate genes, HSPA5, HYOU1, and AARS, as causative genes in SIL1 mutation-negative patients. To understand the mechanisms of disturbed SIL1 function, we studied the subcellular localization of the missense mutant Leu457Pro protein in COS-1 cells. Moreover, we studied a mutant protein lacking the putative C-terminal ER retrieval signal. In contrast to the wild-type protein's localization to ER and Golgi apparatus, both mutant proteins formed aggregates within the ER depending on the expression level. These data imply that aggregation of mutant proteins may contribute to MSS pathogenesis. The genetic background of a subgroup of patients with MSS remains uncovered.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The evolutionary conserved protein Cdc48/VCP is involved in various cellular processes, such as protein degradation, membrane fusion and chaperone activity. Increased levels of Cdc48/VCP correlate with cancer, whereas Cdc48/VCP at endogenous levels has been proposed to be a pathological effector in protein deposition diseases. Upon mutation Cdc48/VCP triggers the multisystem disorder 'inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia' (IBMPFD). The roles of Cdc48/VCP under these diverse pathological conditions, especially its function in decreased and increased incidences of cell death underlying these diseases, are poorly understood. Mutation of yeast CDC48 (cdc48(S565G)) results in yeast cells demonstrating morphological markers of apoptotic cell death. In other species it has been confirmed that mutations and depletion of Cdc48/VCP cause apoptosis, whereas increased levels of this protein provide an anti-apoptotic effect. This review critically compares mechanisms of Cdc48/VCP-mediated apoptosis observed in yeast and other species. Cdc48/VCP plays a triple role in cell death. At first, loss-of-function of Cdc48/VCP due to mutation or depletion causes ER stress and oxidative stress, triggering apoptosis. Secondly, upon exogenously applied ER stress functional Cdc48/VCP is important in the processing of caspases and plays therewith a pro-apoptotic role. Finally, Cdc48/VCP protects cells from apoptosis through mediating and activating pro-survival signaling pathways, namely Akt and NFkappaB signaling. This complex role in cell death pathways could correspond with the various pathophysiological conditions Cdc48/VCP is involved in.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Muscle cells are surrounded by extracellular matrix, the components of which play an important role in signalling mechanisms involved in their development. In mice, loss of collagen XV, a component of basement membranes expressed primarily in skeletal muscles, results in a mild skeletal myopathy. We have determined the complete zebrafish collagen XV primary sequence and analysed its expression and function in embryogenesis. During the segmentation period, expression of the Col15a1 gene is mainly found in the notochord and its protein product is deposited exclusively in the peri-notochordal basement membrane. Morpholino mediated knock-down of Col15a1 causes defects in notochord differentiation and in fast and slow muscle formation as shown by persistence of axial mesodermal marker gene expression, disorganization of the peri-notochodal basement membrane and myofibrils, and a U-shape myotome. In addition, the number of medial fast-twitch muscle fibers was substantially increased, suggesting that the signalling by notochord derived Hh proteins is enhanced by loss of collagen XV. Consistent with this, there is a concomitant expansion of patched-1 expression in the myotome of morphant embryos. Together, these results indicate that collagen XV is required for notochord differentiation and muscle development in the zebrafish embryo and that it interplays with Shh signalling.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The majority of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations that cause human disease are mild to moderately deleterious, yet many random mtDNA mutations would be expected to be severe. To determine the fate of the more severe mtDNA mutations, we introduced mtDNAs containing two mutations that affect oxidative phosphorylation into the female mouse germ line. The severe ND6 mutation was selectively eliminated during oogenesis within four generations, whereas the milder COI mutation was retained throughout multiple generations even though the offspring consistently developed mitochondrial myopathy and cardiomyopathy. Thus, severe mtDNA mutations appear to be selectively eliminated from the female germ line, thereby minimizing their impact on population fitness.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlin deficiency causes limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B; proximal weakness) and Miyoshi myopathy (distal weakness). Muscle inflammation is often present in dysferlin deficiency, and patients are frequently misdiagnosed as having polymyositis. Because monocytes normally express dysferlin, we hypothesized that monocyte/macrophage dysfunction in dysferlin-deficient patients might contribute to disease onset and progression. We therefore examined phagocytic activity, in the presence and absence of cytokines, in freshly isolated peripheral blood monocytes from LGMD2B patients and in the SJL dysferlin-deficient mouse model. Dysferlin-deficient monocytes showed increased phagocytic activity compared with control cells. siRNA-mediated inhibition of dysferlin expression in the J774 macrophage cell line resulted in significantly enhanced phagocytosis, both at baseline and in response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive staining for several mononuclear cell activation markers in LGMD2B human muscle and SJL mouse muscle. SJL muscle showed strong up-regulation of endocytic proteins CIMPR, clathrin, and adaptin-alpha, and LGMD2B muscle exhibited decreased expression of decay accelerating factor, which was not dysferlin-specific. We further showed that expression levels of small Rho family GTPases RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc 42 were increased in dysferlin-deficient murine immune cells compared with control cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that mild myofiber damage in dysferlin-deficient muscle stimulates an inflammatory cascade that may initiate, exacerbate, and possibly perpetuate the underlying myofiber-specific dystrophic process.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Here we describe three novel collagen VI chains, alpha4, alpha5, and alpha6. The corresponding genes are arranged in tandem on mouse chromosome 9. The new chains structurally resemble the collagen VI alpha3 chain. Each chain consists of seven von Willebrand factor A domains followed by a collagenous domain, two C-terminal von Willebrand factor A domains, and a unique domain. In addition, the collagen VI alpha4 chain carries a Kunitz domain at the C terminus, whereas the collagen VI alpha5 chain contains an additional von Willebrand factor A domain and a unique domain. The size of the collagenous domains and the position of the structurally important cysteine residues within these domains are identical between the collagen VI alpha3, alpha4, alpha5, and alpha6 chains. In mouse, the new chains are found in or close to basement membranes. Collagen VI alpha1 chain-deficient mice lack expression of the new collagen VI chains implicating that the new chains may substitute for the alpha3 chain, probably forming alpha1alpha2alpha4, alpha1alpha2alpha5, or alpha1alpha2alpha6 heterotrimers. Due to a large scale pericentric inversion, the human COL6A4 gene on chromosome 3 was broken into two pieces and became a non-processed pseudogene. Recently COL6A5 was linked to atopic dermatitis and designated COL29A1. The identification of novel collagen VI chains carries implications for the etiology of atopic dermatitis as well as Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Reducing body myopathy (RBM) is a rare disorder causing progressive muscular weakness characterized by aggresome-like inclusions in the myofibrils. Identification of genes responsible for RBM by traditional genetic approaches has been impossible due to the frequently sporadic occurrence in affected patients and small family sizes. As an alternative approach to gene identification, we used laser microdissection of intracytoplasmic inclusions identified in patient muscle biopsies, followed by nanoflow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and proteomic analysis. The most prominent component of the inclusions was the Xq26.3-encoded four and a half LIM domain 1 (FHL1) protein, expressed predominantly in skeletal but also in cardiac muscle. Mutational analysis identified 4 FHL1 mutations in 2 sporadic unrelated females and in 2 families with severely affected boys and less-affected mothers. Transfection of kidney COS-7 and skeletal muscle C2C12 cells with mutant FHL1 induced the formation of aggresome-like inclusions that incorporated both mutant and wild-type FHL1 and trapped other proteins in a dominant-negative manner. Thus, a novel laser microdissection/proteomics approach has helped identify both inherited and de novo mutations in FHL1, thereby defining a new X-linked protein aggregation disorder of muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Growing evidence supports the importance of ubiquitin ligases in the pathogenesis of muscular disorders, although underlying mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here we show that the expression of RNF5 (aka RMA1), an ER-anchored RING finger E3 ligase implicated in muscle organization and in recognition and processing of malfolded proteins, is elevated and mislocalized to cytoplasmic aggregates in biopsies from patients suffering from sporadic-Inclusion Body Myositis (sIBM). Consistent with these findings, an animal model for hereditary IBM (hIBM), but not their control littermates, revealed deregulated expression of RNF5. Further studies for the role of RNF5 in the pathogenesis of s-IBM and more generally in muscle physiology were performed using RNF5 transgenic and KO animals. Transgenic mice carrying inducible expression of RNF5, under control of beta-actin or muscle specific promoter, exhibit an early onset of muscle wasting, muscle degeneration and extensive fiber regeneration. Prolonged expression of RNF5 in the muscle also results in the formation of fibers containing congophilic material, blue-rimmed vacuoles and inclusion bodies. These phenotypes were associated with altered expression and activity of ER chaperones, characteristic of myodegenerative diseases such as s-IBM. Conversely, muscle regeneration and induction of ER stress markers were delayed in RNF5 KO mice subjected to cardiotoxin treatment. While supporting a role for RNF5 Tg mice as model for s-IBM, our study also establishes the importance of RNF5 in muscle physiology and its deregulation in ER stress associated muscular disorders.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are nonselective cation channels, several of which are expressed in striated muscle. Because the scaffolding protein Homer 1 has been implicated in TRP channel regulation, we hypothesized that Homer proteins play a significant role in skeletal muscle function. Mice lacking Homer 1 exhibited a myopathy characterized by decreased muscle fiber cross-sectional area and decreased skeletal muscle force generation. Homer 1 knockout myotubes displayed increased basal current density and spontaneous cation influx. This spontaneous cation influx in Homer 1 knockout myotubes was blocked by reexpression of Homer 1b, but not Homer 1a, and by gene silencing of TRPC1. Moreover, diminished Homer 1 expression in mouse models of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy suggests that loss of Homer 1 scaffolding of TRP channels may contribute to the increased stretch-activated channel activity observed in mdx myofibers. These findings provide direct evidence that Homer 1 functions as an important scaffold for TRP channels and regulates mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a heritable disorder with male predilection, suggesting a sex chromosome defect in certain patients. Loss-of-function truncation mutations in EMD, encoding the nuclear membrane protein emerin, cause X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) characterized by localized contractures and skeletal myopathy in adolescence, sinus node dysfunction (SND) in early adulthood, and atrial fibrillation as a variably associated trait. This study sought to identify the genetic basis for male-restricted, nonsyndromic sinus node dysfunction and AF in a multigenerational family. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genealogical and medical records, and DNA samples, were obtained. Progressive SND and AF occurred in four males related through maternal lineages, consistent with X-linked inheritance. Skeletal myopathy was absent, even at advanced ages. Targeted X chromosome genotyping mapped the disease locus to Xq28, implicating EMD as a positional candidate gene. DNA sequencing revealed hemizygosity for an in-frame 3-bp deletion in EMD (Lys37del) in affected males, disrupting a residue within the LEM binding domain critical for nuclear assembly but leaving the remainder of the protein intact. Buccal epithelial cell staining with emerin antibody demonstrated near-total functional loss of emerin. Female relatives underwent prospective electrocardiographic and genetic testing. Those heterozygous for Lys37del had approximately 50-70% emerin-positive nuclei and variable degrees of paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmia. CONCLUSIONS: Mutation of EMD can underlie X-linked familial AF. Lys37del is associated with epithelial cell emerin deficiency, as in EDMD, yet it causes electrical atriomyopathy in the absence of skeletal muscle disease. Targeted genetic testing of EMD should be considered in patients with SND-associated AF and/or family history suggesting X-linked inheritance.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>CONTEXT: X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH) is characterized by hypophosphatemia and growth retardation. Early diagnosis and treatment improve growth. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to describe long-term observations of a family with XLH due to a novel mutation of the PHEX gene with unusual clinical features, including normal growth. PATIENTS: The mother and her two sons were followed in the same institution for nearly 30 yr. RESULTS: The mother had hypophosphatemia and normal height (Z score, -0.6) without ever receiving any treatment. Her two sons achieved final heights of 183.7 cm (Z score, -0.01) and 182.7 cm (Z score, -0.18), respectively, despite late initiation of treatment with phosphate and low serum phosphate levels. In addition, they had reversible proximal myopathy that took about 7 yr to resolve in one of them. Direct sequencing of the PHEX gene revealed a new splice site mutation in intron 4 of the gene (IVS4+6T-->C) resulting in skipping of exon 4. CONCLUSIONS: Three members of a family with XLH due to a novel mutation of the PHEX gene had a normal growth pattern despite late diagnosis and treatment of the two boys and no treatment at all of their mother. The pathophysiological basis of this phenotype-genotype association warrants further investigation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2D (LGMD2D, OMIM600119) is a genetic progressive myopathy that is caused by mutations in the human alpha-sarcoglycan gene (SGCA). Here, we have introduced in mice the most prevalent LGMD2D mutation, R77C. It should be noted that the natural murine residue at this position is a histidine. The model is, therefore, referred as Sgca(H77C/H77C). Unexpectedly, we observed an absence of LGMD2D-like phenotype at histological or physiological level. Using a heterologous cellular model of the sarcoglycan complex formation, we showed that the R77C allele encodes a protein that fails to be delivered to its proper cellular localization in the plasma membrane, and consequently to the disappearance of a positively charged residue. Subsequently, we transferred an AAV vector coding for the human R77C protein in the muscle of Sgca-null mice and were able to pharmacologically rescue the R77C protein from endoplasmic reticulum-retention using proteasome or mannosidase I inhibitors. This suggests a therapeutic approach for LGMD2D patients carrying mutations that impair alpha-sarcoglycan trafficking.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Here we investigate the effects of a myopathy-causing mutation in alphaB-crystallin, Q151X, upon its structure and function. This mutation removes the C-terminal domain of alphaB-crystallin, which is expected to compromise both its oligomerization and chaperone activity. We compared this to two other alphaB-crystallin mutants (450delA, 464delCT) and also to a series of C-terminal truncations (E164X, E165X, K174X, and A171X). We find that the effects of the Q151X mutation were not always as predicted. Specifically, we have found that although the Q151X mutation decreased oligomerization of alphaB-crystallin and even increased some chaperone activities, it also significantly destabilized alphaB-crystallin causing it to self-aggregate. This conclusion was supported by our analyses of both the other disease-causing mutants and the series of C-terminal truncation constructs of alphaB-crystallin. The 450delA and 464delCT mutants could only be refolded and assayed as a complex with wild type alphaB-crystallin, which was not the case for Q151X alphaB-crystallin. From these studies, we conclude that all three disease-causing mutations (450delA, 464delCT, and Q151X) in the C-terminal extension destabilize alphaB-crystallin and increase its tendency to self-aggregate. We propose that it is this, rather than a catastrophic loss of chaperone activity, which is a major factor in the development of the reported diseases for the three disease-causing mutations studied here. In support of this hypothesis, we show that Q151X alphaB-crystallin is found mainly in the insoluble fraction of cell extracts from transient transfected cells, due to the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>PURPOSE: Presenting the case of unusual onset hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) where myopathy had developed two years before paralysis occurred. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Polish three-generation family with HypoPP and mutation in CACNA1S (R1239G) has been investigated. Clinical presentation with unusual onset of the disease, biopsy results and genetic research in one family member were described. CONCLUSION: HypoPP is a rare disease it needs to be taken into consideration not only in cases of paroxysmal weakness but also when there is myopathy of unknown origin.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) is the initial component of a pentose phosphate pathway inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that generates NADPH for ER enzymes. In liver H6PD is required for the 11-oxoreductase activity of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, which converts inactive 11-oxo-glucocorticoids to their active 11-hydroxyl counterparts; consequently, H6PD null mice are relatively insensitive to glucocorticoids, exhibiting fasting hypoglycemia, increased insulin sensitivity despite elevated circulating levels of corticosterone, and increased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscles normally enriched in type II (fast) fibers, which have increased glycogen content. Here, we show that H6PD null mice develop a severe skeletal myopathy characterized by switching of type II to type I (slow) fibers. Running wheel activity and electrically stimulated force generation in isolated skeletal muscle are both markedly reduced. Affected muscles have normal sarcomeric structure at the electron microscopy level but contain large intrafibrillar membranous vacuoles and abnormal triads indicative of defects in structure and function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). SR proteins involved in calcium metabolism, including the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), calreticulin, and calsequestrin, show dysregulated expression. Microarray analysis and real-time PCR demonstrate overexpression of genes encoding proteins in the unfolded protein response pathway. We propose that the absence of H6PD induces a progressive myopathy by altering the SR redox state, thereby impairing protein folding and activating the unfolded protein response pathway. These studies thus define a novel metabolic pathway that links ER stress to skeletal muscle integrity and function.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Heart failure is the leading cause of death in the elderly, but whether this is the result of a primary aging myopathy dictated by depletion of the cardiac progenitor cell (CPC) pool is unknown. Similarly, whether current lifespan reflects the ineluctable genetic clock or heart failure interferes with the genetically determined fate of the organ and organism is an important question. We have identified that chronological age leads to telomeric shortening in CPCs, which by necessity generate a differentiated progeny that rapidly acquires the senescent phenotype conditioning organ aging. CPC aging is mediated by attenuation of the insulin-like growth factor-1/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met systems, which do not counteract any longer the CPC renin-angiotensin system, resulting in cellular senescence, growth arrest, and apoptosis. However, pulse-chase 5-bromodeoxyuridine-labeling assay revealed that the senescent heart contains functionally competent CPCs that have the properties of stem cells. This subset of telomerase-competent CPCs have long telomeres and, following activation, migrate to the regions of damage, where they generate a population of young cardiomyocytes, reversing partly the aging myopathy. The senescent heart phenotype and heart failure are corrected to some extent, leading to prolongation of maximum lifespan.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Autosomal recessive hereditary inclusion-body myopathy (h-IBM) is caused by mutations of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase gene, a rate-limiting enzyme in the sialic acid metabolic pathway. Previous studies have demonstrated an abnormal sialylation of glycoproteins in h-IBM. h-IBM muscle shows the abnormal accumulation of proteins including amyloid-beta (Abeta). Neprilysin (NEP), a metallopeptidase that cleaves Abeta, is characterized by the presence of several N-glycosylation sites, and changes in these sugar moieties affect its stability and enzymatic activity. In the present study, we found that NEP is hyposialylated and its expression and enzymatic activity reduced in all h-IBM muscles analyzed. In vitro, the experimental removal of sialic acid by Vibrio Cholerae neuraminidase in cultured myotubes resulted in reduced expression of NEP. This was most likely because of a post-translational modification consisting in an abnormal sialylation of the protein that leads to its reduced stability. Moreover, treatment with Vibrio Cholerae neuraminidase was associated with an increased immunoreactivity for Abeta mainly in the form of distinct cytoplasmic foci within myotubes. We hypothesize that, in h-IBM muscle, hyposialylated NEP has a role in hampering the cellular Abeta clearing system, thus contributing to its abnormal accumulation within vulnerable fibers and possibly promoting muscle degeneration.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Scapuloperoneal (SP) syndrome encompasses heterogeneous neuromuscular disorders characterized by weakness in the shoulder-girdle and peroneal muscles. In a large Italian-American pedigree with dominant SP myopathy (SPM) previously linked to chromosome 12q, we have mapped the disease to Xq26, and, in all of the affected individuals, we identified a missense change (c.365G-->C) in the FHL1 gene encoding four-and-a-half-LIM protein 1 (FHL1). The mutation substitutes a serine for a conserved trypophan at amino acid 122 in the second LIM domain of the protein. Western blot analyses of muscle extracts revealed FHL1 loss that paralleled disease severity. FHL1 and an isoform, FHL1C, are highly expressed in skeletal muscle and may contribute to stability of sarcomeres and sarcolemma, myofibrillary assembly, and transcriptional regulation. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of X-linked dominant SP myopathy and the first human mutation in FHL1.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We have identified a large multigenerational Austrian family displaying a novel form of X-linked recessive myopathy. Affected individuals develop an adult-onset scapulo-axio-peroneal myopathy with bent-spine syndrome characterized by specific atrophy of postural muscles along with pseudoathleticism or hypertrophy and cardiac involvement. Known X-linked myopathies were excluded by simple-tandem-repeat polymorphism (STRP) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, direct gene sequencing, and immunohistochemical analysis. STRP analysis revealed significant linkage at Xq25-q27.1. Haplotype analysis based on SNP microarray data from selected family members confirmed this linkage region on the distal arm of the X chromosome, thereby narrowing down the critical interval to 12 Mb. Sequencing of functional candidate genes led to the identification of a missense mutation within the four and a half LIM domain 1 gene (FHL1), which putatively disrupts the fourth LIM domain of the protein. Mutation screening of FHL1 in a myopathy family from the UK exhibiting an almost identical phenotype revealed a 3 bp insertion mutation within the second LIM domain. FHL1 on Xq26.3 is highly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles. Western-blot analysis of muscle biopsies showed a marked decrease in protein expression of FHL1 in patients, in concordance with the genetic data. In summary, we have to our knowledge characterized a new disorder, X-linked myopathy with postural muscle atrophy (XMPMA), and identified FHL1 as the causative gene. This is the first FHL protein to be identified in conjunction with a human genetic disorder and further supports the role of FHL proteins in the development and maintenance of muscle tissue. Mutation screening of FHL1 should be considered for patients with uncharacterized myopathies and cardiomyopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in OPA1, a dynamin-related GTPase involved in mitochondrial fusion, cristae organization and control of apoptosis, have been linked to non-syndromic optic neuropathy transmitted as an autosomal-dominant trait (DOA). We here report on eight patients from six independent families showing that mutations in the OPA1 gene can also be responsible for a syndromic form of DOA associated with sensorineural deafness, ataxia, axonal sensory-motor polyneuropathy, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia and mitochondrial myopathy with cytochrome c oxidase negative and Ragged Red Fibres. Most remarkably, we demonstrate that these patients all harboured multiple deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in their skeletal muscle, thus revealing an unrecognized role of the OPA1 protein in mtDNA stability. The five OPA1 mutations associated with these DOA 'plus' phenotypes were all mis-sense point mutations affecting highly conserved amino acid positions and the nuclear genes previously known to induce mtDNA multiple deletions such as POLG1, PEO1 (Twinkle) and SLC25A4 (ANT1) were ruled out. Our results show that certain OPA1 mutations exert a dominant negative effect responsible for multi-systemic disease, closely related to classical mitochondrial cytopathies, by a mechanism involving mtDNA instability.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Desmin myopathy was identified in a Chinese man with complete heart block and mild proximal and distal limb weakness. A novel heterozygous missense S13F mutation of the desmin gene was found to be associated with the myopathy. Family members carrying the mutation showed a similar or milder phenotype. The mutation is located at a protein kinase-C phosphorylation site within a highly conserved nonapeptide sequence in the head domain of the desmin protein. Expression of the mutant desmin cDNA in cell lines induced large desmin accumulations associated with preservation of a filamentous network.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Limb-girdle muscle dystrophy type 2I is associated with mutations in the gene encoding Fukutin-related protein. Clinical phenotypes are heterogeneous, ranging from isolated hyperCkemia to severe congenital muscular dystrophy. Affected patients frequently develop dilated cardiomyopathy, depending on evolution of their skeletal myopathy. We report on an 8 years-old boy presenting a severe dilated cardiomyopathy requiring heart transplantation. The child harbored a homozygous p.Leu276Ile mutation in Fukutin-related protein gene (FKRP). At the current age of 20 years, the patient shows persistent hyperCKemia but no clinical muscle weakness, CT scan showing very mild features of muscle involvement. Our findings add to the array of clinical presentations of FKRP mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report 10 children (7 male, 3 female), 3 homozygous for c.319C>T mutation and 7 heterozygous for c.319C>T on one allele and c.625G>A variant on the other in the short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) gene (ACADS). All were of Ashkenazi Jewish origin in which group we found a c.319C>T heterozygote frequency of 1:15 suggesting the presence of a founder mutation or selective advantage. Phenotype was variable with onset from birth to early childhood. Features included hypotonia (8/10), developmental delay (8/10), myopathy (4/10) with multicore changes in two and lipid storage in one, facial weakness (3/10), lethargy (5/10), feeding difficulties (4/10) and congenital abnormalities (3/7). One female with multiminicore myopathy had progressive external ophthalmoplegia, ptosis and cardiomyopathy with pneumonia and respiratory failure. Two brothers presented with psychosis, pyramidal signs, and multifocal white matter abnormalities on MRI brain suggesting additional genetic factors. Two other infants also had white matter changes. Elevated butyrylcarnitine (4/8), ethylmalonic aciduria (9/9), methylsuccinic aciduria (6/7), decreased butyrate oxidation in lymphoblasts (2/4) and decreased SCAD activity in fibroblasts or muscle (3/3) were shown. Expression studies of c.319C>T in mouse liver mitochondria showed it to be inactivating. c.625G>A is a common variant in ACADS that may confer disease susceptibility. Five healthy parents were heterozygous for c.319C>T and c.625G>A, suggesting reduced penetrance or broad clinical spectrum. We conclude that the c.319C>T mutation can lead to wide clinical and biochemical phenotypic variability, suggesting a complex multifactorial/polygenic condition. This should be screened for in individuals with multicore myopathy, particularly among the Ashkenazim.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Danon disease is a rare X-linked dominant disorder caused by lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) deficiency and is characterized by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac conduction abnormalities, skeletal vacuolar myopathy, variable degree of mental retardation, and peripheral pigmentary retinopathy. We describe a novel splice mutation in the LAMP2 gene in a French Canadian family. By identifying this novel mutation we were able to offer genetic screening and counseling to all family members. Presymptomatic diagnosis is important as cardiac surveillance can be life-saving.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency is an inborn mitochondrial fatty-acid beta-oxidation (FAO) defect associated with a broad mutational spectrum, with phenotypes ranging from fatal cardiopathy in infancy to adolescent-onset myopathy, and for which there is no established treatment. Recent data suggest that bezafibrate could improve the FAO capacities in beta-oxidation-deficient cells, by enhancing the residual level of mutant enzyme activity via gene-expression stimulation. Since VLCAD-deficient patients frequently harbor missense mutations with unpredictable effects on enzyme activity, we investigated the response to bezafibrate as a function of genotype in 33 VLCAD-deficient fibroblasts representing 45 different mutations. Treatment with bezafibrate (400 microM for 48 h) resulted in a marked increase in FAO capacities, often leading to restoration of normal values, for 21 genotypes that mainly corresponded to patients with the myopathic phenotype. In contrast, bezafibrate induced no changes in FAO for 11 genotypes corresponding to severe neonatal or infantile phenotypes. This pattern of response was not due to differential inductions of VLCAD messenger RNA, as shown by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, but reflected variable increases in measured VLCAD residual enzyme activity in response to bezafibrate. Genotype cross-analysis allowed the identification of alleles carrying missense mutations, which could account for these different pharmacological profiles and, on this basis, led to the characterization of 9 mild and 11 severe missense mutations. Altogether, the responses to bezafibrate reflected the severity of the metabolic blockage in various genotypes, which appeared to be correlated with the phenotype, thus providing a new approach for analysis of genetic heterogeneity. Finally, this study emphasizes the potential of bezafibrate, a widely prescribed hypolipidemic drug, for the correction of VLCAD deficiency and exemplifies the integration of molecular information in a therapeutic strategy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Choreoacanthocytosis (CHAC) (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man accession No. 200150) is a hereditary neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by movement disorders, cognitive decline, myopathy, behavioral changes, and acanthocytosis and is caused by mutations in the VPS13A gene. OBJECTIVE: To describe the cases of 2 Mexican women with clinical and molecular characteristics compatible with CHAC. DESIGN: Case reports. Patients Choreoacanthocytosis was identified in 2 Mexican mestizo sisters with healthy consanguineous parents. Clinical manifestations began at different ages. RESULTS: The onset of signs and symptoms of CHAC in the proband was at age 32 years and was characterized by balancing problems followed by chorea, compulsive lip and tongue biting with buccolingual self-mutilation, dysarthria, dysphagia, and weight loss. The first clinical manifestations in the proband's sister occurred at age 45 years and included multiple motor and verbal tics, with coprolalia, followed by lip and tongue biting, self-mutilation, and chorea. The clinical findings in both sisters were remarkable for acanthocytosis that developed late, when neurologic changes were already evident. Mutation screening of the VPS13A gene revealed homozygosity for the frameshift mutation c.3556_3557dupAC in exon 33. Currently, the proband's sister, in whom neurologic defects developed 13 years after onset of CHAC in the proband, is the least affected. CONCLUSIONS: The same mutation of the VPS13A gene can be expressed differently in the same family. This observation confirms the notion that there is considerable heterogeneity in the clinical manifestation of CHAC.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The detailed process of how dystrophic muscles are replaced by fibrotic tissues is unknown. In the present study, the immunolocalization and mRNA expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in muscles from normal and dystrophic human muscles were examined with the goal of elucidating the pathophysiological function of CTGF in muscular dystrophy. Biopsies of frozen muscle from patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Becker muscular dystrophy, congenital muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, congenital myopathy were analyzed using anti-CTGF polyclonal antibody. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was also performed to evaluate the expression of CTGF mRNA in dystrophic muscles. In normal muscle, neuromuscular junctions and vessels were CTGF-immunopositive, which suggests a physiological role for CTGF in these sites. In dystrophic muscle, CTGF immunoreactivity was localized to muscle fiber basal lamina, regenerating fibers, and the interstitium. Triple immunolabeling revealed that activated fibroblasts were immunopositive for CTGF and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). RT-PCR analysis revealed increased levels of CTGF mRNA in the muscles of DMD patients. Co-localization of TGF-beta1 and CTGF in activated fibroblasts suggests that CTGF expression is regulated by TGF-beta1 through a paracrine/autocrine mechanism. In conclusion, TGF-beta1-CTGF pathway may play a role in the fibrosis that is commonly observed in muscular dystrophy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, and are widely used to treat hypercholesterolemia. These drugs can lead to a number of side effects in muscle, including muscle fiber breakdown; however, the mechanisms of muscle injury by statins are poorly understood. We report that lovastatin induced the expression of atrogin-1, a key gene involved in skeletal muscle atrophy, in humans with statin myopathy, in zebrafish embryos, and in vitro in murine skeletal muscle cells. In cultured mouse myotubes, atrogin-1 induction following lovastatin treatment was accompanied by distinct morphological changes, largely absent in atrogin-1 null cells. In zebrafish embryos, lovastatin promoted muscle fiber damage, an effect that was closely mimicked by knockdown of zebrafish HMG-CoA reductase. Moreover, atrogin-1 knockdown in zebrafish embryos prevented lovastatin-induced muscle injury. Finally, overexpression of PGC-1alpha, a transcriptional coactivator that induces mitochondrial biogenesis and protects against the development of muscle atrophy, dramatically prevented lovastatin-induced muscle damage and abrogated atrogin-1 induction both in fish and in cultured mouse myotubes. Collectively, our human, animal, and in vitro findings shed light on the molecular mechanism of statin-induced myopathy and suggest that atrogin-1 may be a critical mediator of the muscle damage induced by statins.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Intermediate filaments, composed of desmin and of keratins, play important roles in linking contractile elements to each other and to the sarcolemma in striated muscle. We examined the contractile properties and morphology of fast-twitch skeletal muscle from mice lacking keratin 19. Tibialis anterior muscles of keratin-19-null mice showed a small but significant decrease in mean fiber diameter and in the specific force of tetanic contraction, as well as increased plasma creatine kinase levels. Costameres at the sarcolemma of keratin-19-null muscle, visualized with antibodies against spectrin or dystrophin, were disrupted and the sarcolemma was separated from adjacent myofibrils by a large gap in which mitochondria accumulated. The costameric dystrophin-dystroglycan complex, which co-purified with gamma-actin, keratin 8 and keratin 19 from striated muscles of wild-type mice, co-purified with gamma-actin but not keratin 8 in the mutant. Our results suggest that keratin 19 in fast-twitch skeletal muscle helps organize costameres and links them to the contractile apparatus, and that the absence of keratin 19 disrupts these structures, resulting in loss of contractile force, altered distribution of mitochondria and mild myopathy. This is the first demonstration of a mammalian phenotype associated with a genetic perturbation of keratin 19.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The organisation of structural proteins in muscle into highly ordered sarcomeres occurs during development, regeneration and focal repair of skeletal muscle fibers. The involvement of cytoskeletal proteins in this process has been documented, with nonmuscle gamma-actin found to play a role in sarcomere assembly during muscle differentiation and also shown to be up-regulated in dystrophic muscles which undergo regeneration and repair [Lloyd et al.,2004; Hanft et al.,2006]. Here, we show that a cytoskeletal tropomyosin (Tm), Tm4, defines actin filaments in two novel compartments in muscle fibers: a Z-line associated cytoskeleton (Z-LAC), similar to a structure we have reported previously [Kee et al.,2004], and longitudinal filaments that are orientated parallel to the sarcomeric apparatus, present during myofiber growth and repair/regeneration. Tm4 is upregulated in paradigms of muscle repair including induced regeneration and focal repair and in muscle diseases with repair/regeneration features, muscular dystrophy and nemaline myopathy. Longitudinal Tm4-defined filaments also are present in diseased muscle. Transition of the Tm4-defined filaments from a longitudinal to a Z-LAC orientation is observed during the course of muscle regeneration. This Tm4-defined cytoskeleton is a marker of growth and repair/regeneration in response to injury, disease state and stress in skeletal muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The myogenic determination genes Myf5, Myod and Mrf4 direct skeletal muscle cell fate prenatally. In adult myogenesis, Myod has been shown to regulate myoblast differentiation, however, our understanding of satellite cell regulation is incomplete since the roles of Myf5 and Mrf4 had not been clearly defined. Here we examine the function of Myf5 and Mrf4 in the adult using recently generated alleles. Mrf4 is not expressed in normal or Myf5 null satellite cells and myoblasts, therefore excluding a role for this determination gene in adult muscle progenitors. Skeletal muscles of adult Myf5 null mice exhibit a subtle progressive myopathy. Crucially, adult Myf5 null mice exhibit perturbed muscle regeneration with a significant increase in muscle fibre hypertrophy, delayed differentiation, adipocyte accumulation, and fibrosis after freeze-injury. Satellite cell numbers are not significantly altered in Myf5 null animals and they show a modest impaired proliferation under some conditions in vitro. Mice double mutant for Myf5 and Dystrophin were more severely affected than single mutants, with enhanced necrosis and regeneration. Therefore, we show that Myf5 is a regulator of regenerative myogenesis and homeostasis, with functions distinct from those of Myod and Mrf4.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I (LGMD2I) is due to mutations in the fukutin-related protein gene (FKRP), encoding a putative glycosyltransferase involved in alpha-dystroglycan processing. To further characterize the molecular pathogenesis of LGMD2I, we conducted a histological, immunohistochemical, ultrastructural and molecular analysis of ten muscle biopsies from patients with molecularly diagnosed LGMD2I. Hypoglycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan was observed in all FKRP-mutated patients. Muscle histopathology was consistent with either severe muscular dystrophy or myopathy with a mild inflammatory response consisting of up-regulation of class I major histocompatibility complex in skeletal muscle fibers and small foci of mononuclear cells. At the ultrastructural level, muscle fibers showed focal thinning of basal lamina and swollen endoplasmic reticulum cisternae with membrane re-arrangement. The pathways of the unfolded protein response (UPR; glucose-regulated protein 78 and CHOP) were significantly activated in LGMD2I muscle tissue. Our data suggest that the UPR response is activated in LGMD2I muscle biopsies, and the observed histopathological and ultrastructural alterations may be related to sarcoplasmic structures involved in FKRP and alpha-dystroglycan metabolism and malfunctioning.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD, OMIM 167320) has recently been attributed to eight missense mutations in valosin-containing protein (VCP). We report novel VCP mutations N387H and L198W in six individuals from two families who presented with proximal muscle weakness at a mean age of diagnosis of 40 years, most losing the ability to walk within a few years of onset. Electromyographic studies in four individuals were suggestive of 'myopathic' changes, and neuropathic pattern was identified in one individual in family 1. Muscle biopsy in four individuals showed myopathic changes characterized by variable fiber size, two individuals showing rimmed vacuoles and IBM-type cytoplasmic inclusions in muscle fibers, and electron microscopy in one individual revealing abundant intranuclear inclusions. Frontotemporal dementia associated with characteristic behavioral changes including short-term memory loss, language difficulty, and antisocial behavior was observed in three individuals at a mean age of 47 years. Detailed brain pathology in one individual showed cortical degenerative changes, most severe in the temporal lobe and hippocampus. Abundant ubiquitin-positive tau-, alpha-synuclein-, polyglutamine repeat-negative neuronal intranuclear inclusions and only rare intracytoplasmic VCP positive inclusions were seen. These new mutations may cause structural changes in VCP and provide some insight into the functional effects of pathogenic mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report four heterozygous dynamin 2 (DNM2) mutations in five centronuclear myopathy patients aged 1 to 15 years. They all presented with neonatal hypotonia with weak suckling. Thereafter, their phenotype progressively improved. All patients demonstrated muscle weakness prominent in the lower limbs, and most of them also presented with facial weakness, open mouth, arched palate, ptosis, and ophthalmoparesis. Electrophysiology showed only myopathic changes, and muscle biopsies showed central nuclei and type 1 fiber hypotrophy and predominance. Our results expand the phenotypic spectrum of dynamin 2-related centronuclear myopathy from the classic mild form to the more severe neonatal phenotype.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Muscle fiber inexcitability and myosin loss underlie weakness in critical illness myopathy (CIM). Nitric oxide (NO) takes part in the maintenance of muscle fiber resting potential and, in pathological conditions accompanied by oxidative stress, may damage proteins through peroxynitrite generation. Sepsis and other conditions associated with CIM may differentially affect expression of NO synthases (NOSs), so that both downregulation and upregulation with excessive peroxynitrite production can be hypothesized. In six patients with CIM we studied NOS1, NOS2, and NOS3 protein expression by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. To investigate peroxynitrite production, we performed immunohistochemistry for nitrotyrosine and measured nitrotyrosine levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In three patients, sarcolemmal staining for NOS1 was selectively absent. In the others, it was absent in atrophic fibers and absent or reduced in non-atrophic fibers. Total NOS1 protein content was reduced by 41% in patients compared to controls, whereas no significant changes were found in levels and localization of NOS2, NOS3, and nitrotyrosine. Further studies are warranted to determine whether NOS1 loss plays a role in the pathophysiology of CIM, possibly reducing the release of NO at the sarcolemma and affecting muscle fiber excitability.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD, MIM 167320) is a recently identified autosomal dominant disorder due to mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) that affects muscle, bone and brain. Brain involvement and neuropsychological findings of IBMPFD have not been described in detail. A patient carried a novel heterozygous base pair change, 47832C>T, in the VCP gene that resulted in substitution of an arginine residue by cysteine at position 93 (R93C). He presented first with myopathy while bone involvement remained subclinical. The patient developed behavioral abnormalities in his 60s and showed frank personality change with fluent empty speech at the age of 74 years. This syndrome was best classified as semantic dementia. Magnetic resonance imaging disclosed slight but progressive cerebral atrophy with prominent callosal and frontal white matter loss. Positron emission tomography demonstrated glucose hypometabolism of the frontal and temporal lobes disproportionate to their structural involvement. This first comprehensive clinical and neuroimaging study in IBMPFD may raise the awareness among clinicians as well as basic scientists for this exemplary genetic model of dementia.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XLCM) was first described in 1987 and associated with dystrophin gene (DMD) mutations a decade later in one of the original two families. Here we report long-term follow-up of the second family (XLCM-2), for which a DMD mutation was never found. Analysis of the lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2) gene detected a novel mutation, confirming a diagnosis of Danon disease. The broad phenotype in this family included dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cardiac pre-excitation, skeletal myopathy with high serum creatinine kinase, cognitive impairement (in males), and and a pigmentary retinopathy in affected females. Cardiac biopsy in a 13-month-old mutation-carrying male showed no vacuolization by standard histology. We conclude that XLCM may be the presenting sign of Danon disease and, in the presence of familial history of HCM, pre-excitation, skeletal muscle involvement and retinal pigmentary dystrophy should prompt LAMP-2 clinical testing. Furthermore, the absence of vacuolar myopathy in biopsies from young patients may not exclude Danon disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (IBM) with Paget's disease of the bone (PDB) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a rare autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene. We report a novel heterozygous VCP gene mutation (R159C) in a 69-year-old Italian patient presenting with slowly progressive muscle weakness of the distal upper and proximal lower limbs since the age of 50 years, 18 years later FTD supervened. No dementia or myopathies were revealed in the family history covering two generations. Degenerative changes and rimmed vacuoles together with VCP- and ubiquitin-positive cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates were observed at the muscle biopsy. Several elements support the pathogenic role of the R159C VCP gene mutation: the occurrence at the same codon of a different, previously identified pathogenic mutation within a VCP gene mutational hot-spot, the histopathological and biochemical evidence of muscle VCP accumulation and the combined clinical presentation of IBM and FTD. These findings suggest VCP gene investigation even in apparently sporadic cases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Small Heat Shock Proteins (sHSPs) have important roles in preventing disease and promoting resistance to environmental stressors. Mutations in any one of a number of sHSPs, including HSP27 (HSPB1), HSP22 (HSPB8), alphaA-crystallin (HSPB4), or alphaB-crystallin (HSPB5) can result in neuronal degeneration, myopathy, and/or cataract in humans. Ten sHSPs are known in humans, and thirteen have been identified in teleost fish. Here we report the identification of thirteen zebrafish sHSPs. Using a combination of phylogenetic analysis and analysis of synteny, we have determined that ten are likely orthologs of human sHSPs. We have used quantitative RT-PCR to determine the relative expression levels of all thirteen sHSPs during development and in response to heat shock. Our findings indicate that most of the zebrafish sHSPs are expressed during development, and five of these genes are transcriptionally upregulated by heat shock at one or more stages of development.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Dominant mutations in the three collagen VI genes cause Bethlem myopathy, a disorder characterized by proximal muscle weakness and commonly contractures of the fingers, wrists, and ankles. Although more than 20 different dominant mutations have been identified in Bethlem myopathy patients, the biosynthetic consequences of only a subset of these have been studied, and in many cases, the pathogenic mechanisms remain unknown. METHODS: We have screened fourteen Bethlem myopathy patients for collagen VI mutations and performed detailed analyses of collagen VI biosynthesis and intracellular and extracellular assembly. RESULTS: Collagen VI abnormalities were identified in eight patients. One patient produced around half the normal amount of alpha1(VI) messenger RNA and reduced amounts of collagen VI protein. Two patients had a previously reported mutation causing skipping of COL6A1 exon 14, and three patients had novel mutations leading to in-frame deletions toward the N-terminal end of the triple-helical domain. These mutations have different and complex effects on collagen VI intracellular and extracellular assembly. Two patients had single amino acid substitutions in the A-domains of COL6A2 and COL6A3. Collagen VI intracellular and extracellular assembly was normal in one of these patients. INTERPRETATION: The key to dissecting the pathogenic mechanisms of collagen VI mutations lies in detailed analysis of collagen VI biosynthesis and assembly. The majority of mutations result in secretion and deposition of structurally abnormal collagen VI. However, one A-domain mutation had no detectable effect on assembly, suggesting that it acts by compromising collagen VI interactions in the extracellular matrix of muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The S143F lamin A/C point mutation causes a phenotype combining features of myopathy and progeria. We demonstrate here that patient dermal fibroblast cells have dysmorphic nuclei containing numerous blebs and lobulations, which progressively accumulate as cells age in culture. The lamin A/C organization is altered, showing intranuclear and nuclear envelope (NE) aggregates and presenting often a honeycomb appearance. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that nesprin-2 C-terminal isoforms and LAP2alpha were recovered in the cytoplasm, whereas LAP2beta and emerin were unevenly localized along the NE. In addition, the intranuclear organization of acetylated histones, histone H1 and the active form of RNA polymerase II were markedly different in patient cells. A subpopulation of mutant cells, however, expressing the 800 kDa nesprin-2 giant isoform, did not show an overt nuclear phenotype. Ectopic expression of p.S143F lamin A in fibroblasts recapitulates the patient cell phenotype, whereas no effects were observed in p.S143F LMNA keratinocytes, which highly express nesprin-2 giant. Overexpression of the mutant lamin A protein had a more severe impact on the NE of nesprin-2 giant deficient fibroblasts when compared with wild-type. In summary, our results suggest that the p.S143F lamin A mutation affects NE architecture and composition, chromatin organization, gene expression and transcription. Furthermore, our findings implicate a direct involvement of the nesprins in laminopathies and propose nesprin-2 giant as a structural reinforcer at the NE.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVES: Recent studies indicate that Notch3 gene mutations not only manifest as cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) but also in the peripheral nerves and skeletal muscles. METHODS: A MEDLINE search with appropriate terms was carried out. Six articles, dealing with neuromuscular involvement in CADASIL, were selected and reviewed. RESULTS: Several case studies presented CADASIL patients with clinical features of myopathy. Neurological diagnostic workup in these patients revealed weakness, wasting, reduced/exaggerated tendon reflexes, abnormal nerve conduction and electromyography, muscle biopsy with ragged red muscle fibers, reduced COX staining, decreased complex I respiratory chain activity, abnormally structured mitochondria, or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, such as G5650A in the tRNAAla gene, or various other mtDNA substitutions. Additionally, fibroblasts in skin biopsy may show reduced complex V respiratory chain activity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest Notch3 mutations to be associated with mitochondrial disease, particularly affecting the skeletal muscle. Whether mtDNA mutations were induced by Notch3 mutations, by oxidative stress due to chronic hypoxia, resulting from arteriopathy, or occurred spontaneously remains elusive. Patients carrying Notch3 mutations should be systematically investigated for neuromuscular involvement, which may have therapeutic and prognostic implications for these patients.</rdfs:comment>

Acid maltase activity of the muscle was normal, but the biopsied muscle specimen stained for lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2), which has recently been reported to be deficient in muscles of patients with Danon disease. The clinical features of the patient are distinct from X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy, infantile autophagic vacuolar myopathy and autophagic vacuolar myopathy with late-onset and multiorgan involvement (Kaneda).</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Miyoshi myopathy (MM) is an autosomal recessive distal muscular dystrophy characterized by mutations of the dysferlin gene. Although several pairs of homozygous/heterozygous mutations have been reported, few effective treatments of MM are available. We had observed the decreased serum creatine kinase (CK) before and after administration of dantrolene in the elder brother and the increased serum CK before and after discontinuance of the drug on suspicion of drug-induced hepatopathy in the younger sister. We report a novel pair of heterozygous mutations in the 3'-splicing site of exon 26 and the translation site of exon 28 of the dysferlin gene in two siblings, and effective treatment of their MM with dantrolene.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Dysfunction of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) has been recently recognized as an important cause of inherited neurodegenerative diseases. We have reported dominant and recessive inheritance of parkinsonism, mitochondrial myopathy, and premature amenorrhea in five ethnically distinct families with POLG1 mutations. This prompted us to carry out a detailed analysis of the coding region and intron-exon boundaries of POLG1 in Finnish patients with idiopathic sporadic Parkinson disease (PD) and in nonparkinsonian controls. METHODS: The coding region of POLG1 was analyzed in 140 Finnish patients with PD and their 127 spouses as age- and ethnically matched controls. Further, we analyzed the intragenic CAG-repeat region of POLG1 in 126 additional patients with nonparkinsonian neurologic disorders and in 516 Finnish population controls. RESULTS: We found clustering of rare variants of the POLG1 CAG-repeat, encoding a polyglutamine tract, in Finnish patients with idiopathic PD as compared to their spouses (p = 0.003; OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.35 to 6.71), population controls (p = 0.001; OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.45 to 4.14), and patients with nonparkinsonian neurologic disorders (p = 0.05, OR 1.98, 95% CI 0.97 to 4.05). We found several amino acid substitutions, none of them associating with PD. These included a previously parkinsonism-associated POLG variant Y831C, found in one patient with PD, but also in five controls, suggesting that it is a neutral amino acid polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that POLG polyglutamine tract variants should be considered as a predisposing genetic factor in idiopathic sporadic Parkinson disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlin encoding gene (DYS) is mutated in the autosomal recessive disorders Miyoshi myopathy, Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) and distal anterior compartment myopathy, causing dysferlin deficiency in muscle biopsy. Three ethnic clusters have previously been described in Dysferlinopathy: the Libyan Jewish population originating in the area of Tripoli, Italian and Spanish populations. We report another cluster of this muscular dystrophy in Israel among Jews of the Caucasus region. A genomic analysis of the dysferlin coding sequence performed in patients from this ethnic group, who demonstrated an absence of dysferlin expression in muscle biopsy, revealed a homozygous frameshift mutation of G deletion at codon 927 (2779delG) predicting a truncated protein and a complete loss of functional protein. The possible existence of a founder effect is strengthened by our finding of a 4% carrier frequency in this community. These findings are important for genetic counseling and also enable a molecular diagnosis of LGMD2B in Jews of the Caucasus region.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2), an ubiquitously-expressed large GTPase, cause autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy (DNM2-CNM) and AD Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B (DNM2-CMT2B). We report a series of 5 patients from the same family who all presented with dominant centronuclear myopathy, mild cognitive impairment, mild axonal peripheral nerve involvement, and the novel E368Q mutation in the DNM2 gene. This study suggests that the phenotypes of dynamin 2 related centronuclear myopathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease overlap and that DNM2 mutations may alter cerebral function. This report extends the clinical knowledge of DNM2-centronuclear myopathy and shows that the role of DNM2 mutations in the central nervous system should be further studied.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Maintenance of skeletal and cardiac muscle structure and function requires precise control of the synthesis, assembly, and turnover of contractile proteins of the sarcomere. Abnormalities in accumulation of sarcomere proteins are responsible for a variety of myopathies. However, the mechanisms that mediate turnover of these long-lived proteins remain poorly defined. We show that muscle RING finger 1 (MuRF1) and MuRF3 act as E3 ubiquitin ligases that cooperate with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UbcH5a, -b, and -c to mediate the degradation of beta/slow myosin heavy chain (beta/slow MHC) and MHCIIa via the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in vivo and in vitro. Accordingly, mice deficient for MuRF1 and MuRF3 develop a skeletal muscle myopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy characterized by subsarcolemmal MHC accumulation, myofiber fragmentation, and diminished muscle performance. These findings identify MuRF1 and MuRF3 as key E3 ubiquitin ligases for the UPS-dependent turnover of sarcomeric proteins and reveal a potential basis for myosin storage myopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations of the valosin-containing protein gene (VCP) are responsible for autosomal-dominant hereditary inclusion-body myopathy associated with frontotemporal dementia and Paget's disease of bone. We identified the p.R155C missense mutation in the VCP gene segregating in an Italian family with three affected siblings, two of whom had a progressive myopathy associated with dementia, whereas one exhibited a progressive myopathy and preclinical signs of Paget's disease of bone. Our study demonstrates that VCP mutations are found in patients of Italian background and may lead to a variable clinical phenotype even within the same kinship.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Desmin-related myopathy is characterised by skeletal muscle weakness often combined with cardiac involvement. Mutations in the desmin gene have been described as a cause of desmin-related myopathy (OMIM 601419). We report here on two distantly related Dutch families with autosomal dominant inheritance of desmin-related myopathy affecting 15 family members. A highly heterogeneous clinical picture is apparent, varying from isolated dilated cardiomyopathy to a more generalised skeletal myopathy and mild respiratory problems. Morphological analysis of muscle biopsies revealed intracytoplasmic desmin aggregates (desmin and p62 staining). In both families we identified an identical novel pathogenic heterozygous missense mutation, S13F, in the 'head' domain of the desmin gene which cosegregates with the disease phenotype. This is the 5th reported missense mutation located at the 'head' domain of the desmin gene and the first reported Dutch family with desmin-related myopathy. This article illustrates the importance of analysing the desmin gene in patients with (familial) cardiac conduction disease, dilated cardiomyopathy and/or a progressive skeletal myopathy resembling limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the alpha-skeletal actin gene (ACTA1) result in a variety of inherited muscle disorders characterized by different pathologies and variable clinical phenotypes. Mutations at Val163 in ACTA1 result in pure intranuclear rod myopathy; however, the molecular mechanisms by which mutations at Val163 lead to intranuclear rod formation and muscle weakness are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated the effects of the Val163Met mutation in ACTA1 in tissue culture and Drosophila models, and in patient muscle. In cultured cells, the mutant actin tends to aggregate rather than incorporate into cytoplasmic microfilaments, and it affects the dynamics of wild-type actin, causing it to accumulate with the mutant actin in the nucleus. In Drosophila, the Val163Met mutation severely disrupts the structure of the muscle sarcomere. The intranuclear aggregates in patient muscle biopsies impact on nuclear structure and sequester normal Z-disc-associated proteins within the nucleus; however, the sarcomeric structure is relatively well preserved, with evidence of active regeneration. By mass spectrometry, the levels of mutant protein are markedly reduced in patient muscle compared with control. INTERPRETATION: Data from our tissue culture and Drosophila models show that the Val163Met mutation in alpha-skeletal actin can affect the dynamics of other actin isoforms and severely disrupt sarcomeric structure, processes that can contribute to muscle weakness. However, in human muscle, there is evidence of regeneration, and the mutant protein tends to aggregate rather than incorporate into cytoplasmic microfilaments in cells. These are likely compensatory processes that ameliorate the effects of the mutant actin and contribute to the milder clinical and pathological disease phenotype.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV) or hereditary inclusion body myopathy (hIBM) is an early adult-onset distal myopathy caused by mutations in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene which encodes for a bifunctional enzyme involved in sialic acid biosynthesis. It is pathologically characterized by the presence of rimmed vacuoles (RVs), especially in atrophic fibers, which also occasionally contain congophilic materials that are immunoreactive to beta-amyloid, lysosomal proteins, ubiquitin and tau proteins. To elucidate the pathomechanism of this myopathy and to explore treatment options, we generated a mouse model of DMRV/hIBM. We knocked out the Gne gene in mice but this resulted in embryonic lethality. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse that expressed the human GNE D176V mutation, which is one of the most prevalent mutations among Japanese DMRV patients, and crossed this with Gne(+/-) mice to obtain Gne(-/-)hGNED176V-Tg. Interestingly, these mice exhibit marked hyposialylation in serum, muscle and other organs. Reduction in motor performance in these mice can only be seen from 30 weeks of age. A compelling finding is the development of beta-amyloid deposition in myofibers by 32 weeks, which clearly precedes RV formation at 42 weeks. These results show that the Gne(-/-)hGNED176V-Tg mouse mimics the clinical, histopathological and biochemical features of DMRV/hIBM, making it useful for understanding the pathomechanism of this myopathy and for employing different strategies for therapy. Our findings underscore the notion that hyposialylation plays an important role in the pathomechanism of DMRV/hIBM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) is a key integrator of neuromuscular activity in skeletal muscle. Ectopic expression of PGC-1alpha in muscle results in increased mitochondrial number and function as well as an increase in oxidative, fatigue-resistant muscle fibers. Whole body PGC-1alpha knock-out mice have a very complex phenotype but do not have a marked skeletal muscle phenotype. We thus analyzed skeletal muscle-specific PGC-1alpha knock-out mice to identify a specific role for PGC-1alpha in skeletal muscle function. These mice exhibit a shift from oxidative type I and IIa toward type IIx and IIb muscle fibers. Moreover, skeletal muscle-specific PGC-1alpha knock-out animals have reduced endurance capacity and exhibit fiber damage and elevated markers of inflammation following treadmill running. Our data demonstrate a critical role for PGC-1alpha in maintenance of normal fiber type composition and of muscle fiber integrity following exertion.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in GNE encoding UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) cause hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM). To define the role of GNE mutations in HIBM pathogenesis, GNE protein expression was analyzed. GNE protein is expressed at equal levels in HIBM patients and normal control subjects. Immunofluorescence detection of GNE did not reveal any mislocalization of GNE in skeletal muscle. We conclude that impaired GNE function, not lack of expression, may be the key pathogenic factor in HIBM. For diagnostic purposes, direct genetic analysis of the GNE gene in patients with IBM will remain the mainstay and is not aided by immunohistochemistry or immunoblotting using antibodies against the GNE protein.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical phenotype of an autosomal-dominant pedigree with myotilinopathy. METHODS: Two symptomatic patients and six asymptomatic gene mutation carriers were examined. We performed serum chemistry, electrophysiological assessments, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of lower limb musculature, histochemical and immunohistochemical studies of a muscle biopsy and mutation analysis of the myotilin gene. RESULTS: Both symptomatic patients, aged 76 and 61 years, presented with late-onset, distal lower-limb weakness involving the ankle and toe flexo-extensor muscles extending up to the thigh muscles; there was mild weakness of the intrinsic hand musculature in the eldest patient. Electromyography revealed a myopathic pattern. Serum creatine kinase levels were slightly elevated. Muscle biopsy revealed myopathic changes with myotilin- and desmin-positive aggregates. Gene sequencing identified a myotilin S55F mutation. In both patients, MRI showed moderate to severe fatty atrophy of all four leg muscle compartments, extending up to the thigh musculature, mainly involving the biceps, femoris, semimembranosus, vasti and glutei muscles; intrinsic foot musculature was involved but to a lesser degree. In all six gene mutation carriers, aged from 21 to 63 years, clinical examinations showed no myopathic signs. MRI was normal in the youngest individual, whereas in the remaining five individuals the outstanding finding was fatty infiltration of the soleus muscles. CONCLUSIONS: Myotilin S55F mutations may cause a clinically distinct autosomal-dominant late-onset and lower-limb distal myopathic syndrome involving all four leg muscle compartments. MRI helps to reliably depict the topography of fatty muscle atrophy and to detect early leg muscle changes in asymptomatic gene mutation carriers.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Centronuclear myopathies are characterized by muscle weakness and abnormal centralization of nuclei in muscle fibers not secondary to regeneration. The severe neonatal X-linked form (myotubular myopathy) is due to mutations in the phosphoinositide phosphatase myotubularin (MTM1), whereas mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) have been found in some autosomal dominant cases. By direct sequencing of functional candidate genes, we identified homozygous mutations in amphiphysin 2 (BIN1) in three families with autosomal recessive inheritance. Two missense mutations affecting the BAR (Bin1/amphiphysin/RVS167) domain disrupt its membrane tubulation properties in transfected cells, and a partial truncation of the C-terminal SH3 domain abrogates the interaction with DNM2 and its recruitment to the membrane tubules. Our results suggest that mutations in BIN1 cause centronuclear myopathy by interfering with remodeling of T tubules and/or endocytic membranes, and that the functional interaction between BIN1 and DNM2 is necessary for normal muscle function and positioning of nuclei.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Abnormal connective tissue proliferation following muscle degeneration is a major pathological feature of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a genetic myopathy due to lack of the sarcolemmal dystrophin protein. Since this fibrotic proliferation is likely to be a major obstacle to the efficacy of future therapies, research is needed to understand and prevent the fibrotic process in order to develop an effective treatment. Murine muscular dystrophy (mdx) is genetically homologous to DMD, and histopatological alterations are comparable to those of the muscles of patients with DMD. To investigate the development of fibrosis, we bred the mdx mouse with the scid immunodepressed mouse and analysed fibrosis histologically; we used ELISA analysis to determine TGF-beta1 expression. Significant reduction of fibrosis and TGF-beta1 expression was found in the muscles of the scid/mdx mice. However, we observed similar centrally located nuclei, necrosis, muscle degeneration and muscle force compared to the mdx animals. These data demonstrate a correlation between the absence of B and T lymphocytes and loss of fibrosis accompanied by reduction of TGF-beta1, suggesting the importance of modulation of the immune system in DMD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Recently, mutations in PNPLA2 encoding adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) were reported to underlie a neutral lipid storage disease (NLSD) subgroup characterized by mild myopathy and the absence of ichthyosis. In the present study a novel homozygous PNPLA2 mutation c.475_478dupCTCC (p.Gln160ProfsX19) in the patatin domain, the ATGL active site, was detected in a woman with NLSD and severe myopathy. The present results suggest that a premature truncation mutation in the patatin domain causes NLSD with severe myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The missense mutation Arg-120 to Gly (R120G) in the human alphaBeta-crystallin sequence has been reported to be associated with autosomal dominant myopathy, cardiomyopathy, and cataract. Previous studies of the mutant showed a significant ability to aggregate in cultured cells and an increased oligomeric size coupled to an important loss of the chaperone-like activity in vitro. The aim of this study was to further analyze the role of the R120 residue in the structural and functional properties of alphaBeta-crystallin. The following mutants were generated, Arg-120 to Gly (R120G), Cys (R120C), Lys (R120K), and Asp (R120D). In cellulo, after expression in two cultured cell lines, NIH-3T3 and Cos-7, the capacity of the wild-type and mutant crystallins to aggregate was evaluated and the protein location was determined by immunofluorescence. In vitro, the wild-type and mutant crystallins were expressed in Escherichia coli cells, purified by size exclusion chromatography, and characterized using dynamic light scattering, electron microscopy, and chaperone-like activity assays. Aggregate sizes in cellulo and in vitro were analyzed. The whole of the data showed that the preservation of an Arg residue at position 120 of alphaBeta-crystallin is critical for the structural and functional integrity of the protein and that each mutation results in specific changes in both structural and functional characteristics.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Recently, mutations affecting different domains of dynamin-2 (DNM2) were associated alternatively with autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy or dominant intermediate (demyelinating and axonal) Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) type B. OBJECTIVE: To assess the etiologic role of DNM2 in CMT. METHODS: We performed a mutational screening of DNM2 exons 13 through 16 encoding the pleckstrin homology domain in a large series of CMT patients with a broad range of nerve conduction velocities and without mutations in more common genes. RESULTS: We identified two novel DNM2 mutations that cosegregated with purely axonal CMT in two pedigrees without clinical evidence of primary myopathy. CONCLUSION: Patients with axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 neuropathy without mutations in more common genes should undergo investigation for DNM2 pleckstrin homology.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Several desmin mutations have been described over the past few years in patients with dilated and restrictive cardiomyopathy, often in association with distal myopathy. However, the role of desmin mutations as a cause of various types of cardiomyopathy is still undetermined. The aim of this study was to analyse the frequency of desmin mutations in patients with cardiomyopathy identified and diagnosed in the St. Petersburg area of Russia. We screened 98 patients with dilated, 40 with hypertrophic and 4 with restrictive cardiomyopathy. All exons of the desmin gene were amplified by PCR and studied by sequencing. Two out of 98 patients showed the presence of desmin gene mutations, not previously described in dilated cardiomyopathy. A novel IVS2-2A-->G splice site mutation, presumably causing skipping of exon 3, was detected in a case of familial right ventricular dilated cardiomyopathy. An A213V mutation was associated with a case of late onset dilated cardiomyopathy. No desmin mutations were found in patients with hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathy. Desmin mutations should be considered a relatively rare cause of dilated cardiomyopathy in this specific geographic area.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Inclusion-body myopathy with Paget's disease and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is a disease of muscle, bone, and brain that results from mutations in the gene encoding valosin-containing protein (VCP). The mechanism of disease resulting from VCP mutations is unknown. Previous studies of VCP localization in normal human muscle samples have found a capillary and perinuclear distribution, but not a nuclear localization. Here we demonstrate that VCP is present in both myonuclei and endothelial cell nuclei in normal human muscle tissue. The immunodetection of VCP varies with acetone or paraformaldehyde fixation. Within the nucleus, VCP associates with the nucleolar protein fibrillarin and Werner syndrome protein (Wrnp) in normal and IBMPFD muscle. In patients with inclusion-body myositis (IBM), normal nuclear localization is present and some rimmed vacuoles are lined with VCP. These findings suggest that impairment in the nuclear function of VCP might contribute to the muscle pathology occurring in IBMPFD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotubular myopathy is a well-defined entity within the centronuclear myopathy subgroup of congenital myopathies. The authors present a patient with the most severe X-linked recessive type (XLMTM). A baby boy presented at birth with severe hypotonia, weak spontaneous movements, arthrogryposis, and respiratory insufficiency. Muscle biopsy showed features of myotubular myopathy. The diagnosis was confirmed and further specified by genetic analysis, revealing a novel frameshift mutation (1314-1315insT) of the myotubularin-coding MTM1 gene. This case underlines the importance of interdisciplinary analysis of congenital muscle diseases, including histomorphological and genetic investigations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the gene for valosin containing protein (VCP) cause autosomal dominant inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). To investigate the role of this novel gene in sporadic forms of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), we genotyped 27 single nucleotide polymorphisms covering the entire VCP genomic region in 198 patients with sporadic FTD and 184 matched controls from Germany. No significant association could be demonstrated. There is no evidence, that common variants in VCP confer a strong risk to the development of sporadic FTD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Previous studies showed that nitricoxide synthase (NOS) and oxidative stress can induce skeletal muscle atrophy in the muscular dystrophy and inclusion-body myopathy. There is a correlation between NOS and oxidative stress. However, it is not clear, whether there are some changes of the NOS activity in prolonged alcoholic myopathy (PAM), and whether NOS activity has relation to amyotrophy of PAM. We established experimental alcoholic myopathy model of rats by prolonged alcohol intake. We found that there is a reduction in GSH-px (P &lt; 0.05) and an increase of SOD (P &lt; 0.05), MDA (P &lt; 0.05) and iNOS (P &lt; 0.05) in the plantaris of the experimental group by spectrophotometer. In the soleus of the experimental group, except for MDA showed an increase (P &lt; 0.05), the other enzymes showed no obvious difference (P > 0.05). The immunohistochemistry results showed that there was obvious expression of iNOS in the cytoplasm of plantaris in the experimental group and there was no expression of iNOS in the control group. There was a decrease of nNOS expression on the membranes of the plantaris cells in the experimental group by immunofluorescence. Meanwhile, we found the expression of nNOS in some cytoplasm. Our results suggested that NOS might be an important factor during the development of PAM. We could infer that there are some disturbances with regard to output and scavenging of free radical in PAM. Alcohol can induce the oxidative stress reaction and further result in imbalance of the oxidant-antioxidant status in the organism.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Wild-type zebrafish embryos swim away in response to tactile stimulation. By contrast, relatively relaxed mutants swim slowly due to weak contractions of trunk muscles. Electrophysiological recordings from muscle showed that output from the CNS was normal in mutants, suggesting a defect in the muscle. Calcium imaging revealed that Ca(2+) transients were reduced in mutant fast muscle. Immunostaining demonstrated that ryanodine and dihydropyridine receptors, which are responsible for Ca(2+) release following membrane depolarization, were severely reduced at transverse-tubule/sarcoplasmic reticulum junctions in mutant fast muscle. Thus, slow swimming is caused by weak muscle contractions due to impaired excitation-contraction coupling. Indeed, most of the ryanodine receptor 1b (ryr1b) mRNA in mutants carried a nonsense mutation that was generated by aberrant splicing due to a DNA insertion in an intron of the ryr1b gene, leading to a hypomorphic condition in relatively relaxed mutants. RYR1 mutations in humans lead to a congenital myopathy, multi-minicore disease (MmD), which is defined by amorphous cores in muscle. Electron micrographs showed minicore structures in mutant fast muscles. Furthermore, following the introduction of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides that restored the normal splicing of ryr1b, swimming was recovered in mutants. These findings suggest that zebrafish relatively relaxed mutants may be useful for understanding the development and physiology of MmD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Autophagy is a major pathway for delivery of proteins and organelles to lysosomes where they are degraded and recycled. We have previously shown excessive autophagy in a mouse model of Pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type II), a devastating myopathy caused by a deficiency of the glycogen-degrading lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase. The autophagic buildup constituted a major pathological component in skeletal muscle and interfered with delivery of the therapeutic enzyme. To assess the role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of the human disease, we have analyzed vesicles of the lysosomal-degradative pathway in isolated single muscle fibers from Pompe patients. Human myofibers showed abundant autophagosome formation and areas of autophagic buildup of a wide range of sizes. In patients, as in the mouse model, the enormous autophagic buildup causes greater skeletal muscle damage than the enlarged, glycogenfilled lysosomes outside the autophagic regions. Clearing or preventing autophagic buildup seems, therefore, a necessary target of Pompe disease therapy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To investigate haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene, in UK Caucasian idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional, case-control study of four TNF-alpha SNPs was undertaken, comparing cases of polymyositis (PM) (n = 121), dermatomyositis (DM) (n = 109) and myositis overlapping with other connective tissue diseases (CTD-overlap) (n = 73) with normal subjects (n = 177). Subgroup analyses were undertaken after stratifying for myositis specific/associated antibodies. RESULTS: The TNF-308A allele demonstrated a strong association with each myositis disease subgroup vs controls [PM, odds ratio (OR) 2.8, 95% confidence interval 1.9-4.3; DM, OR 2.5, 1.6-3.8; CTD-overlap, OR 3.3, 2.1-5.1]. The TNF-308GA/AA genotype frequency was significantly increased vs controls (PM, OR 3.7, 2.1-6.3; DM, OR 3.2, 1.8-5.5; CTD-overlap, OR 5.0, 2.6-9.6) suggesting a dominant model. The association was strongest in patients possessing anti-aminoacyl transfer RNA synthetase (anti-synthetase) (OR 5.1, 3.3-8.0) or -PM-Scl (OR 5.0, 2.7-8.9) antibodies. The -1031T allele was also a significant risk factor in DM (OR 2.2, 1.4-3.6), anti-synthetase (OR 2.9, 1.6-5.3) and -PM-Scl (OR 5.6, 1.9-6.4) antibody positive patients. The TNF-308A association was lost after adjusting for HLA-B*08, but remained independent of HLA-DQB1*02 (both are alleles forming part of the common ancestral haplotype). The HLA-B*08/TNF-308A/DRB1*03/DQA1*05/DQB1*02 haplotype was a risk factor in all myositis subgroups vs controls (OR 3.0, 1.8-5.3). CONCLUSIONS: TNF-308A and -1031T alleles are significant risk factors in the IIMs. In the IIMs, the TNF-308A allele is part of the common ancestral haplotype, but is not independent of HLA-B*08.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>UNLABELLED: Organic cation/carnitine transporters transport carnitine, drugs, and xenobiotics (e.g. choline, acetylcarnitine, betaine, valproic acid), and are expressed in muscle, heart, blood vessels, kidney, gut, etc. OBJECTIVE: To characterize expression patterns of mOctn1, -2 and -3 in murine brain. METHODS: We applied our transporter-specific antibodies to mOctn1, -2 and -3, followed by 2 0 antibody and DAB peroxidase detection to serial adult murine brain sections counterstained with hematoxylin. RESULTS: All three transporters showed strong expression in the external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb and in olfactory nerve, the molecular layer and neuronal processes of input fibres extending vertically in motor cortex, in the dendritic arborization of the cornu ammonis and dendate gyrus (hippocampus), neuronal processes in the arcuate nucleus (hypothalamus), choroid plexus cells, and neuronal cell bodies and dendrites of cranial nerve nuclei V and VII. In the cerebellum, all three transporters were strongly expressed in dendritic processes of Purkinje cells, but Octn1 and -2 were expressed more strongly than Octn3 in Purkinje cell bodies. In spinal cord, Octn1, -2 and -3 were prominent in axons and dendritic end-arborizations of spinal cord neurons in both ascending and descending white matter tracts, whereas Octn3 was also strongly expressed in grey matter, specifically in anterior horn cell bodies. Octn3 was weakly expressed in glomerular layer neuronal cell bodies of olfactory bulb. CONCLUSIONS: hOCTN2 deficiency presents with carnitine-responsive cardiomyopathy, myopathy and hypoglycemic, hypoketotic coma with strokes, seizures and delays. In mouse, Octn1, -2 and -3 are expressed in many regions throughout the central nervous system with a pattern suggestive of roles in modulating cerebral bioenergetics and in acetylcholine generation for neurotransmission in olfactory, satiety, limbic, memory, motor and sensory functions. This distribution may play a role in the pattern of neurological injury that occurs in hOCTN2 deficiency during catabolic episodes of hypoglycemic, hypoketotic encephalopathy and which may manifest with cognitive impairment, hypotonia and seizures.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the key enzyme of sialic acid biosynthesis, uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) kinase (GNE/MNK), result in hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM), an adult-onset, progressive neuromuscular disorder. We created knockin mice harboring the M712T Gne/Mnk mutation. Homozygous mutant (Gne(M712T/M712T)) mice did not survive beyond P3. At P2, significantly decreased Gne-epimerase activity was observed in Gne(M712T/M712T) muscle, but no myopathic features were apparent. Rather, homozygous mutant mice had glomerular hematuria, proteinuria, and podocytopathy. Renal findings included segmental splitting of the glomerular basement membrane, effacement of podocyte foot processes, and reduced sialylation of the major podocyte sialoprotein, podocalyxin. ManNAc administration yielded survival beyond P3 in 43% of the Gne(M712T/M712T) pups. Survivors exhibited improved renal histology, increased sialylation of podocalyxin, and increased Gne/Mnk protein expression and Gne-epimerase activities. These findings establish this Gne(M712T/M712T) knockin mouse as what we believe to be the first genetic model of podocyte injury and segmental glomerular basement membrane splitting due to hyposialylation. The results also support evaluation of ManNAc as a treatment not only for HIBM but also for renal disorders involving proteinuria and hematuria due to podocytopathy and/or segmental splitting of the glomerular basement membrane.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Congenital neuromuscular disease with uniform type 1 fiber (CNMDU1) is a rare form of congenital myopathy, which is pathologically diagnosed by the presence of more than 99% of type 1 fiber, with no specific structural changes. Its pathogenic mechanism is still unknown. We recently reported that almost all patients with central core disease (CCD) with ryanodine receptor 1 gene (RYR1) mutations in the C-terminal domain had type 1 fibers, nearly exclusively, in addition to typical central cores. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether CNMDU1 is associated with RYR1 mutation. METHODS: We studied 10 unrelated Japanese patients who were diagnosed to have CNMDU1 based on clinical features and muscle pathology showing more than 99% type 1 muscle fibers. We extracted genomic DNA from frozen muscles and directly sequenced all 106 exons and their flanking intron-exon boundaries of RYR1. RESULTS: Four of 10 patients had a heterozygous mutation, three missense and one deletion, all in the C-terminal domain of RYR1. Two missense mutations were previously reported in CCD patients. Clinically, patients with mutations in RYR1 showed milder phenotype compared with those without mutations. CONCLUSION: Congenital neuromuscular disease with uniform type 1 fiber (CNMDU1) in 40% of patients is associated with mutations in the C-terminal domain of RYR1, suggesting that CNMDU1 is allelic to central core disease at least in some patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Collagen VI mutations cause mild Bethlem myopathy and severe, progressive Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD). We identified a novel homozygous COL6A1 premature termination mutation in a UCMD patient that causes nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Collagen VI microfibrils cannot be detected in muscle or fibroblasts. The parents are heterozygous carriers of the mutation and their fibroblasts produce reduced amounts of collagen VI. The molecular findings in the parents are analogous to those reported for a heterozygous COL6A1 premature termination mutation that causes Bethlem myopathy. However, the parents of our UCMD proband are clinically normal. The proband's brother, also a carrier, has clinical features consistent with a mild collagen VI phenotype. Following a request for prenatal diagnosis in a subsequent pregnancy we found the fetus was a heterozygous carrier indicating that it would not be affected with severe UCMD. COL6A1 premature termination mutations exhibit variable penetrance necessitating a cautious approach to genetic counselling.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We aimed to correlate pathologic findings with MTM1 mutation type in a series of molecularly defined XLMTM cases. Clinical data from 15 XLMTM patients and their corresponding 16 muscle biopsies were studied. All patients were infants (range: 6-217 days old) when initially biopsied. The proportion of myofibers with central nuclei did not correlate with clinical outcome, however, morphometric studies showed that survivors had larger myofiber diameters in infancy than those who died (10.4+/-3.9microm versus 8.9+/-3microm; p&lt;0.001). As a corollary, patients with MTM1 missense mutations had larger myofiber diameters (11.1+/-4microm), than those with truncation/deletion mutations (8.6+/-2.7microm) (controls 11.7+/-2.5microm) (p&lt;0.0001). These data indicate that differences in myofiber size correlate with MTM1 mutation type and patient outcome. Failure to attain and/or maintain myofiber size, along with fiber type perturbations and the misplacement of myofiber nuclei and other organelles, are important components of XLMTM muscle pathology.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Rippling muscle disease (RMD) is a rare form of myopathy that is characterized by percussion-induced rapid muscle contractions, muscle mounding, and rippling. Recently a caveolin-3 gene (CAV3) mutation was identified in patients suffering from autosomal dominant RMD. We encountered a Korean male patient with RMD who had suffered from muscle stiffness for 3 years. Mutation analysis of the CAV3 gene revealed the patient to be heterozygous for a novel in-frame deletion mutation (c.307_312delGTGGTG; Phe103_Phe104del). Further analysis of his family members showed that his mother and elder sister also have the same mutation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of genetically confirmed RMD in Korea.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The myogenic factor Myf5 defines the onset of myogenesis in mammals during development. Mice lacking both Myf5 and MyoD fail to form myoblasts and are characterized by a complete absence of skeletal muscle at birth. To investigate the function of Myf5 in adult skeletal muscle, we generated Myf5 and mdx compound mutants, which are characterized by constant regeneration. Double mutant mice show an increase of dystrophic changes in the musculature, although these mice were viable and the degree of myopathy was modest. Myf5 mutant muscles show a small decrease in the number of muscle satellite cells, which was within the range of physiological variations. We also observed a significant delay in the regeneration of Myf5 deficient skeletal muscles after injury. Interestingly, Myf5 deficient skeletal muscles were able to even out this flaw during the course of regeneration, generating intact muscles 4 weeks after injury. Although we did not detect a striking reduction of MyoD positive activated myoblasts or of Myf5-LacZ positive cells in regenerating muscles, a clear decrease in the proliferation rate of satellite cell-derived myoblasts was apparent in satellite cell-derived cultures. The reduction of the proliferation rate of Myf5 mutant myoblasts was also reflected by a delayed transition from proliferation to differentiation, resulting in a reduced number of myotube nuclei after 6 and 7 days of culture. We reason that Myf5 supports efficient skeletal muscle regeneration by enabling transient myoblast amplification. Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this article.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV) or hereditary inclusion body myopathy (hIBM) is an autosomal recessive disorder clinically characterized by weakness that initially involves the distal muscles, although other muscles can be affected as well. Pathological hallmarks include the presence of rimmed vacuoles (RVs) and intracellular Congo red-positive depositions in vacuolated or nonvacuolated fibers. Mutations in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in sialic acid biosynthesis, are causative of DMRV/hIBM. Recently, we have generated a mouse model (Gne(-/-)hGNEV572L-Tg) for this disease, and have shown that these mice exhibit hyposialylation and intracellular amyloid deposition before the characteristic RVs are detected, indicating that autophagy is a downstream phenomenon to hyposialylation and amyloid deposition in DMRV/hIBM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Frontotemporal dementia with inclusion body myopathy and Paget's disease of bone (IBMPFD) is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the gene valosin-containing protein (VCP). The CNS pathology is characterized by a novel pattern of ubiquitin pathology distinct from sporadic and familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions without VCP mutations. Yet, the ubiquitin-positive inclusions in IBMPFD also stain for TAR DNA binding protein, a feature that links this rare disease with the pathology associated with the majority of sporadic FTD as well as disease resulting from different genetic alterations. VCP, a member of the AAA-ATPase gene family, associates with a plethora of protein adaptors to perform a variety of cellular processes including Golgi assembly/disassembly and regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. However, the mechanism whereby mutations in VCP lead to CNS, muscle, and bone disease is largely unknown. In this report, we review current literature on IBMPFD, focusing on the pathology of the disease and the biology of VCP with respect to IBMPFD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>This study aimed at evaluating OS in an amyotrophic quadricipital syndrome with cardiac impairment in a family of 80 members with a mutation in lamin A/C gene. Twelve patients had cardiac involvement (5 cardiac and skeletal muscles impairment). OS was evaluated in blood samples (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), carbonylated proteins (PCO)) 6 "affected patients" with phenotypic and genotypic abnormalities without heart failure and 3 "healthy carrier" patients. OS was higher in affected patients than in healthy, as shown by the higher TBARS and PCO values. Patients with cardiac and peripheral myopathy exhibited a higher OS than patients with only cardiac disease (TBARS: 1.73 +/- 0.05 vs. 1.51 +/-0.04 mmol/l (p = 0.051), PCO: 2.73 +/- 0.34 vs. 0.90 +/-0.10 nmol/mg protein (p = 0.47)), and with healthy carriers patients (TBARS: 1.73 +/- 0.05 vs. 1.16 +/- 0.14 mmol/l (p = 0.05), PCO: 2.73 +/-0.34 vs. 0.90 +/-0.20 nmol/mg protein (p = 0.47)). OS may thus contribute to the degenerative process of this laminopathy. ROS production occurs, prior to heart failure symptoms. We suggest that the extent activation may also promote the variable phenotypic expression of the disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: The giant protein titin is essential for striated muscle development, structure, and elasticity. All titin mutations reported to date cause late-onset, dominant disorders involving either skeletal muscle or the heart. Our aim was to delineate the phenotype and determine the genetic defects in two consanguineous families with an early-onset, recessive muscle and cardiac disorder. METHODS: Clinical and myopathological reevaluation of the five affected children, positional cloning, immunofluorescence, and Western blot studies were performed. RESULTS: All children presented with congenital muscle weakness and childhood-onset fatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Skeletal muscle biopsies showed minicores, centrally located nuclei, and/or dystrophic lesions. In each family, we identified a homozygous titin deletion in exons encoding the C-terminal M-line region. Both deletions cause a frameshift downstream of the titin kinase domain and protein truncation. Immunofluorescence confirmed that truncated titins lacking the C-terminal end were incorporated into sarcomeres. Calpain 3 was secondarily depleted. INTERPRETATION: M-line titin homozygous truncations cause the first congenital and purely recessive titinopathy, and the first to involve both cardiac and skeletal muscle. These results expand the spectrum of early-onset myopathies and suggest that titin segments downstream of the kinase domain are dispensable for skeletal and cardiac muscle development, but are crucial for maintaining sarcomere integrity.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In 1965, an adult-onset, autosomal dominant disorder with a peculiar scapuloperoneal distribution of weakness and atrophy was described in a large, multi-generation kindred and named 'scapuloperoneal syndrome type Kaeser' (OMIM #181400). By genetic analysis of the original kindred, we discovered a heterozygous missense mutation of the desmin gene (R350P) cosegregating with the disorder. Moreover, we detected DES R350P in four unrelated German families allowing for genotype-phenotype correlations in a total of 15 patients carrying the same mutation. Large clinical variability was recognized, even within the same family, ranging from scapuloperoneal (n = 2, 12%), limb girdle (n = 10, 60%) and distal phenotypes (n = 3, 18%) with variable cardiac (n = 7, 41%) or respiratory involvement (n = 7, 41%). Facial weakness, dysphagia and gynaecomastia were frequent additional symptoms. Overall and within each family, affected men seemingly bear a higher risk of sudden, cardiac death as compared to affected women. Moreover, histological and immunohistochemical examination of muscle biopsy specimens revealed a wide spectrum of findings ranging from near normal or unspecific pathology to typical, myofibrillar changes with accumulation of desmin. This study reveals that the clinical and pathological variability generally observed in desminopathies may not be attributed to the nature of the DES mutation alone, but may be influenced by additional genetic and epigenetic factors such as gender. In addition, mutations of the desmin gene should be considered early in the diagnostic work-up of any adult-onset, dominant myopathy, even if specific myofibrillar pathology is absent.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The prion protein (PrP) level in muscle has been reported to be elevated in patients with inclusion-body myositis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and neurogenic muscle atrophy, but it is not clear whether the elevated PrP accumulation in the muscles is sufficient to cause muscle diseases. We have generated transgenic mice with muscle-specific expression of PrP under extremely tight regulation by doxycycline, and we have demonstrated that doxycycline-induced overexpression of PrP strictly limited to muscles leads to a myopathy characterized by increased variation of myofiber size, centrally located nuclei, and endomysial fibrosis, in the absence of intracytoplasmic inclusions, rimmed vacuoles, or any evidence of a neurogenic disorder. The PrP-induced myopathy correlates with accumulation of an N-terminal truncated PrP fragment in the muscle, and the muscular PrP displayed consistent mild resistance to protease digestion. Our findings indicate that overexpression of wild-type PrP in skeletal muscles is sufficient to cause a primary myopathy with no signs of peripheral neuropathy, possibly due to accumulation of a cytotoxic truncated form of PrP and/or PrP aggregation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Desminopathy represents a subgroup of myofibrillar myopathies caused by mutations in the desmin gene. Three novel disease-associated mutations in the desmin gene were identified in unrelated Spanish families affected by cardioskeletal myopathy. A selective pattern of muscle involvement, which differed from that observed in myofibrillar myopathy resulting from mutations in the myotilin gene, was observed in each of the three families with novel mutations and each of three desminopathy patients with known desmin mutations. Prominent joint retractions at the ankles and characteristic nasal speech were observed early in the course of illness. These findings suggest that muscle imaging in combination with routine clinical and pathological examination may be helpful in distinguishing desminopathy from other forms of myofibrillar myopathy and ordering appropriate molecular investigations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Synovial sarcoma is an aggressive soft-tissue malignancy marked by a unique t(X;18) translocation leading to expression of a chimeric SYT-SSX fusion protein. We report here a mouse model of synovial sarcoma based on conditional expression of the human SYT-SSX2. Using this model, we have identified myoblasts as a potential source of synovial sarcoma. Remarkably, within the skeletal muscle lineage, while expression of the oncoprotein in immature myoblasts leads to induction of synovial sarcoma with 100% penetrance, its expression in more differentiated cells induces myopathy without tumor induction. We also show that early widespread expression of the fusion protein disrupts normal embryogenesis, causing lethality.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Rare reports on patients with congenital myopathy with excess of muscle spindles (CMEMS), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and variable features resembling Noonan syndrome have been published, but the genetic basis of this condition is so far unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed PTPN11 and RAS genes in five unrelated patients with this phenotype, and found HRAS mutations in four of them. Two disease-associated mutations, G12V and G12S, have previously been observed in patients with Costello syndrome (CS), and two other mutations, E63K and Q22K, are novel. All four mutations are predicted to enhance downstream HRas signalling, suggesting that CMEMS is a developmental consequence of sustained HRas activation in skeletal muscle. CONCLUSION: This type of myopathy may represent a previously unrecognized manifestation of CS. However, some patients carrying HRAS mutations may exhibit prominent congenital muscular dysfunction, although features of CS may be less obvious, suggesting that germline HRAS mutations may underlie some cases of otherwise unclassified neonatal neuromuscular disorders.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) is a pathologically defined group of hereditary human muscle diseases, characterized by focal myofibrillar destruction and cytoplasmic aggregates that contain several Z-disc-related proteins. The previously reported MFM-associated mutation (8130G --> A; W2710X) in the filamin C gene (FLNC) leads to a partial disturbance of the secondary structure of the dimerization domain of filamin C, resulting in massive protein aggregation in skeletal muscle fibers of the patients. Here, we provide a thorough characterization of the biochemical, biophysical and cellular properties of the mutated filamin C polypeptide. Our experiments revealed that the mutant dimerization domain is less stable and more susceptible to proteolysis. As a consequence, it does not dimerize properly and forms aggregates in vitro. Furthermore, the expression of mutant filamin in cultured cells results in the formation of protein aggregates. The mutant filamin does not associate with wild type filamin. These findings are of great importance to explain the pathomechanism of this disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder with heterogenous phenotypic manifestations and genetic background. We describe seven patients from five independent families with an isolated myopathic phenotype of CoQ10 deficiency. The clinical, histological and biochemical presentation of our patients was very homogenous. All patients presented with exercise intolerance, fatigue, proximal myopathy and high serum CK. Muscle histology showed lipid accumulation and subtle signs of mitochondrial myopathy. Biochemical measurement of muscle homogenates showed severely decreased activities of respiratory chain complexes I and II + III, while complex IV (COX) was moderately decreased. CoQ10 was significantly decreased in the skeletal muscle of all patients. Tandem mass spectrometry detected multiple acyl-CoA deficiency, leading to the analysis of the electron-transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETFDH) gene, previously shown to result in another metabolic disorder, glutaric aciduria type II (GAII). All of our patients carried autosomal recessive mutations in ETFDH, suggesting that ETFDH deficiency leads to a secondary CoQ10 deficiency. Our results indicate that the late-onset form of GAII and the myopathic form of CoQ10 deficiency are allelic diseases. Since this condition is treatable, correct diagnosis is of the utmost importance and should be considered both in children and in adults. We suggest to give patients both CoQ10 and riboflavin supplementation, especially for long-term treatment.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) genes confer susceptibility for the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs). METHODS: A large cross-sectional study of UK caucasian adults with polymyositis (PM, n = 101), dermatomyositis (DM, n = 94) and myositis overlapping with a connective tissue disease (myositis/CTD-overlap, n = 70) was completed. 177 ethnically matched controls were available for comparison. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within intronic regions coding for IL-4, IFN-gamma and a microsatellite marker within intron 1 of the IFN-gamma gene were typed. RESULTS: Strong linkage disequilibrium was present between SNPs in each gene. In the IFN-gamma gene, a weak allelic association was observed in PM versus controls at rs1861493 (odds ratio (OR) 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 2.4). The microsatellite IFN-gamma CA(14) allele was associated with risk for IIMs overall (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.4 to 7.8), the strongest association being observed within the anti-U1-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) group (OR 6.0, 95% CI 1.5 to 23.1), and persisting after adjustment for known myositis human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class II associations. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic markers in the IFN-gamma gene demonstrate significant allelic associations with the IIMs in a UK Caucasian population. The SNPs tested in this study within the region coding for IL-4 fail to show significant associations with susceptibility to IIM disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Rippling muscle disease (RMD) is a benign myopathy with symptoms and signs of muscular hyperirritability. We report a 17-year-old patient who presented with muscular hypertrophy, local mounding on percussion, and a rippling phenomenon. Needle electromyography showed electrical silence during the rippling phenomenon. Muscle protein immunohistochemical analysis showed a partial deficiency of caveolin-3. Molecular analysis revealed a novel heterozygous A>C transition at nucleotide position 140 in exon 2 of the caveolin-3 gene. We associated this novel mutation with RMD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: McArdle disease, a common metabolic myopathy with autosomal recessive inheritance, is caused by a frequent R50X mutation and many rare mutations in the myophosphorylase gene. OBJECTIVES: To identify spectrum and frequencies of myophosphorylase gene mutations in a large cohort of patients with McArdle disease, to discuss diagnostic implications, and to analyse genotype-phenotype relationship. METHODS: Molecular genetic analysis of 56 index patients with muscle biopsy-proven myophosphorylase deficiency from Germany (n = 35), UK (n = 13), and several other countries (n = 8) was performed using direct sequencing. RESULTS: Allele frequency of the R50X mutation was 58%, and 71% of the patients carried this mutation at least on one allele. We detected 26 other less common mutations, 13 of which are novel: G157V, R161C, Q337R, E384K, S450L, G486D, R570W, K575E, IVS6-2A>T, IVS10+1G>A, R650X, c.1354insC, c.1155_1156delGG. There was no genotype-phenotype correlation with respect to age of onset and severity. R270X was the most frequent mutation among the less common mutations reaching an allele frequency of 5% followed by R94W and G686R representing a frequency of 4% each. CONCLUSIONS: The study further extends the genetic heterogeneity of myophosphorylase gene mutations showing no mutational hotspot and no genotype-phenotype correlation. Most novel missense mutations were located in secondary structures or active sites of the enzyme. Some of the less common mutations are recurrent with different frequencies within Europe. Ethnic origin and frequency of less common mutations must be considered to establish efficient strategies in molecular genetic testing. Performing molecular testing can avoid muscle biopsy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>REASONS FOR PERFORMING STUDY: Transport of lactate across membranes is facilitated by proton-monocarboxylate transporters (MCT). The most widely distributed isoform is MCT1, which needs an ancillary protein CD147. Studies on erythrocytes have shown that high activity of MCT1 is inherited as the dominant allele and that activity is regulated through CD147. Mutations of human MCT1 have been described that appear to impair lactate transport in muscles and cause exertional rhabdomyolysis. There are no reports of this potential relationship in the horse. OBJECTIVES: To obtain sequences of equine MCT1 and CD147 to examine differences between horses with high and low lactate transport activity in their erythrocytes. METHODS: Muscle biopsy samples were taken from 3 healthy Standardbred horses and from 7 horses which according to the owners had signs of myopathy after intense exercise. DNA and RNA were isolated and PCR analysis and sequencing performed. RESULTS: Currently, PCR fragments covering 100% of MCT1 and 70% of CD147 coding region are retained and sequence analysis has demonstrated one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the C-terminal area of MCT1 and one SNP in the extracellular domain of CD147. Both cause an amino acid change. The SNPs found are not related to lactate transport activity in erythrocytes or signs of myopathy. CONCLUSIONS: More samples need to be analysed to make conclusions on the significance of the polymorphisms found. Furthermore, full sequence coverage of the coding region of CD147 is needed. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: The molecular probes produced could be used as tools to study gene regulation of lactate transport.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Barth syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by the tafazzin (TAZ) gene mutations and includes dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) with left ventricular non-compaction, neutropenia, skeletal myopathy, abnormal mitochondria and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. Dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular non-compaction transmitted as an autosomal dominant condition has also been associated with LIM domain-binding 3 (LDB3) gene defects. We describe a family in which the 12-year-old proband had left ventricular non-compaction and DCM. His mother had five miscarriages, two other sons who died in infancy, and a healthy son and daughter. The proband showed left ventricular non-compaction-DCM, skeletal myopathy, recurrent oral aphthous ulcers and cyclic neutropenia. The DCM progressively improved with age; medical therapy was discontinued at 5 years of age. At present, left ventricular function is normal and arrhythmias are absent. Magnetic resonance imaging documented left ventricular non-compaction. However, oral aphthous ulcers and cyclic neutropenia have recurred. In the proband we identified two novel mutations, one of maternal origin in the TAZ gene (p.[Glu202ValfsX15]) and one of paternal origin in the LDB3 gene (p.[Thr350Ile]). The mother, brother and father are healthy; although the latter two show prominent left ventricle trabeculation without dysfunction. Expression studies of TAZ and LDB3 genes were conducted in family members and controls. In the proband, brother and father, LDB3 expression was similar to control cases. TAZ and LDB3 expression progressively declined with age in control both blood and myocardial samples. However, an endomyocardial biopsy performed in the proband at 6 months of age, showed significantly lower TAZ and LDB3 expression than in age-matched myocardial controls. We believe that the clinical, genetic and expression data support the hypothesis that tafazzins are essential during fetal and early post-natal life.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The R120G mutation in the small heat shock-like protein alphaB-crystallin (CryAB(R120G)) causes desmin-related myopathy (DRM), which is characterized by the formation of desmin- and CryAB-containing aggregates within muscle fibers. Mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of CryAB(R120G) develop cardiomyopathy at 3 months and die at 6-7 months from heart failure (HF). Previous studies showed that overexpression of CryAB(R120G) results in accumulation of preamyloid oligomer (PAO). PAO is considered to be the cytotoxic entity in many of the protein misfolding-based neurodegenerative diseases. On the basis of data from mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases showing that exercise or environmental enrichment reduces the amyloid oligomer level and improves cognitive ability, we hypothesized that CryAB(R120G)-induced DRM would also respond favorably to prolonged voluntary exercise, reducing HF symptoms and rescuing the mice from premature death. Six months of voluntary exercise in CryAB(R120G) animals resulted in 100% survival at a time when all unexercised mice had died. After 22 weeks of exercise, PAO levels were decreased by 47% compared with the unexercised CryAB(R120G) control mice (P = 0.00001). Although CryAB(R120G) expression led to decreased levels of the metallomembrane endopeptidase neprilysin, normal levels were maintained in the exercised CryAB(R120G) mice, and in vitro loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments using adenovirus-infected cardiomyocytes confirmed the importance of neprilysin in ameliorating PAO accumulation. The data demonstrate that voluntary exercise slows the progression to HF in the CryAB(R120G) DRM model and that PAO accumulation is mediated, at least in part, by decreased neprilysin activity.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Mutations in ACTA1 have been associated with a variety of changes in muscle histology that likely result from fundamental differences in the way that ACTA1 mutations disrupt muscle function. Recently, we reported three patients with congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD) caused by novel heterozygous missense mutations in ACTA1 (D292V, L221P, P332S) with marked type 1 fiber hypotrophy as the only pathological finding on muscle biopsy. We have investigated the basis for the histological differences between these CFTD patients and patients with ACTA1 nemaline myopathy (NM). METHODS AND RESULTS: Mass spectrometry and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis demonstrate that mutant actin accounts for 25 and 50% of alpha-skeletal actin in the skeletal muscle of patients with the P332S and D292V mutations, respectively, consistent with a dominant-negative disease mechanism. In vitro motility studies indicate that abnormal interactions between actin and tropomyosin are the likely principal cause of muscle weakness for D292V, with tropomyosin stabilized in the "switched off" position. Both the D292V and P322S CFTD mutations are associated with normal sarcomeric structure on electron microscopy, which is atypical for severe NM. In contrast, we found no clear difference between ACTA1 mutations associated with NM and CFTD in tendency to polymerize or aggregate in C2C12 expression models. INTERPRETATION: These data suggest that ACTA1 CFTD mutations cause weakness by disrupting sarcomere function rather than structure. We raise the possibility that the presence or absence of structural disorganization when mutant actin incorporates into sarcomeres may be an important determinant of whether the histological patterns of CFTD or NM develop in ACTA1 myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The slow alpha-tropomyosin (TPM3) gene has to date been associated with few cases of both dominant and recessive nemaline myopathies. We report the identification of a p.Arg167His mutation in a four-generation family presenting with a mild classical form of the disease. Clinically, there was no correlation between the age at presentation and the severity of the disease. The dominant-negative p.Arg167His mutation is a recurrent mutation, previously reported in one sporadic case. Histological studies showed discrepancy between the two reports. While a type II fibre predominance was described in the sporadic case, we observed an almost complete type I fibre predominance. This study emphasizes the variability in histopathological phenotypes seen with TPM3 mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Centronuclear myopathy is a genetically heterogeneous congenital myopathy. Whilst mutations in the myotubularin (MTM1) gene are implicated in the X-linked variant, mutations in the dynamin 2 (DNM2) gene have been recently associated with dominant inheritance. We report a 16-year-old girl with clinical features of a congenital myopathy and external ophthalmoplegia. Multiple central nuclei affecting up to 50% of fibres and central accumulation of oxidative enzyme stains were the most prominent findings on muscle biopsy obtained at 1 year. However, some core-like areas appeared on repeat biopsy 8 years later; in addition, muscle MRI was compatible with the pattern we previously reported in patients with mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene. Mutational analysis identified a de novo dominant RYR1 missense mutation (c.12335C>T; Ser4112Leu) affecting a highly conserved domain of the protein. Our findings expand the phenotypical spectrum associated with RYR1 mutations and indicate that RYR1 screening should be considered in centronuclear myopathy patients without MTM1 or DNM2 mutations; muscle MRI may aid selection of appropriate genetic testing.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Statin-related skeletal muscle disorders range from benign myalgias--such as non-specific muscle aches or joint pains without elevated serum creatinine kinase (CK) concentration--to true myositis with >10-fold elevation of serum CK, to rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria. The genetic basis of statin-related muscle disorders is largely unknown. Because mutations in the COQ2 gene are associated with severe inherited myopathy, we hypothesized that common, mild genetic variation in COQ2 would be associated with inter-individual variation in statin intolerance. We studied 133 subjects who developed myopathy on statin monotherapy and 158 matched controls who tolerated statins without incident or complaint. RESULTS: COQ2 genotypes, based on two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP1 and SNP2) and a 2-SNP haplotype, all showed significant associations with statin intolerance. Specifically, the odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) for increased risk of statin intolerance among homozygotes for the rare alleles were 2.42 (0.99 to 5.89), 2.33 (1.13 to 4.81) and 2.58 (1.26 to 5.28) for SNP1 and SNP2 genotypes, and the 2-SNP haplotype, respectively. CONCLUSION: These preliminary pharmacogenetic results, if confirmed, are consistent with the idea that statin intolerance which is manifested primarily through muscle symptoms is associated with genomic variation in COQ2 and thus perhaps with the CoQ10 pathway.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Protein degradation in eukaryotes often requires the ubiquitin-selective chaperone p97 for substrate recruitment and ubiquitin-chain assembly. However, the physiological relevance of p97, and its role in developmental processes, remain unclear. Here, we discover an unanticipated function for CDC-48/p97 in myosin assembly and myofibril organization, both in Caenorhabditis elegans and humans. The developmentally regulated assembly of a CDC-48-UFD-2-CHN-1 complex links turnover of the myosin-directed chaperone UNC-45 to functional muscle formation. Our data suggest a similarly conserved pathway regulating myosin assembly in humans. Remarkably, mutations in human p97, known to cause hereditary inclusion-body myopathy, abrogate UNC-45 degradation and result in severely disorganized myofibrils, detrimental towards sarcomeric function. These results identify a key role for CDC-48/p97 in the process of myofibre differentiation and maintenance, which is abolished during pathological conditions leading to protein aggregation and inclusion-body formation in human skeletal muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The dysferlin gene is mutated in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B, Miyoshi myopathy, and distal anterior compartment myopathy. In mature skeletal muscle, dysferlin is located predominantly at the sarcolemma, where it plays a role in membrane fusion and repair. To investigate the role of dysferlin during early muscle differentiation, its localization was studied at high resolution in a muscle cell line. This demonstrated that dysferlin is not expressed at the plasmalemma of myotubes but mostly localizes to the T-tubule network. However, dysferlin translocated to the site of injury and toward the plasma membrane in a Ca2+-dependent fashion in response to a newly designed in vitro wounding assay. This reaction was specific to the full-length protein, as heterologously expressed deletion mutants of distinct C2 domains of dysferlin did not show this response. These results shed light on the dynamics of muscle membrane repair and are highly indicative of a specific role of dysferlin in this process in early myogenesis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We identified a novel G3283A transition in the mitochondrial DNA tRNA(Leu (UUR)) gene in a patient with ptosis, ophthalmoparesis and hyporeflexia. Muscle biopsy showed cytochrome oxidase positive ragged-red fibers, and defects of complexes I, III and IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The mutation was heteroplasmic in muscle of the proband, being absent in her blood. Ragged-red fibers harbored greater levels of mutant genomes than normal fibers. The G3283A mutation affects a strictly conserved base pair in the TPsiC stem of the gene and was not found in controls, thus satisfying the accepted criteria for pathogenicity.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In order to characterize, at the clinical, molecular and imaging level, myopathies due to MYH7 gene mutations, MYH7 gene analysis was conducted by RT-PCR/SSCP/sequencing in two patients diagnosed with myosin storage myopathy and 17 patients diagnosed with scapulo-peroneal myopathy of unknown etiology. MYH7 gene studies revealed the 5533C>T mutation (Arg1845Trp) in both myosin storage myopathy and in 2 of the 17 scapulo-peroneal patients studied. 5533C>T segregation analysis in the mutation carrier families identified 11 additional patients. The clinical spectrum in our cohort of patients included asymptomatic hyperCKemia, scapulo-peroneal myopathy and proximal and distal myopathy with muscle hypertrophy. Muscle MRI identified a unique pattern in the posterior compartment of the thigh, characterized by early involvement of the biceps femoris and semimembranosus, with relative sparing of the semitendinosus. Muscle biopsy revealed hyaline bodies in only half of biopsied patients (2/4). In conclusion, phenotypic and histopathological variability may underlie MYH7 gene mutation and the absence of hyaline bodies in muscle biopsies does not rule out MYH7 gene mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlin is a type-II transmembrane protein and the causative gene of limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and Miyoshi myopathy (LGMD2B/MM), in which specific loss of dysferlin labeling has been frequently observed. Recently, a novel mutant (L1341P) dysferlin has been shown to aggregate in the muscle of the patient. Little is known about the relationship between degradation of dysferlin and pathogenesis of LGMD2B/MM. Here, we examined the degradation of normal and mutant (L1341P) dysferlin. Wild-type (wt) dysferlin mainly localized to the ER/Golgi, associated with retrotranslocon, Sec61alpha, and VCP(p97), and was degraded by endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation system (ERAD) composed of ubiquitin/proteasome. In contrast, mutant dysferlin spontaneously aggregated in the ER and induced eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) phosphorylation and LC3 conversion, a key step for autophagosome formation, and finally, ER stress cell death. Unlike proteasome inhibitor, E64d/pepstatin A, inhibitors of lysosomal proteases did not stimulate the accumulation of the wt-dysferlin, but stimulated aggregation of mutant dysferlin in the ER. Furthermore, deficiency of Atg5 and dephosphorylation of eIF2alpha, key molecules for LC3 conversion, also stimulated the mutant dysferlin aggregation in the ER. Rapamycin, which induces eIF2alpha phosphorylation-mediated LC3 conversion, inhibited mutant dysferlin aggregation in the ER. Thus, mutant dysferlin aggregates in the ER-stimulated autophagosome formation to engulf them via activation of ER stress-eIF2alpha phosphorylation pathway. We propose two ERAD models for dysferlin degradation, ubiquitin/proteasome ERAD(I) and autophagy/lysosome ERAD(II). Mutant dysferlin aggregates on the ER are degraded by the autophagy/lysosome ERAD(II), as an alternative to ERAD(I), when retrotranslocon/ERAD(I) system is impaired by these mutant aggregates.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in p97/VCP cause the autosomal-dominant, inherited syndrome inclusion body myopathy (IBM) associated with Paget's disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) (Watts, G.D., Wymer, J., Kovach, M.J., Mehta, S.G., Mumm, S., Darvish, D., Pestronk, A., Whyte, M.P. and Kimonis, V.E. (2004) Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia is caused by mutant valosin-containing protein. p97/VCP is a multi-functional protein with a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (Wang, Q., Song, C. and Li, C.C. (2004) Molecular perspectives on p97-VCP: progress in understanding its structure and diverse biological functions. To understand how mutations in this protein lead to a myopathy, we generated several lines of transgenic mice expressing p97/VCP-WT (TgVCP-WT) or the most common IBMPFD mutant, p97/VCP R155H (TgVCP-RH), under a muscle-specific promoter. TgVCP-RH animals, but not controls, became progressively weaker in a dose-dependent manner starting at 6 months of age. Abnormal muscle pathology, which included coarse internal architecture, vacuolation and disorganized membrane morphology with reduced caveolin-3 expression at the sarcolemma developed coincident with the onset of weakness. These changes were not associated with alterations in sarcolemmal integrity as measured by muscle fiber uptake of Evan's blue dye. Even before animals displayed measurable weakness, there was an increase in ubiquitin-containing protein inclusions and high-molecular-weight ubiquitinated proteins, markers of UPS dysfunction. We suggest that this early and persistent increase in ubiquitinated proteins induced by IBMPFD mutations in p97/VCP may ultimately lead to animal weakness and the observed muscle pathology. TgVCP-RH animals will be a valuable tool for understanding the pathogenesis of IBM and the role of the UPS in skeletal muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Desmin-related myofibrillar myopathy (DRM) is a cardiac and skeletal muscle disease caused by mutations in the desmin (DES) gene. Mutations in the central 2B domain of DES cause skeletal muscle disease that typically precedes cardiac involvement. However, the prevalence of DES mutations in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) without skeletal muscle disease is not known. METHODS AND RESULTS: Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography was used to screen DES for mutations in 116 DCM families from the Familial Dilated Cardiomyopathy Registry and in 309 subjects with DCM from the Beta-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial (BEST). DES mutations were transfected into SW13 and human smooth muscle cells and neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, and the effects on cytoskeletal desmin network architecture were analyzed with confocal microscopy. Five novel missense DES mutations, including the first localized to the highly conserved 1A domain, were detected in 6 subjects (1.4%). Transfection of DES mutations in the 2B domain severely disrupted the fine intracytoplasmic staining of desmin, causing clumping of the desmin protein. A tail domain mutation (Val459Ile) showed milder effects on desmin cytoplasmic network formation and appears to be a low-penetrant mutation restricted to black subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of DES mutations in DCM is between 1% and 2%, and mutations in the 1A helical domain, as well as the 2B rod domain, are capable of causing a DCM phenotype. The lack of severe disruption of cytoskeletal desmin network formation seen with mutations in the 1A and tail domains suggests that dysfunction of seemingly intact desmin networks is sufficient to cause DCM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A novel single-nucleotide deletion in exon 100 of the RYR1 gene, corresponding to deletion of nucleotide 14,510 in the human RyR1 mRNA (c14510delA), was identified in a man with malignant hyperthermia and in his two daughters who were normal for malignant hyperthermia. This deletion results in a RyR1 protein lacking the last 202 amino acid residues. All three subjects heterozygotic for the mutated allele presented with a prevalence of type 1 fibres with central cores, although none experienced clinical signs of myopathy. Expression of the truncated protein resulted in non-functional RYR1 calcium release channels. Expression of wild-type and RyR1(R4836fsX4838) proteins resulted in heterozygotic release channels with overall functional properties similar to those of wild-type RyR1 channels. Nevertheless, small differences in sensitivity to calcium and caffeine were observed in heterotetrameric channels, which also presented an altered assembly/stability in sucrose-gradient centrifugation analysis. Altogether, these data suggest that altered RYR1 tetramer assembly/stability coupled with subtle chronic changes in Ca2+ homoeostasis over the long term may contribute to the development of core lesions and incomplete malignant hyperthermia susceptibility penetrance in individuals carrying this novel RYR1 mutation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Statin therapy, although generally well tolerated, leads not infrequently to significant subjective and at times objective adverse effects (AEs), mainly of a muscular nature. The genetic background of these AEs is not clear and possibly side effects and lipid lowering efficacy may be linked. Aim of the study was a detailed evaluation of CYP450 and apolipoprotein E gene polymorphisms in two large series of age-sex matched patients with and without muscular side effects to statins. In a Clinical Institution specialised in lipid-lipoprotein disorders, 50 statin treated patients were selected, with subjective or objective statin-associated myopathy, evaluated using standardized forms. These were sex and age matched with 50 statin-treated patients from the same Clinic, without any subjective or objective complaints. DNA samples for the evaluation of CYP450 genetic polymorphisms and apo E genotypes were collected in order to assess correlations with both genetic polymorphisms and AEs, as well as with therapeutic efficacy. None of the assessed CYP450 polymorphisms appeared to be related to an increased incidence of AEs. The CYP2D6 *1/*4 and *4/4* poor metabolizer (PM) status was associated to a higher efficacy of statins metabolized by this system and, in addition, the apo E2 genotype was, in this series, linked to increased HDL-C levels after therapy. Patients with statin associated myopathy are not characterized by significantly different genotypes for the CYP450s responsible for statin metabolism. On the other hand, CYP2D6 PM status is associated to an increased efficacy of statins metabolized by this system.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To describe two symptomatic dysferlin gene mutation carriers. METHODS: One patient had limb girdle weakness. His brother was diagnosed with limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B with two mutations in the dysferlin gene (D625Y and E1734G). The second patient had distal weakness. He had two sons with Miyoshi myopathy with a homozygous mutation (G519R). We performed immunofluorescence (dystrophin, DAG proteins, dysferlin, caveolin-3), Western blot (dysferlin, caveolin-3, calpain-3), and real-time PCR (dysferlin) using skeletal muscle samples. We also studied dysferlin in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) by Western blot. RESULTS: In addition to the muscle weakness, both patients showed elevated creatine kinase and abnormal muscle MRI. They presented a mutation in only one allele after screening of the whole gene (skeletal muscle and monocyte mRNA and genomic DNA). A muscle biopsy specimen showed moderate dystrophic changes and patchy dysferlin expression in the sarcolemma. Western blot of both PBMs and skeletal muscle demonstrated a significant reduction in dysferlin. All the other proteins including caveolin-3 and calpain-3 were normal. Real-time PCR showed normal levels of dysferlin mRNA vs the patients' affected relatives. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of symptomatic carriers of dysferlin mutations should be considered when a pathologic pattern of dysferlin protein is observed.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Cardiac ankyrin-repeated protein (CARP) was originally identified as a protein specifically expressed in cardiomyocytes, but has recently been found to be upregulated in some muscle diseases including muscular dystrophy and myopathy, suggesting that CARP may be induced in some pathologic conditions. In this study, we immunohistochemically analyzed 69 renal biopsy samples from patients with glomerular diseases and 2 individuals with normal kidney. We found that CARP was expressed in renal podocytes at a high level in 10 of 13 cases of crescentic glomerulonephritis, 7 of 19 cases of diabetic nephropathy, and 12 of 20 cases of lupus nephritis, although it was not expressed in endocapillary glomerulonephritis, minimal change disease, thin basement membrane disease, membranous glomerulonephritis, and normal kidney. Interestingly, in lupus nephritis, CARP expression tended to be induced in cases exhibiting nephrotic syndrome, but less so in cases without nephrotic syndrome, suggesting that CARP expression is correlated with the severity of proteinuria. Furthermore, we found that CARP was not expressed in membranous glomerulonephritis but evidently expressed in most cases of membranous lupus nephritis. Although membranous glomerulonephritis and membranous lupus nephritis are sometimes morphologically indistinguishable, it is suggested that their pathologic mechanisms differ. Therefore, we propose that examination of CARP expression is useful for precise differential diagnosis of membranous glomerulonephritis and membranous lupus nephritis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Skeletal muscle has the ability to achieve rapid repair in response to injury or disease. Many individuals with Marfan syndrome (MFS), caused by a deficiency of extracellular fibrillin-1, exhibit myopathy and often are unable to increase muscle mass despite physical exercise. Evidence suggests that selected manifestations of MFS reflect excessive signaling by transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta (refs. 2,3). TGF-beta is a known inhibitor of terminal differentiation of cultured myoblasts; however, the functional contribution of TGF-beta signaling to disease pathogenesis in various inherited myopathic states in vivo remains unknown. Here we show that increased TGF-beta activity leads to failed muscle regeneration in fibrillin-1-deficient mice. Systemic antagonism of TGF-beta through administration of TGF-beta-neutralizing antibody or the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan normalizes muscle architecture, repair and function in vivo. Moreover, we show TGF-beta-induced failure of muscle regeneration and a similar therapeutic response in a dystrophin-deficient mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: About 20 % of nemaline myopathies are thus far related to skeletal muscle alpha-actin. Seven actin mutants located in different parts of the actin molecule and linked to different forms of the disease were selected and expressed as EGFP-tagged constructs in differentiated C2C12 mytoubes. Results were compared with phenotypes in patient skeletal muscle fibres and with previous expression studies in fibroblasts and C2C12 myoblasts/myotubes. RESULTS: Whereas EGFP wt-actin nicely incorporated into endogenous stress fibres and sarcomeric structures, the mutants showed a range of phenotypes, which generally changed upon differentiation. Many mutants appeared delocalized in myoblasts but integrated into endogenous actin structures after 4-6 days of differentiation, demonstrating a poor correlation between the appearance in myotubes and the severity of the disease. However, for some mutants, integration into stress fibres induced aberrant structures in differentiated cells, like thickening or fragmentation of stress fibres. Other mutants almost failed to integrate but formed huge aggregates in the cytoplasm of myotubes. Those did not co-stain with alpha-actinin, a main component of nemaline bodies found in patient muscle. Interestingly, nuclear aggregates as formed by two of the mutants in myoblasts were found less frequently or not at all in differentiated cells. CONCLUSION: Myotubes are a suitable system to study the capacity of a mutant to incorporate into actin structures or to form or induce pathological changes. Some of the phenotypes observed in undifferentiated myoblasts may only be in vitro effects. Other phenotypes, like aberrant stress fibres or rod formation may be more directly correlated with disease phenotypes. Some mutants did not induce any changes in the cellular actin system, indicating the importance of additional studies like functional assays to fully characterize the pathological impact of a mutant.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Central core disease (CCD) is an autosomal-dominant congenital myopathy, with muscle weakness and malignant hyperthermia (MH) susceptibility. We identified two of nine Brazilian CCD families carrying two mutations in the RYR1 gene. The heterozygous parents were clinically asymptomatic, and patients were mildly affected, differing from the few autosomal-recessive cases described previously. Recessive inheritance in CCD may therefore be more common than previously appreciated, which has important implications for genetic counseling and MH prevention in affected families.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) encompasses a genetically heterogeneous group of human diseases caused by mutations in genes coding for structural proteins of muscle. Mutations in the intermediate filament (IF) protein desmin (DES), a major cytoskeletal component of myocytes, lead to severe forms of "desminopathy," which affects cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle. Most mutations described reside in the central alpha-helical rod domain of desmin. Here we report three novel mutations--c.1325C>T (p.T442I), c.1360C>T (p.R454W), and c.1379G>T (p.S460I)--located in desmin's non-alpha-helical carboxy-terminal "tail" domain. We have investigated the impact of these and four--c.1237G>A (p.E413K), c.1346A>C (p.K449T), c.1353C>G (p.I451M), and c.1405G>A (p.V469M)--previously described "tail" mutations on in vitro filament formation and on the generation of ordered cytoskeletal arrays in transfected myoblasts. Although all but two mutants (p.E413K, p.R454W) assembled into IFs in vitro and all except p.E413K were incorporated into IF arrays in transfected C2C12 cells, filament properties differed significantly from wild-type desmin as revealed by viscometric assembly assays. Most notably, when coassembled with wild-type desmin, these mutants revealed a severe disturbance of filament-formation competence and filament-filament interactions, indicating an inherent incompatibility of mutant and wild-type protein to form mixed filaments. The various clinical phenotypes observed may reflect altered interactions of desmin's tail domain with different components of the myoblast cytoskeleton leading to diminished biomechanical properties and/or altered metabolism of the individual myocyte. Our in vitro assembly regimen proved to be a very sensible tool to detect if a particular desmin mutation is able to cause filament abnormalities.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We investigated the use of pharmacological chaperones for the therapy of Pompe disease, a metabolic myopathy due to mutations of the gene encoding the lysosomal hydrolase alpha-glucosidase (GAA) and characterized by generalized glycogen storage in cardiac and skeletal muscle. We studied the effects of two imino sugars, deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ), on residual GAA activity in fibroblasts from eight patients with different forms of Pompe disease (two classic infantile, two non-classic infantile onset, four late-onset forms), and with different mutations of the GAA gene. We demonstrated a significant increase of GAA activity (1.3-7.5-fold) after imino sugar treatment in fibroblasts from patients carrying the mutations L552P (three patients) and G549R (one patient). GAA enhancement was confirmed in HEK293T cells where the same mutations were overexpressed. No increase of GAA activity was observed for the other mutations. Western blot analysis showed that imino sugars increase the amount of mature GAA molecular forms. Immunofluorescence studies in HEK293T cells overexpressing the L552P mutation showed an improved trafficking of the mutant enzyme to lysosomes after imino sugar treatment. These results provide a rationale for an alternative treatment, other than enzyme replacement, to Pompe disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Central core disease (CCD) and multi-minicore disease (MmD) are muscle disorders characterized by foci of mitochondria depletion and sarcomere disorganization ("cores") in muscle fibers. Although core myopathies are the most frequent congenital myopathies, their pathogenesis remains elusive and specific diagnostic markers are lacking. Core myopathies are mostly caused by mutations in 2 sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins: the massive Ca-release channel RyR1 or the selenoprotein N (SelN) of unknown function. To search for distinctive markers and to obtain further pathophysiological insight, we identified the molecular defects in 12 core myopathy patients and analyzed the immunolocalization of 6 proteins of the Ca-release complex in their muscle biopsies. In 7 cases with RYR1 mutations (6 CCD, one MmD), RyR1 was depleted from the cores; in contrast, the other proteins of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (calsequestrin, SERCA1/2, and triadin) and the T-tubule (dihydropyridine receptor-alpha1subunit) accumulated within or around the lesions, suggesting an original modification of the Ca-release complex protein arrangement. Conversely, all Ca-related proteins were distributed normally in 5 MmD cases with SelN mutations. Our results provide an appropriate tool to orientate the differential and molecular diagnosis of core myopathies and suggest that different pathophysiological mechanisms lead to core formation in SelN- and in RyR1-related core myopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Although statins are prescribed as relatively safe and effective drugs for hypercholesterolemic patients, it has been reported that a significant side effect, myopathy, occurs infrequently during medication. Moreover, because statins decrease cardiac ubiquinone levels, the risk of cardiac dysfunction has been suggested. This study sought to evaluate and compare the cytotoxicity of statins (cerivastatin, pitavastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and pravastatin) in cultured human skeletal muscle cells (HSkMCs) and the effects on ubiquinone levels in statin-treated rat skeletal muscle and heart. Cerivastatin, the most potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, showed the strongest cytotoxicity (over 10-fold) among the statins examined, while the effects of the others were in a similar range. In rat experiments, neither pitavastatin nor cerivastatin decreased ubiquinone levels in skeletal muscle, but both dose-dependently lowered ubiquinone levels in the heart. As the rates of reduction by pitavastatin (9.6% at 30 mg/kg) and cerivastatin (9.7% at 0.3 mg/kg) were almost equal, it was estimated that cerivastatin reduced ubiquinone levels in the rat heart approximately 100-fold more strongly than pitavastatin, based on the effective doses. We found that cerivastatin showed the most potent cytotoxicity in HSkMCs and strongly lowered ubiquinone levels in the rat heart.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Most mutations of desmin that cause severe autosomal dominant forms of myofibrillar myopathy are point mutations and locate in the central alpha-helical coiled-coil rod domain. Recently, two in-frame deletions of one and three amino acids, respectively, in the alpha-helix have been described and discussed to drastically interfere with the architecture of the desmin dimer and possibly also the formation of tetramers and higher order complexes [Kaminska, A., Strelkov, S.V., Goudeau, B., Olive, M., Dagvadorj, A., Fidzianska, A., Simon-Casteras, M., Shatunov, A., Dalakas, M.C., Ferrer, I., Kwiecinski, H., Vicart, P., Goldfarb, L.G., 2004. Small deletions disturb desmin architecture leading to breakdown of muscle cells and development of skeletal or cardioskeletal myopathy. Hum. Genet. 114, 306-313.]. Therefore, it was proposed that they may poison intermediate filament (IF) assembly. We have now recombinantly synthesized both mutant proteins and subjected them to comprehensive in vitro assembly experiments. While exhibiting assembly defects when analyzed on their own, both one-to-one mixtures of the respective mutant protein with wild type desmin facilitated proper filament formation. Transient transfection studies complemented this fundamental finding by demonstrating that wild type desmin is also rescuing these assembly defects in vivo. In summary, our findings strongly question the previous hypothesis that it is assembly incompetence due to molecular rearrangements caused by the mutations, which triggers the development of disease. As an alternative, we propose that these mutations cause subtle age-dependent structural alterations of desmin IFs that eventually lead to disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Neutral lipid storage disease comprises a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by systemic accumulation of triglycerides in cytoplasmic droplets. Here we report a neutral lipid storage disease subgroup characterized by mild myopathy, absence of ichthyosis and mutations in both alleles of adipose triglyceride lipase (PNPLA2, also known as ATGL). Three of these mutations are predicted to lead to a truncated ATGL protein with an intact patatin domain containing the active site, but with defects in the hydrophobic domain. The block in triglyceride degradation was mimicked by short interfering RNA directed against ATGL. NLSDM is distinct from Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome, which is characterized by neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis, mild myopathy and hepatomegaly due to mutations in ABHD5 (also known as CGI-58).</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in dysferlin cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B, Miyoshi myopathy and distal anterior compartment myopathy. Dysferlin is proposed to play a role in muscle membrane repair. To gain functional insight into the molecular mechanisms of dysferlin, we have searched for dysferlin-interacting proteins in skeletal muscle. By coimmunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that AHNAK interacts with dysferlin. We defined the binding sites in dysferlin and AHNAK as the C2A domain in dysferlin and the carboxyterminal domain of AHNAK by glutathione S-transferase (GST)-pull down assays. As expected, the N-terminal domain of myoferlin also interacts with the carboxyterminal domain of AHNAK. In normal skeletal muscle, dysferlin and AHNAK colocalize at the sarcolemmal membrane and T-tubules. In dysferlinopathies, reduction or absence of dysferlin correlates with a secondary muscle-specific loss of AHNAK. Moreover, in regenerating rat muscle, dysferlin and AHNAK showed a marked increase and cytoplasmic localization, consistent with the direct interaction between them. Our data suggest that dysferlin participates in the recruitment and stabilization of AHNAK to the sarcolemma and that AHNAK plays a role in dysferlin membrane repair process. It may also have significant implications for understanding the biology of AHNAK-containing exocytotic vesicles, "enlargosomes," in plasma membrane remodeling and repair.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>It was previously shown that mouse Pus1p (mPus1p), a pseudouridine synthase (PUS) known to modify certain transfer RNAs (tRNAs), can also bind with nuclear receptors (NRs) and function as a coactivator through pseudouridylation and likely activation of an RNA coactivator called steroid receptor RNA activator (SRA). Use of cell extract devoid of human Pus1p activity derived from patients with mitochondrial myopathy and sideroblastic anemia, however, still showed SRA-modifying activity suggesting that other PUS(s) can also target this coactivator. Here, we show that related mPus3p, which has a different tRNA specificity than mPus1p, also serves as a NR coactivator. However, in contrast to mPus1p, it does not stimulate sex steroid receptor activity, which is likely due to lack of binding to this class of NRs. As expected from their tRNA activities, in vitro pseudouridylation assays show that mPus3p and mPus1p modify different positions in SRA, although some may be commonly targeted. Interestingly, the order in which these enzymes modify SRA determines the total number of pseudouridines. mPus3p and SRA are mainly cytoplasmic; however, mPus3p and SRA are also localized in distinct nuclear subcompartments. Finally, we identified an in vivo modified position in SRA, U206, which is likely a common target for both mPus1p and mPus3p. When U206 is mutated to A, SRA becomes hyperpseudouridylated in vitro, and it acquires dominant-negative activity in vivo. Thus, Pus1p- and Pus3p-dependent pseudouridylation of SRA is a highly complex posttranscriptional mechanism that controls a coactivator-corepressor switch in SRA with major consequences for NR signaling.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV) or hereditary inclusion myopathy (h-IBM) is an early adult-onset distal myopathy caused by mutations in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene which encodes for a bifunctional enzyme involved in sialic acid biosynthesis. It is pathologically characterized by the presence of rimmed vacuoles especially in atrophic fibers, which also occasionally contain congophilic materials that are immunoreactive to beta-amyloid, lysosomal proteins, ubiquitin and tau proteins. To elucidate the pathomechanism of this myopathy and to explore the treatment options, we generated a mouse model of DMRV/h-IBM. We knocked out the Gne gene in the mouse, but this resulted in embryonic lethality. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse that expressed the human GNEV572L mutation, which is the most prevalent among Japanese DMRV patients, and crossed this with Gne((+/-)) mouse to obtain Gne((-/-))hGNEV572L-Tg. Interestingly, these mice exhibit marked hyposialylation in serum, muscle and other organs. Reduction in motor performance in these mice can only be seen from 30 weeks of age. A compelling finding is the development of beta-amyloid deposition in myofibers by 32 weeks, which clearly precedes rimmed vacuole formation at 42 weeks. These results show that the Gne((-/-)) hGNEV572L-Tg mouse mimics the clinical, histopathological and biochemical features of DMRV/h-IBM, making it useful for understanding the pathomechanism of this myopathy and for employing different strategies for therapy. Our findings underscore the notion that hyposialylation plays an important role in the pathomechanism of DMRV/h-IBM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a congenital myopathy characterized by muscle weakness and nemaline bodies in affected myofibers. Five NM genes, all encoding components of the sarcomeric thin filament, are known. We report identification of a sixth gene, CFL2, encoding the actin-binding protein muscle cofilin-2, which is mutated in two siblings with congenital myopathy. The proband's muscle contained characteristic nemaline bodies, as well as occasional fibers with minicores, concentric laminated bodies, and areas of F-actin accumulation. Her affected sister's muscle was reported to exhibit nonspecific myopathic changes. Cofilin-2 levels were significantly lower in the proband's muscle, and the mutant protein was less soluble when expressed in Escherichia coli, suggesting that deficiency of cofilin-2 may result in reduced depolymerization of actin filaments, causing their accumulation in nemaline bodies, minicores, and, possibly, concentric laminated bodies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The Coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), a cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is usually confined to the sarcolemma at the neuromuscular junction in mature skeletal muscle fibers. Previously, we reported that adenovirus-mediated gene transfer is greatly facilitated in hemizygous transgenic mice with extrasynaptic CAR expression driven by a muscle-specific promoter. However, in the present study, when these mice were bred to homozygosity, they developed a severe myopathic phenotype and died prematurely. Large numbers of necrotic and regenerating fibers were present in the skeletal muscle of the homozygous CAR transgenics. The myopathy was further characterized by increased levels of caveolin-3 and beta-dystroglycan and decreased levels of dystrophin, dysferlin, and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase. Even the hemizygotes manifested a subtle phenotype, displaying deficits in isometric force generation and perturbed mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK-erk1/2) activation during contraction. There are few naturally occurring or engineered mouse lines showing as severe a skeletal myopathy as observed with ectopic expression of CAR in the homozygotes. Taken together, these findings suggest that substantial overexpression of CAR may lead to physiological dysfunction by disturbing sarcolemmal integrity (through dystrophin deficiency), impairing sarcolemmal repair (through dysferlin deficiency), and interfering with normal signaling (through alterations in caveolin-3 and neuronal nitric-oxide synthase levels).</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Patients with long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency manifest hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, hypotonia, lactic acidemia, acute renal failure, cardiomyopathy, and sudden death. We describe four novel mutations of the alpha- and beta-subunits of the mitochondrial trifunctional protein in four patients from three unrelated families. Their plasma acylcarnitine profiles suggested the presence of LCHAD deficiency by demonstrating highly elevated 3-hydroxyacyl carnitines by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Patients 1 and 2 had siblings who had died of lactic acidemia during the neonatal period. These patients also manifested lactic acidemia and died in the neonatal period. Patient 3 had a family history of Reye-like syndrome. She exhibited acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, pericardial effusion, and myopathy at the age of 12 years. DNA analysis of patients 1 and 2 revealed homozygosity for a c.1689+2T>G mutation of the HADHA gene, resulting in the skipping of exon 16 with an in-frame 69-bp deletion. Patient 3 was a compound heterozygosity of the HADHB gene, N307D/N389D. Patient 4, a 25-month-old baby, manifested recurrent episodes of lethargy, metabolic acidosis, elevated liver enzymes, and dark urine from the age of 10 months. Mutation analysis of the HADHB gene of patient 4 identified compound heterozygosity of N114D/N307D.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the gene coding for selenoprotein N (SelN), a selenium containing protein of unknown function, cause different forms of congenital muscular dystrophy in humans. These muscular diseases are characterized by early onset of hypotonia which predominantly affect in axial muscles. We used zebrafish as a model system to understand the function of SelN in muscle formation during embryogenesis. Zebrafish SelN is highly homologous to its human counterpart and amino acids corresponding to the mutated positions in human muscle diseases are conserved in the zebrafish protein. The sepn1 gene is highly expressed in the somites and notochord during early development. Inhibition of the sepn1 gene by injection of antisense morpholinos does not alter the fate of the muscular tissue, but causes muscle architecture disorganization and greatly reduced motility. Ultrastructural analysis of the myotomes reveals defects in muscle sarcomeric organization and in myofibers attachment, as well as altered myoseptum integrity. These studies demonstrate the important role of SelN for muscle organization during early development. Moreover, alteration of myofibrils architecture and tendon-like structure in embryo deficient for SelN function provide new insights into the pathological mechanism of SelN-related myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myosin storage myopathy/hyaline body myopathy is a rare congenital myopathy, with less than 30 cases reported in the literature. It is characterised by the presence of subsarcolemmal hyaline bodies in type 1 muscle fibres and predominantly proximal muscle weakness. Recently, a single mutation (Arg1845Trp) in the slow/beta-cardiac myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7) was identified in four unrelated probands from Sweden and Belgium. The clinical severity and age of onset was variable, despite the same disease-causing mutation and similar histological findings. Here, we report the clinical and morphological findings of two brothers of English/Scottish background with the Arg1845Trp mutation in MYH7. This case report adds to the clinical description of this rare disorder and confirms that Arg1845Trp is a common mutation associated with this phenotype, at least in the White European population.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Sialic acids (Sia) are expressed as terminal sugars in many glycoconjugates. They are involved in a variety of cell-cell interactions and therefore play an important role during development and regeneration. UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) is the key enzyme in the de novo synthesis of Sia and it is a regulator of cell surface sialylation. Inactivation of GNE in mice results in early embryonic lethality. Mutations in the GNE gene are of clinical relevance in hereditary inclusion body myopathy, but these mutations do not necessarily decrease the enzymatic activity of GNE. In this study, we searched for novel function of the GNE protein beside its enzymatic function in the Sia biosynthesis. We here report the identification of novel GNE-interacting proteins. Using a human prey matrix we identified four proteins interacting with GNE in a yeast two-hybrid assay. For two of them, the collapsin response mediator protein 1 and the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein, we could verify protein-protein interaction with GNE.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A search for emerin and lamin A/C (LMNA) mutations was performed in a group of 63 unrelated patients with probable Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) and other MD's with concomitant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP). Four different emerin mutations and 7 LMNA mutations were found in unrelated patients. One emerin mutation and 2 LMNA mutations, one of the latter being found twice, have been registered earlier; the rest of the mutations are novel. All the patients with emerin mutations and 3 patients with LMNA mutations represented single cases while 4 LMNA-related cases were familial. De novo origin was proved for one emerin and 3 LMNA mutations. Apart from EDMD phenotypes, varying also in age at onset and severity, 2 cases of limb girdle MD type 1B were diagnosed. One patient with LMNA mutation and severe DCMP had subclinical signs of skeletal myopathy only. There was an overlap between DCMP type 1A and MD's. Autosomal dominant EDMD seems to be more common than "classic" X-linked EDMD. We found neither emerin nor LMNA mutations in a subset of families with EDMD-like phenotypes that may imply an existence of other genes causing similar disorders. Taking into account clinical variability of MD's caused by emerin and LMNA mutations, DNA diagnosis should not confine to the "classic" phenotype. DNA diagnosis of EDMD is important boht for medical genetic counseling and for patients' management: timely diagnosis of the disease allows one to prevent fatal cardiologic complications.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To investigate possible associations of HLA polymorphisms with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) in African Americans, and to compare this with HLA associations in European American IIM patients with IIM. METHODS: Molecular genetic analyses of HLA-A, B, Cw, DRB1, and DQA1 polymorphisms were performed in a large population of African American patients with IIM (n = 262) in whom the major clinical and autoantibody subgroups were represented. These data were compared with similar information previously obtained from European American patients with IIM (n = 571). RESULTS: In contrast to European American patients with IIM, African American patients with IIM, in particular those with polymyositis, had no strong disease associations with HLA alleles of the 8.1 ancestral haplotype; however, African Americans with dermatomyositis or with anti-Jo-1 autoantibodies shared the risk factor HLA-DRB1*0301 with European Americans. We detected novel HLA risk factors in African American patients with myositis overlap (DRB1*08) and in African American patients producing anti-signal recognition particle (DQA1*0102) and anti-Mi-2 autoantibodies (DRB1*0302). DRB1*0302 and the European American-, anti-Mi-2-associated risk factor DRB1*0701 were found to share a 4-amino-acid sequence motif, which was predicted by comparative homology analyses to have identical 3-dimensional orientations within the peptide-binding groove. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that North American IIM patients from different ethnic groups have both shared and distinct immunogenetic susceptibility factors, depending on the clinical phenotype. These findings, obtained from the largest cohort of North American minority patients with IIM studied to date, add additional support to the hypothesis that the myositis syndromes comprise multiple, distinct disease entities, perhaps arising from divergent pathogenic mechanisms and/or different gene-environment interactions.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotilin, palladin, and myopalladin form a novel small subfamily of cytoskeletal proteins that contain immunoglobulin-like domains. Myotilin is a thin filament-associated protein localized at the Z-disk of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. The direct binding to F-actin, efficient cross-linking of actin filaments, and prevention of induced disassembly of filaments are key roles of myotilin that are thought to be involved in structural maintenance and function of the sarcomere. Missense mutations in the myotilin-encoding gene cause dominant limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 1A and spheroid body myopathy and are the molecular defect that can cause myofibrillar myopathy. Here we describe the generation and analysis of mice that lack myotilin, myo(-/-) mice. Surprisingly, myo(-/-) mice maintain normal muscle sarcomeric and sarcolemmal integrity. Also, loss of myotilin does not cause alterations in the heart or other organs of newborn or adult myo(-/-) mice. The mice develop normally and have a normal life span, and their muscle capacity does not significantly differ from wild-type mice even after prolonged physical stress. The results suggest that either myotilin does not participate in muscle development and basal function maintenance or other proteins serve as structural and functional compensatory molecules when myotilin is absent.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>INTRODUCTION: Myopathy, lactic acidosis and sideroblastic anaemia (MLASA) is a rare condition that combines early-onset myopathy with lactic acidosis and sideroblastic anaemia. MLASA has been associated with a missense mutation in pseudouridylate synthase 1 (PUS1), an enzyme located in both nucleus and mitochondria, which converts uridine into pseudouridine in several cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNA positions and increases the efficiency of protein synthesis in both compartments. Subjects and METHODS: We have identified two Italian brothers, offspring of distantly related parents, both of whom are affected by MLASA. The six exons of the PUS1 gene were analysed by automated sequencing. RESULTS: We found combined defects in mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in muscle and fibroblast homogenates of both patients, and low levels of mtDNA translation products in fibroblast mitochondria. A novel, homozygous stop mutation was present in PUS1 (E220X). We have investigated the structural and mechanistic aspects of the double localisation of PUS1, demonstrating that the isoform located in the nucleus contains an N-terminal extension which is absent in the mature mitochondrial isoform. CONCLUSIONS: The stop mutation in PUS1 is likely to determine the loss of function of the protein, since it predicts the synthesis of a protein missing 208/427 amino acid residues on the C terminus, and was associated with low mtDNA translation. The structural differences in nuclear versus mitochondrial isoforms of PUS1 may be implicated in the variability of the clinical presentations in MLASA.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) is a group of hereditary muscle diseases with preferential involvement of the shoulder and pelvic girdle muscles, but with no pathognomonic features as in facioscapulohumeral and congenital muscular dystrophies. We report 18-year-old female with progressive shoulder and pelvic muscle weakness. She had marked restrictive pulmonary dysfunction. Echocardiogram showed mild decrease in ejection fraction of 52% (normal: >55%). She was first seen in our hospital at age 2 years with progressive proximal muscle weakness and elevated creatine kinase (CK) level to 15,290 IU/L, with what clinically and pathologically appeared to be steroid-responsive inflammatory myopathy. She responded dramatically to steroid therapy. Progressive proximal muscle weakness began again at age 8 years. Serum CK was 14,910 IU/L. She was wheelchair-bound by age 12. Muscle biopsy showed dystrophic changes without inflammation with reduced immunoreactivity to an antibody against sugar chain (VIA4-1) of alpha-dystroglycan. On laminin overlay assay, there was a nearly complete loss of laminin-binding activity to alpha-dystroglycan. Genetic analysis of fukutin-related protein (FKRP) gene revealed a novel compound heterozygous mutation of c.823C>T (p.R275C) and c.948delC, confirming the diagnosis of LGMD2I, the first reported case in East Asia.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In eukaryotic cells, phosphoinositides are lipid second messengers important for many cellular processes and have been found dysregulated in several human diseases. X-linked myotubular (centronuclear) myopathy is a severe congenital myopathy caused by mutations in a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) phosphatase called myotubularin, and mutations in dominant centronuclear myopathy (CNM) cases were identified in the dynamin 2 gene. The genes mutated in autosomal recessive cases of CNMs have not been found. We have identified a novel phosphoinositide phosphatase (hJUMPY) conserved through evolution, which dephosphorylates the same substrates as myotubularin, PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,5)P(2), in vitro and ex vivo. We found, in sporadic cases of CNMs, two missense variants that affect the enzymatic function. One of these appeared de novo in a patient also carrying a de novo mutation in the dynamin 2 gene. The other missense (R336Q) found in another patient changes the catalytic arginine residue of the core phosphatase signature present in protein tyrosine/dual-specificity phosphatases and in phosphoinositide phosphatases and drastically reduces the enzymatic activity both in vitro and in transfected cells. The inheritance of the phenotype with regard to this variant is still unclear and could be either recessive with an undetected second allele or digenic. We propose that impairment of hJUMPY function is implicated in some cases of autosomal CNM and that hJUMPY cooperates with myotubularin to regulate the level of phosphoinositides in skeletal muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The pathogenic events leading to the progressive muscle weakness in patients with a E706K mutation in the head of the myosin heavy chain (MyHC) IIa were analyzed at the muscle cell and motor protein levels. Contractile properties were measured in single muscle fiber segments using the skinned fiber preparation and a single muscle fiber in vitro motility assay. A dramatic impairment in the function of the IIa MyHC isoform was observed at the motor protein level. At the single muscle fiber level, on the other hand, a general decrease was observed in the number of preparations where the specific criteria for acceptance were fulfilled irrespective of MyHC isoform expression. Our results provide evidence that the pathogenesis of the MyHC IIa E706K myopathy involves defective function of the mutated myosin as well as alterations in the structural integrity of all muscle cells irrespective of MyHC isoform expression.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a congenital muscle disorder caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene. Affected males usually present at birth with severe hypotonia and respiratory insufficiency, and most of them die within the first few years of life. We report here on a 68-year-old patient with a very mild form of the disease who was diagnosed after his grandson showed muscular weakness and respiratory problems at birth. The E404K mutation in the MTM1 gene was found in both patients. To our knowledge, this grandfather is one of the oldest and most mildly affected known patients with an MTM1 mutation to date. Thus, this family represents a remarkable phenotypic variation of XLMTM ranging from a congenital to a mild adult form.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Many muscular and neurological disorders are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and are often accompanied by changes in mitochondrial morphology. Mutations in the gene encoding OPA1, a protein required for fusion of mitochondria, are associated with hereditary autosomal dominant optic atrophy type I. Here we show that mitochondrial fragmentation correlates with processing of large isoforms of OPA1 in cybrid cells from a patient with myoclonus epilepsy and ragged-red fibers syndrome and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts harboring an error-prone mitochondrial mtDNA polymerase gamma. Furthermore, processed OPA1 was observed in heart tissue derived from heart-specific TFAM knock-out mice suffering from mitochondrial cardiomyopathy and in skeletal muscles from patients suffering from mitochondrial myopathies such as myopathy encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes. Dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential leads to fast induction of proteolytic processing of OPA1 and concomitant fragmentation of mitochondria. Recovery of mitochondrial fusion depended on protein synthesis and was accompanied by resynthesis of large isoforms of OPA1. Fragmentation of mitochondria was prevented by overexpressing OPA1. Taken together, our data indicate that proteolytic processing of OPA1 has a key role in inducing fragmentation of energetically compromised mitochondria. We present the hypothesis that this pathway regulates mitochondrial morphology and serves as an early response to prevent fusion of dysfunctional mitochondria with the functional mitochondrial network.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlin is a large sarcolemmal protein implicated in the repair of surface membrane tears in muscle cells. Mutations in dysferlin result in limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and Miyoshi myopathy. Using a cDNA based approach we identified eight new pathogenic dysferlin alleles. To better understand how missense mutations could lead to reduced or absent dysferlin expression levels, we mapped missense mutations from our own and from published databases (n=55) to the secondary protein structure of dysferlin, deduced by computerized structural prediction tools. We found the protein to be very sensitive to the alteration of residues that were predicted to be buried inside the protein structure. We identified seven putative C2 domains, one more than commonly reported, of both type I and type II topology in dysferlin. Missense mutations often affected those structures as well as residues that were highly conserved between members of the ferlin family. Thus, alteration of structurally important residues in dysferlin could lead to improper folding and degradation of the mutant protein.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathy is a rare disorder of varying severity and genetic etiology. We present two cases, a father and son, with a novel missense mutation in the alpha actin gene. Both have a history of early motor impairment, with the son's course being considerably more severe. This pair illustrates the clinical variability of nemaline myopathy, highlighting the possible influence of environmental and epigenetic factors. Implications for the current classification system and prognosis are discussed.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nonmuscle gamma(cyto)-actin is expressed at very low levels in skeletal muscle but uniquely localizes to costameres, the cytoskeletal networks that couple peripheral myofibrils to the sarcolemma. We generated and analyzed skeletal muscle-specific gamma(cyto)-actin knockout (Actg1-msKO) mice. Although muscle development proceeded normally, Actg1-msKO mice presented with overt muscle weakness accompanied by a progressive pattern of muscle fiber necrosis/regeneration. Functional deficits in whole-body tension and isometric twitch force were observed, consistent with defects in the connectivity between muscle fibers and/or myofibrils or at the myotendinous junctions. Surprisingly, gamma(cyto)-actin-deficient muscle did not demonstrate the fibrosis, inflammation, and membrane damage typical of several muscular dystrophies but rather presented with a novel progressive myopathy. Together, our data demonstrate an important role for minimally abundant but strategically localized gamma(cyto)-actin in adult skeletal muscle and describe a new mouse model to study the in vivo relevance of subcellular actin isoform sorting.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report on a 2-year-old male child with both nemaline myopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Sequencing of the ACTA1 gene showed a "de novo" missense heterozygous mutation a>g in exon 7 (Lys336Glu). Two-dimensional electrophoresis showed 28% mutant actin present in his muscle biopsy. Actin was isolated from the muscle biopsy and examined by in vitro motility assay. The sliding speed was 13+/-3% less than normal and the affinity of actin for the Z-line protein alpha-actinin was reduced 10 fold. This is the first report on a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy associated with nemaline myopathy and an ACTA1 mutation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Most nemaline myopathy patients have mutations in the nebulin (NEB) or skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) genes. Here we report for the first time three patients with severe nemaline myopathy and mutations of the ACTA1 stop codon: TAG>TAT (tyrosine), TAG>CAG (glutamine) and TAG>TGG (tryptophan). All three mutations will cause inclusion of an additional 47 amino acids, translated from the 3' UTR of the gene, into the mature actin protein. Western blotting of one patient's muscle demonstrated the presence of the larger protein, while expression of one of the other mutant proteins fused to EGFP in C2C12 cells demonstrated the formation of rod bodies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Bcl-2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) is a member of a conserved family of cyto-protective proteins that bind to and regulate Hsp70 family molecular chaperones. Here, we show that BAG3 is prominently expressed in striated muscle and colocalizes with Z-disks. Mice with homozygous disruption of the bag3 gene developed normally but deteriorated postnatally with stunted growth evident by 1 to 2 weeks of age and death by 4 weeks. BAG3-deficient animals developed a fulminant myopathy characterized by noninflammatory myofibrillar degeneration with apoptotic features. Knockdown of bag3 expression in cultured C2C12 myoblasts increased apoptosis on induction of differentiation, suggesting a need for bag3 for maintenance of myotube survival and confirming a cell autonomous role for bag3 in muscle. We conclude that although BAG3 is not required for muscle development, this co-chaperone appears to be critically important for maintenance of mature skeletal muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder of skeletal muscle caused by mutations in at least five different genes encoding thin filament proteins of the striated muscle sarcomere. We have previously described 18 different mutations in the last 42 exons of the nebulin gene (NEB) in 18 families with NM. Here we report 45 novel NEB mutations detected by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) and sequence analysis of all 183 NEB exons in NM patients from 44 families. Altogether we have identified, including the deletion of exon 55 identified in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, 64 different mutations in NEB segregating with autosomal recessive NM in 55 families. The majority (55%) of the mutations in NEB are frameshift or nonsense mutations predicted to cause premature truncation of nebulin. Point mutations (25%) or deletions (3%) affecting conserved splice signals are predicted in the majority of cases to cause in-frame exon skipping, possibly leading to impaired nebulin-tropomyosin interaction along the thin filament. Patients in 18 families had one of nine missense mutations (14%) affecting conserved amino acids at or in the vicinity of actin or tropomyosin binding sites. In addition, we found the exon 55 deletion in four families. The majority of the patients (in 49/55 families) were shown to be compound heterozygous for two different mutations. The mutations were found in both constitutively and alternatively expressed exons throughout the NEB gene, and there were no obvious mutational hotspots. Patients with more severe clinical pictures tended to have mutations predicted to be more disruptive than patients with milder forms.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The precise assembly of the highly organized filament systems found in muscle is critically important for its function. It has been hypothesized that nebulin, a giant filamentous protein extending along the entire length of the thin filament, provides a blueprint for muscle thin filament assembly. To test this hypothesis, we generated a KO mouse model to investigate nebulin functions in vivo. Nebulin KO mice assemble thin filaments of reduced lengths and approximately 15% of their Z-disks are abnormally wide. Our data demonstrate that nebulin functions in vivo as a molecular ruler by specifying pointed- and barbed-end thin filament capping. Consistent with the shorter thin filament length of nebulin deficient mice, maximal active tension was significantly reduced in KO animals. Phenotypically, the murine model recapitulates human nemaline myopathy (NM), that is, the formation of nemaline rods combined with severe skeletal muscle weakness. The myopathic changes in the nebulin KO model include depressed contractility, loss of myopalladin from the Z-disk, and dysregulation of genes involved in calcium homeostasis and glycogen metabolism; features potentially relevant for understanding human NM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the dysferlin (DYSF) gene are associated with limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and Miyoshi myopathy. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a novel dysferlin transcript that we named DYSF_v1 (GenBank accession: DQ267935). This transcript differs from the currently known dysferlin transcript (GenBank accession: AF075575) in the sequence of the entire first exon which spans 232 bases. This unique first exon is derived from intron 1 of DYSF, and has an immediate upstream 5' untranslated region containing CpG islands and sequences consistent with transcription factor binding sites. Exon 1 of DYSF_v1 shares 85% sequence homology and has similar genomic organization with the first exon of mouse dysferlin. Northern blot analysis showed that the DYSF_v1 transcript spans 7.5 kb and is expressed in human skeletal muscle, heart, placenta, brain, spleen, kidney, intestine, and lung tissues. DYSF_v1 retains phylogenic conservancy and shows similar expression pattern as the currently known human dysferlin.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We have identified compound heterozygous missense mutations in POLG1, encoding the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (Pol gamma), in 7 children with progressive encephalopathy from 5 unrelated families. The clinical features in 6 of the children included psychomotor regression, refractory seizures, stroke-like episodes, hepatopathy, and ataxia compatible with Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome. Three families harbored a previously reported A467T substitution, which was found in compound with the earlier described G848S or the W748S substitution or a novel R574W substitution. Two families harbored the W748S change in compound with either of 2 novel mutations predicted to give an R232H or M1163R substitution. Muscle morphology showed mitochondrial myopathy with cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-deficient fibers in 4 patients. mtDNA analyses in muscle tissue revealed mtDNA depletion in 3 of the children and mtDNA deletions in the 2 sibling pairs. Neuropathologic investigation in 3 children revealed widespread cortical degeneration with gliosis and subcortical neuronal loss, especially in the thalamus, whereas there were only subcortical neurodegenerative findings in another child. The results support the concept that deletions as well as depletion of mtDNA are involved in the pathogenesis of Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome and add 3 new POLG1 mutations associated with an early-onset neurodegenerative disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The manner in which Ca2+-sensitive signaling proteins are activated in contracting cardiomyocytes is an intriguing theoretical problem given that the cytoplasm is continually bathed with systolic Ca2+ concentrations that should maximally activate most Ca2+-sensitive signaling kinases and phosphatases. Store-operated Ca2+ entry, partially attributed to transient receptor potential (TRP) proteins, can mediate activation of the Ca2+-sensitive phosphatase calcineurin in nonexcitable cells. Here we investigated the gain-of-function phenotype associated with TRPC3 expression in the mouse heart using transgenesis to examine the potential role of store-operated Ca2+ entry in regulating cardiac calcineurin activation and ensuing hypertrophy/myopathy. Adult myocytes isolated from TRPC3 transgenic mice showed abundant store-operated Ca2+ entry that was inhibited with SKF96365 but not verapamil or KB-R7943. Associated with this induction in store-operated Ca2+ entry, TRPC3 transgenic mice showed increased calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activation in vivo, cardiomyopathy, and increased hypertrophy after neuroendocrine agonist or pressure overload stimulation. The cardiomyopathic phenotype and increased hypertrophy after pressure overload stimulation were blocked by targeted disruption of the calcineurin Abeta gene. Thus, enhanced store-operated Ca2+ entry in the heart can regulate calcineurin-NFAT signaling in vivo, which could secondarily impact the hypertrophic response and cardiomyopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A frequent finding in patients surviving critical illness myopathy is chronic muscle dysfunction. Its pathogenesis is mostly unknown; one explanation could be that muscle regeneration, which normally follows myopathy, is insufficient in these patients because of a high glucocorticoid level in their blood. Glucocorticoids can prevent stimulatory effects of proinflammatory factors on the interleukin (IL)-6 secretion, diminishing in this way the autocrine and paracrine IL-6 actions known to stimulate proliferation at the earliest, myoblast stage of muscle formation. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effects of major proinflammatory agents [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] on the IL-6 secretion from the muscle precursors and then studied the influence of dexamethasone (Dex) on these effects. Mononuclear myoblasts, which still proliferate, were compared with myotubes in which this capacity is already lost. For correct interpretation of results, cultures were examined for putative apoptosis and necrosis. We found that constitutive secretion of IL-6 did not differ significantly between myoblasts and myotubes; however, the TNF-alpha- and LPS-stimulated IL-6 release was more pronounced (P &lt; 0.001) in myoblasts. Dex, applied at the 0.1-100 nM concentration range, prevented constitutive and TNF-alpha- and LPS-stimulated IL-6 release at both developmental stages but only at high concentration (P &lt; 0.01). Although there are still missing links to it, our results support the concept that high concentrations of glucocorticoids, met in critically ill patients, prevent TNF-alpha- and LPS-stimulated IL-6 secretion. This results in reduced IL-6-mediated myoblast proliferation, leading to the reduced final mass of the regenerated muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Barth syndrome is an X-linked disease presenting with cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle weakness. It is caused by mutations in tafazzin, a putative acyl transferase that has been associated with altered metabolism of the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin. To investigate the molecular basis of Barth syndrome, we created Drosophila melanogaster mutants, resulting from imprecise excision of a P element inserted upstream of the coding region of the tafazzin gene. Homozygous flies for that mutation were unable to express the full-length isoform of tafazzin, as documented by RNA and Western blot analysis, but two shorter tafazzin transcripts were still present, although the expression levels of their encoded proteins were too low to be detectable by Western blotting. The tafazzin mutation caused an 80% reduction of cardiolipin and a diversification of its molecular composition, similar to the changes seen in Barth patients. Other phospholipids, like phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, were not affected. Flies with the tafazzin mutation showed a reduced locomotor activity, measured in flying and climbing assays, and their indirect flight muscles displayed frequent mitochondrial abnormalities, mostly in the cristae membranes. Thus, tafazzin mutations in Drosophila generated a Barth-related phenotype, with the triad of abnormal cardiolipin, pathologic mitochondria, and motor weakness, suggesting causal links between these findings. We conclude that a lack of full-length tafazzin is responsible for the cardiolipin deficiency, which is integral to the disease mechanism, leading to mitochondrial myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>It has been documented that mutations in the human desmin gene lead to a severe type of myofibrillar myopathy, termed more specifically desminopathy, which affects cardiac and skeletal as well as smooth muscle. We showed recently that 14 recombinant versions of these disease-causing desmin variants, all involving single amino acid substitutions in the alpha-helical rod domain, interfere with in vitro filament formation at distinct stages of the assembly process. We now provide mechanistic details of how these mutations affect the filament assembly process by employing analytical ultracentrifugation, time-lapse electron microscopy of negatively stained and glycerol-sprayed/low-angle rotary metal-shadowed samples, quantitative scanning transmission electron microscopy, and viscometric studies. In particular, the soluble assembly intermediates of two of the mutated proteins exhibit unusually high s-values, compatible with octamers and other higher-order complexes. Moreover, several of the six filament-forming mutant variants deviated considerably from wild-type desmin with respect to their filament diameters and mass-per-length values. In the heteropolymeric situation with wild-type desmin, four of the mutant variants caused a pronounced "hyper-assembly", when assayed by viscometry. This indicates that the various mutations may cause abortion of filament formation by the mutant protein at distinct stages, and that some of them interfere severely with the assembly of wild-type desmin. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the basic intermediate filament assembly mechanisms and offer clues as to how amino acid changes within the desmin rod domain may interfere with the normal structural organization of the muscle cytoskeleton, eventually leading to desminopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the NOTCH3 gene cause cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), which is clinically characterised by recurrent ischemic strokes, migraine with aura, psychiatric symptoms, cognitive decline and dementia. We have previously described a patient with CADASIL caused by a R133C mutation in the NOTCH3 gene and with a concomitant myopathy caused by a 5650G>A mutation in the MTTA gene in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). We assume that the co-occurrence of the two mutations is not coincidental and that mutations in the NOTCH3 gene may predispose the mtDNA to mutations. We therefore examined the nucleotide variation in the mtDNA coding region sequences in 20 CADASIL pedigrees with 77 affected patients by conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The sequence variation in mtDNA was then compared with that among 192 healthy Finns. A total of 180 mtDNA coding region sequence differences were found relative to the revised Cambridge reference sequence, including five novel synonymous substitutions, two novel nonsynonymous substitutions and one novel tRNA substitution. We found that maternal relatives in two pedigrees differed from each other in their mtDNA. Furthermore, the average number of pairwise differences in sequences from the 41 unrelated maternal lineages with CADASIL was higher than that expected among haplogroup-matched controls. The numbers of polymorphic sites and polymorphisms that were present in only one sequence were also higher among the CADASIL sequences than among the control sequences. Our results show that mtDNA sequence variation is increased within CADASIL pedigrees. These findings suggest a relationship between NOTCH3 and mtDNA.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotilin is a muscle-specific Z-disc protein with putative roles in myofibril assembly and structural upkeep of the sarcomere. Several myotilin point mutations have been described in patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1A (LGMD1A), myofibrillar myopathy (MFM), spheroid body myopathy (SBM), three similar adult-onset, progressive and autosomal dominant muscular dystrophies. To further investigate myotilin's role in the pathogenesis of these muscle diseases, we have characterized three independent lines of transgenic mice expressing mutant (T57I) myotilin under the control of the human skeletal actin promoter. Similar to LGMD1A and MFM patients, these mice develop progressive myofibrillar pathology that includes Z-disc streaming, excess myofibrillar vacuolization and plaque-like myofibrillar aggregation. These aggregates become progressively larger and more numerous with age. We show that the mutant myotilin protein properly localizes to the Z-disc and also heavily populates the aggregates, along with several other Z-disc associated proteins. Whole muscle physiological analysis reveals that the extensor digitorum longus muscle of transgenic mice exhibits significantly reduced maximum specific isometric force compared with littermate controls. Intriguingly, the soleus and diaphragm muscles are spared of any abnormal myopathology and show no reductions in maximum specific force. These data provide evidence that myotilin mutations promote aggregate-dependent contractile dysfunction. In sum, we have established a promising patho-physiological mouse model that unifies the phenotypes of LGMD1A, MFM and SBM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Barth syndrome is an X-linked disorder characterized by cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, neutropenia, organic aciduria, and growth retardation caused by mutations in tafazzin. The sequence similarity of tafazzin to acyltransferases suggests a role in mitochondrial phospholipid metabolism. To study the role of tafazzin in heart function and development, we created a knockdown zebrafish model. Zebrafish tafazzin mRNA is first evident at 7 hours post-fertilization (hpf). At 10 and 24 hpf, tafazzin mRNA is ubiquitous, with highest levels in the head. By 51 hpf, expression becomes cardiac restricted. The tafazzin knockdown created by antisense morpholino yolk injection resulted in dose-dependent lethality, severe developmental and growth retardation, marked bradycardia and pericardial effusions, and generalized edema, signs that resemble human Barth syndrome heart failure. This knockdown phenotype was rescued by concomitant injection of normal tafazzin mRNA. Abnormal cardiac development, with a linear, nonlooped heart, and hypomorphic tail and eye development proves that tafazzin is essential for overall zebrafish development, especially of the heart. The tafazzin knockdown zebrafish provides an animal model similar to Barth syndrome to analyze the severity of human mutants and to test potential treatments.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in titin are well known cause of late onset autosomal dominant distal myopathy. Mutations in another sarcomeric protein, myotilin, were first identified in two families with dominant limb girdle muscular phenotype. Recently, however, myotilin mutations have been associated with more distal phenotypes in patients with late onset myofibrillar myopathy. We report here a multigenerational French family in which gene sequencing identified a S60F myotilin mutation in all patients with full penetrance despite very late onset. The family was originally reported as a distal myopathy but intrafamilial variability was remarkable with proximal or distal muscle weakness or both. Extended morphological characteristics of muscle biopsy findings in myotilinopathy indicate that immunohistochemistry may be important for selection of molecular genetic approach in myofibrillar myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We investigated whether beta-amyloid and tau protein are involved in the formation of inclusion body myositis (IBM)-like inclusions found in children with rimmed vacuoles and congenitally affected muscles. We immunostained muscle biopsy specimens from four children and one 18-year-old boy with congenital myopathy containing rimmed vacuoles and IBM-like inclusions with antibodies against beta-amyloid, tau protein and ubiquitin. Focal accumulations of both beta-amyloid and phosphorylated tau coexisted with tubulofilamentous structures in all cases. Our studies demonstrate for the first time that the full morphological phenotype of IBM including beta-amyloid and tau protein deposits may also develop in children, and that congenital, probably genetic, muscle defects may lead to abnormal protein aggregation in IBM-like inclusions.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) with inclusion body myopathy and Paget disease of bone (IBMPFD) is a rare, autosomal-dominant disorder caused by mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene, a member of the AAA-ATPase gene superfamily. The neuropathology associated with sporadic FTD is heterogeneous and includes tauopathies and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions (FTLD-U). However, there is limited information on the neuropathology in IBMPFD. We performed a detailed, systematic analysis of the neuropathologic changes in 8 patients with VCP mutations. A novel pattern of ubiquitin pathology was identified in IBMPFD that was distinct from sporadic and familial FTLD-U without VCP gene mutations. This was characterized by ubiquitin-positive neuronal intranuclear inclusions and dystrophic neurites. In contrast to FTLD-U, only rare intracytoplasmic inclusions were identified. The ubiquitin pathology was abundant in the neocortex, less robust in limbic and subcortical nuclei, and absent in the dentate gyrus. Only rare inclusions were detected with antibodies to VCP and there was no biochemical alteration in the VCP protein. VCP is associated with a variety of cellular activities, including regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the pathology associated with VCP gene mutations is the result of impairment of ubiquitin-based degradation pathways.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations of selenoprotein N, 1 gene (SEPN1) cause rigid spine with muscular dystrophy type 1 (RSMD1), multiminicore disease, and desmin-related myopathy. We found two novel SEPN1 mutations in two Japanese patients with RSMD1. To clarify the pathomechanism of RSMD1, we performed immunohistochemical studies using a newly developed antibody for selenoprotein N. Selenoprotein N was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm of the control muscle, but was reduced and irregularly expressed in the cytoplasm of a patient with RSMD1. The expression pattern was very similar to that of calnexin, a transmembrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum. Selenoprotein N seems to be an endoplasmic reticulum glycoprotein, and loss of this protein leads to disturbance of muscular function. One of the families had the SEPN1 homozygous mutation in the initiation codon 1_2 ins T in exon 1 and showed truncated protein expression. The other had a homozygous 20-base duplication mutation at 80 (80_99dup, frameshift at R27) which, in theory, should generate many nonsense mutations including TGA. These nonsense mutations are premature translation termination codons and they degrade immediately by the process of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). However, truncated selenoprotein N was also expressed. A possible mechanism behind this observation is that SEPN1 mRNAs may be resistant to NMD. We report on the possible molecular mechanism behind these mutations in SEPN1. Our study clarifies molecular mechanisms of this muscular disorder.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Diabetes leads to a decompensated myopathy, but the etiology of the cardiac disease is poorly understood. Oxidative stress is enhanced with diabetes and oxygen toxicity may alter cardiac progenitor cell (CPC) function resulting in defects in CPC growth and myocyte formation, which may favor premature myocardial aging and heart failure. We report that in a model of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to telomeric shortening, expression of the senescent associated proteins p53 and p16INK4a, and apoptosis of CPCs, impairing the growth reserve of the heart. However, ablation of the p66shc gene prevents these negative adaptations of the CPC compartment, interfering with the acquisition of the heart senescent phenotype and the development of heart failure with diabetes. ROS elicit 3 cellular reactions: low levels activate cell growth, intermediate quantities trigger cell apoptosis, and high amounts initiate cell necrosis. CPC replication predominates in diabetic p66shc-/-, whereas CPC apoptosis and myocyte apoptosis and necrosis prevail in diabetic wild type. Expansion of CPCs and developing myocytes preserves cardiac function in diabetic p66shc-/-, suggesting that intact CPCs can effectively counteract the impact of uncontrolled diabetes on the heart. The recognition that p66shc conditions the destiny of CPCs raises the possibility that diabetic cardiomyopathy is a stem cell disease in which abnormalities in CPCs define the life and death of the heart. Together, these data point to a genetic link between diabetes and ROS, on the one hand, and CPC survival and growth, on the other.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Enzyme deficiencies of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system may be caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or in the nuclear DNA. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the sequences of the mtDNA coding region in 25 patients with OXPHOS system deficiency to identify the underlying genetic defect. RESULTS: Three novel non-synonymous substitutions in protein-coding genes, 4681T-->C in MT-ND2, 9891T-->C in MT-CO3 and 14122A-->G in MT-ND5, and one novel substitution in the 12S rRNA gene, 686A--&gt;G, were found. The definitely pathogenic mutation 3460G-->A was identified in an 18-year-old woman who had severe isolated complex I deficiency and progressive myopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Bioinformatic analyses suggest a pathogenic role for the novel 4681T-->C substitution found in a boy with Leigh's disease. These results show that the clinical phenotype caused by the primary Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy mutation 3460G-->A is more variable than has been thought. In the remaining 23 patients, the role of mtDNA mutations as a cause of the OXPHOS system deficiency could be excluded. The deficiency in these children probably originates from mutations in the nuclear genes coding for respiratory enzyme subunits or assembly factors.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>This paper reports the third proven human case of deficient S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase activity. The patient is similar to the only two previously reported cases with this disorder in having severe myopathy, developmental delay, elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) concentrations, and hypermethioninaemia. Although he has been followed from infancy, the basic enzyme deficiency was established only at age 26 years. The diagnosis was based on markedly elevated plasma concentrations of both AdoHcy and S-adenosylmethionine, some 20% of the mean control activity of AdoHcy hydrolase activity in haemolysates of his red-blood cells, and two missense mutations in his gene encoding AdoHcy hydrolase. He had low values of erythrocyte phosphatidylcholine and plasma free choline and marginally elevated excretion of guanidinoacetate, suggesting that the elevated AdoHcy may have been inhibiting methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine and guanidinoacetate. His leukocyte DNA was globally more methylated than the DNA's of his parents or the mean extent of methylation measured in age-matched control subjects.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Glycogenosis type III (Cori disease) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by the deficiency of the glycogen debranching enzyme, encoded by the AGL gene, and existing in six isoforms alternately spliced in a tissue-specific way. Generally, disease onset occurs early on starting from the first year of life, with hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, increased CK levels, and, in some cases, short stature and slight mental retardation. Frequently, hepatomegaly tends to resolve spontaneously and inexplicably during childhood, when myopathy, often associated with cardiomyopathy, arises. This disease is known to lack almost invariably clear links between the genotype and clinical phenotype. We describe nine new mutations in Italian patients: four nonsense (p.Arg285X, p.Lys422X, p.Arg910X, p.Arg977X), three frameshift (c.442delA, c.753_756delGACA, c.3963delG), and two missense (p.Ala1120Pro, p.Arg524His). Particularly, the nonsense p.Arg285X is linked to an exonic splicing enhancer and it was found to produce two species of transcripts at the same time. Moreover, we discuss a subgroup of subjects carrying c.2681+1G>A, which has proven to be the most frequent mutation among our patients. The previously described c.664+3A>G was also detected in two patients, both homozygous. The present work is yet another confirmation that the individual genetic background plays a pivotal role in influencing the phenotypes, as occurs in other metabolic diseases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the gene encoding dysferlin (DYSF) cause the allelic autosomal recessive disorders limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B and Miyoshi myopathy. It encompasses 55 exons spanning 150 kb of genomic DNA. Dysferlin is involved in membrane repair in skeletal muscle. We identified three families with novel sequence variants in DYSF. All affected family members showed limb girdle weakness and had reduced or absent dysferlin protein on immunohistochemistry. All exons of DYSF were screened by genomic sequencing. Five novel variants in DYSF were found: two missense mutations (c.895G>A and c.4022T>C), one 5' donor splice-site variant (c.855+1delG), one nonsense mutation (c.1448C>A), and a variant in the 3'UTR of DYSF (c.*107T>A). All alterations were confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and not found in 400 control alleles. Nonsense mediated RNA decay or changes in the three-dimensional protein structure resulting in intracellular dysferlin aggregates and finally the lack of dysferlin protein were identified as consequences of the novel DYSF variants.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The dystrophin glycoprotein complex links laminin in the extracellular matrix to the cell cytoskeleton. Loss of dystrophin causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the most common human X-chromosome-linked genetic disease. The alpha7beta1 integrin is a second transmembrane laminin receptor expressed in skeletal muscle. Mutations in the alpha7 integrin gene cause congenital myopathy in humans and mice. The alpha7beta1 integrin is increased in the skeletal muscle of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients and mdx mice. This observation has led to the suggestion that dystrophin and alpha7beta1 integrin have complementary functional and structural roles. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice lacking both dystrophin and alpha7 integrin (mdx/alpha7(-/-)). The mdx/alpha7(-/-) mice developed early-onset muscular dystrophy and died at 2-4 weeks of age. Muscle fibers from mdx/alpha7(-/-) mice exhibited extensive loss of membrane integrity, increased centrally located nuclei and inflammatory cell infiltrate, greater necrosis and increased muscle degeneration compared to mdx or alpha7-integrin null animals. In addition, loss of dystrophin and/or alpha7 integrin resulted in altered expression of laminin-alpha2 chain. These results point to complementary roles for dystrophin and alpha7beta1 integrin in maintaining the functional integrity of skeletal muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotilin (MYOT) is a promising candidate gene for Vocal Cord and Pharyngeal Weakness with Distal Myopathy (VCPDM, also known as MPD2). Located within the minimum VCPDM candidate interval, myotilin mutations also cause a similarly progressive and adult-onset muscle disease. We examined myotilin in VCPDM patients by sequence analysis, RT-PCR, Southern blotting, and western blotting. We detected no defects in the myotilin gene, transcript, or protein in VCPDM. We also report several useful SNPs and STRs for the analysis of myotilin in muscle diseases of suspected, yet unknown genetic origin. We conclude that MYOT mutations likely are not a cause of VCPDM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the gene coding for the catalytic subunit of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) polymerase gamma (POLG1) have recently been described in patients with diverse clinical presentations, revealing a complex relationship between genotype and phenotype in patients and their families. POLG1 was sequenced in patients from different European diagnostic and research centres to define the phenotypic spectrum and advance understanding of the recurrence risks. Mutations were identified in 38 cases, with the majority being sporadic compound heterozygotes. Eighty-nine DNA sequence changes were identified, including 2 predicted to alter a splice site, 1 predicted to cause a premature stop codon and 13 predicted to cause novel amino acid substitutions. The majority of children had a mutation in the linker region, often 1399G-->A (A467T), and a mutation affecting the polymerase domain. Others had mutations throughout the gene, and 11 had 3 or more substitutions. The clinical presentation ranged from the neonatal period to late adult life, with an overlapping phenotypic spectrum from severe encephalopathy and liver failure to late-onset external ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, myopathy and isolated muscle pain or epilepsy. There was a strong gender bias in children, with evidence of an environmental interaction with sodium valproate. POLG1 mutations cause an overlapping clinical spectrum of disease with both dominant and recessive modes of inheritance. 1399G-->A (A467T) is common in children, but complete POLG1 sequencing is required to identify multiple mutations that can have complex implications for genetic counselling.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the dysferlin gene underlie two phenotypically distinct muscular dystrophies: Miyoshi myopathy and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 2B. Dysferlin was proposed to have a putative functional role in mediating the fusion of intracellular vesicles to the sarcolemma during injury-induced membrane repair, but dysferlin has been found not only at the sarcolemma but also within the cytoplasm of skeletal muscle fibers by immunohistochemistry. In this study, we examined the subcellular localization of dysferlin in skeletal muscle by immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses to elucidate other functional roles of dysferlin. Immunohistochemistry confirmed granular cytoplasmic expression pattern of dysferlin in muscle fibers. Subcellular membrane fractionation revealed that a portion of dysferlin associated with a T-tubule-enriched intracellular membrane fraction as well as a sarcolemmal fraction. This indication was consistent with subsequent results that dysferlin coprecipitates by immunoprecipitation with the dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR), a protein complex localized in T-tubules. Moreover, both proteins were observed to partially colocalize by double immunofluorescent labeling in skeletal muscle fibers. We also found that caveolin-3, previously shown to interact with dysferlin, coprecipitates with DHPR. These results demonstrated that dysferlin may be involved in the formation of an oligomeric complex with DHPR and caveolin-3. Caveolin-3 has been also reported to participate in an insulin-regulated transport mechanism in muscle, and caveolin-3-containing vesicles might traffic between intracellular sites and target sites on the sarcolemma and T-tubules. Therefore, it is very intriguing to assume that dysferlin might be involved in the fusion of caveolin-3-containing vesicles with T-tubules.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The authors found that the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is hyposialylated in hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) muscle, as suggested by its decreased molecular weight by Western blot. This abnormality represented the only pathologic feature differentiating HIBM due to GNE mutations from other myopathies with similar clinical and pathologic characteristics. If further confirmed in larger series of patients, this may be a useful diagnostic marker of GNE-related HIBM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome, caused by mutations in subunits of the endplate ACh receptor (AChR), results in prolonged synaptic currents and excitotoxic injury of the postsynaptic region by Ca2+ overloading. The Ca2+ overloading could be due entirely to the prolonged openings of the AChR channel or could be abetted by enhanced Ca2+ permeability of the mutant channels. We therefore measured the fractional Ca2+ current, defined as the percentage of the total ACh-evoked current carried by Ca2+ ions (Pf), for AChRs harbouring the alphaG153S or the alphaV249F slow-channel mutation, and for wild-type human AChRs in which Pf has not yet been determined. Experiments were performed in transiently transfected GH4C1 cells and human myotubes with simultaneous recording of ACh-evoked whole-cell currents and fura-2 fluorescence signals. We found that the Pf of the wild-type human endplate AChR was unexpectedly high (Pf approximately 7%), but neither the alphaV249F nor the alphaG153S mutation altered Pf. Fetal human AChRs containing either the wild-type or the mutated alpha subunit had a much lower Pf (2-3%). We conclude that the Ca2+ permeability of human endplate AChRs is higher than that reported for any other human nicotinic AChR, with the exception of alpha7-containing AChRs (Pf > 10%); and that neither the alphaG153S nor the alphaV249F mutations affect the Pf of fetal or adult endplate AChRs. However, the intrinsically high Ca2+ permeability of human AChRs probably predisposes to development of the endplate myopathy when opening events of the AChR channel are prolonged by altered AChR-channel kinetics.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The aim of this study was to investigate HLA class II associations in polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM), and to determine how these associations influence clinical and serological differences. DNA samples were obtained from 225 UK Caucasian idiopathic inflammatory myopathy patients (PM = 117, DM = 108) and compared with 537 randomly selected UK Caucasian controls. All cases had also been assessed for the presence of related malignancy and interstitial lung disease (ILD), and a number of myositis-specific/myositis-associated antibodies (MSAs/MAAs). Subjects were genotyped for HLA-DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1. HLA-DRB1*03, DQA1*05 and DQB1*02 were associated with an increased risk for both PM and DM. The HLA-DRB1*03-DQA1*05-DQB1*02 haplotype demonstrated strong association with ILD, irrespective of myositis subtype or presence of anti-aminoacyl-transfer RNA synthetase antibodies. The HLA-DRB1*07-DQA1*02-DQB1*02 haplotype was associated with risk for anti-Mi-2 antibodies, and discriminated PM from DM (odds ratio 0.3, 95% confidence interval 0.1-0.6), even in anti-Mi-2 negative patients. Other MSA/MAAs showed specific associations with other HLA class II haplotypes, irrespective of myositis subtype. There were no genotype, haplotype or serological associations with malignancy. The HLA-DRB1*03-DQA1*05-DQB1*02 haplotype associations appear to not only govern disease susceptibility in Caucasian PM/DM patients, but also phenotypic features common to PM/DM. Though strongly associated with anti-Mi-2 antibodies, the HLA-DRB1*07-DQA1*02-DQB1*02 haplotype shows differential associations with PM/DM disease susceptibility. In conclusion, these findings support the notion that myositis patients with differing myositis serology have different immunogenetic profiles, and that these profiles may define specific myositis subtypes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the SEPN1 gene encoding the selenoprotein N (SelN) have been described in different congenital myopathies. Here, we report the first mutation in the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) of SelN messenger RNA, a hairpin structure located in the 3' untranslated region, in a patient presenting a classical although mild form of rigid spine muscular dystrophy. We detected a significant reduction in both mRNA and protein levels in the patient's skin fibroblasts. The SECIS element is crucial for the insertion of selenocysteine at the reprogrammed UGA codon by recruiting the SECIS-binding protein 2 (SBP2), and we demonstrated that this mutation abolishes SBP2 binding to SECIS in vitro, thereby preventing co-translational incorporation of selenocysteine and SelN synthesis. The identification of this mutation affecting a conserved base in the SECIS functional motif thereby reveals the structural basis for a novel pathological mechanism leading to SEPN1-related myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Loss of specific muscle force and evidence of myopathy are present in the diaphragm of mdx mice by 4 weeks of age. The neuromuscular junction of dystrophic muscle also shows structural abnormalities at this age. Whether these structural alterations result in neural transmission abnormalities is currently unclear, particularly at physiological firing frequencies. Thus, we investigated the extent of neurotransmission variability and failure during 35 and 100 Hz stimulation in the diaphragm of 6 to 8-month-old mdx mice in comparison to age-matched controls. Neurotransmission failure was similar across groups at both stimulation frequencies, despite the presence of disrupted post-synaptic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Neural transmission variability, however, measured by comparing variation in force production during direct muscle stimulation compared to variation in force production during phrenic nerve stimulation was significantly greater in dystrophic muscle. Together, these results suggest that neurotransmission is maintained at physiologic firing frequencies in dystrophic muscle, but the precision of neurotransmission is attenuated. A reduced density of functional AChRs likely underlies the increase in neurotransmission variability.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in genes for sarcomeric proteins such as titin/connectin are known to cause dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, disease-causing mutations can be identified only in a small proportion of the patients even in the familial cases, suggesting that there remains yet unidentified disease-causing gene(s) for DCM. To explore the novel disease gene for DCM, we examined CRYAB encoding alphaB-crystallin for mutation in the patients with DCM, since alphaB-crystallin was recently reported to associate with the heart-specific N2B domain and adjacent I26/I27 domain of titin/connectin, and we previously reported a N2B mutation, Gln4053ter, in DCM. A missense mutation of CRYAB, Arg157His, was found in a familial DCM patient and the mutation affected the evolutionary conserved amino acid residue among alpha-crystallins. Functional analysis revealed that the mutation decreased the binding to titin/connectin heart-specific N2B domain without affecting distribution of the mutant crystallin protein in cardiomyocytes. In contrast, another CRYAB mutation, Arg120Gly, reported in desmin-related myopathy decreased the binding to both N2B and striated muscle-specific I26/27 domains and showed intracellular aggregates of the mutant protein. These observations suggest that the Arg157His mutation may be involved in the pathogenesis of DCM via impaired accommodation to the heart-specific N2B domain of titin/connectin and its disease-causing mechanism is different from the mutation found in desmin-related myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Both the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex and alpha7beta1 integrin have critical roles in the maintenance of muscle integrity via the provision of mechanical links between muscle fibres and the basement membrane. Absence of either dystrophin or alpha7 integrin results in a muscular dystrophy. To clarify the role of alpha7 integrin and dystrophin in muscle development and function, we generated integrin alpha7/dystrophin double-mutant knockout (DKO) mice. Surprisingly, DKO mice survived post-natally and were indistinguishable from wild-type, integrin alpha7-deficient and mdx mice at birth, but died within 24-28 days. Histological analysis revealed a severe muscular dystrophy in DKO mice with endomysial fibrosis and ectopic calcification. Weight loss was correlated with the loss of muscle fibres, indicating that progressive muscle wasting in the double mutant was most likely due to inadequate muscle regeneration. The data further support that premature death of DKO mice is due to cardiac and/or respiratory failure. The integrin alpha7/dystrophin-deficient mouse model, therefore, resembles the pathological changes seen in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and suggests that the different clinical severity of dystrophin deficiency in human and mouse may be due to a fine-tuned difference in expression of dystrophin and integrin alpha7 in both species. Together, these findings indicate an essential role for integrin alpha7 in the maintenance of dystrophin-deficient muscles.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A 71-year-old woman with a family history of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was investigated for symmetrical, proximal limb and abdominal muscle weakness. Initial examination showed mild proximal muscle weakness in the arms and legs, slightly elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) level, and normal electromyographic (EMG) findings. A myopathy was the presumed diagnosis. Over the next year, weakness became severe and tendon reflexes became unelicitable; no upper motor signs were present. EMG then showed acute and chronic denervation and a muscle biopsy showed target fibers and grouped atrophy. DNA analysis revealed a G72C CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mutation. Fasciculations were absent throughout the disease. The patient died 53 months after symptom onset and autopsy revealed loss of lower motor neurons (LMN) and SOD1-positive inclusions. This case expands the phenotypic spectrum of ALS associated with SOD1 mutations to include presenting features that mimic a myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline Myopathy with Intranuclear Rods is a rare variant of nemaline myopathy, due in almost all instances to mutation of ACTA1, the gene encoding skeletal muscle alpha-actin. We describe the novel autosomal dominant occurrence in a three-generation kindred, and review previously reported cases. Onset of myopathic symptoms in our kindred was in infancy or early childhood. Beyond infancy, limb muscle weakness was non-disabling and minimally progressive. A tall thin face and facial myopathy were prominent features in the affected adults. By light microscopy, muscle biopsies ranged from almost normal, to chronic myopathy with sarcoplasmic and intranuclear rods. A heterozygous GTG-ATG mutation (Val163Met) was found in exon 4 of ACTA1 in affected individuals. Actin is normally present within the nucleus in only trace amounts. Mutation at postion 163 may result in intranuclear rods by virtue of its close proximity to a nuclear export signal within the actin molecule.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations that alter muscle contraction lead to a large array of diseases, including muscular dystrophies and cardiomyopathies. Although the molecular lesions underlying many hereditary muscle diseases are known, the downstream pathways that contribute to disease pathogenesis and compensatory muscle remodeling are poorly defined. We have recently identified and characterized mutations in Myosin Heavy Chain (Mhc) that lead to hypercontraction and subsequent degeneration of flight muscles in Drosophila. To characterize the genomic response to hypercontraction-induced myopathy, we performed expression analysis using Affymetrix high density oligonucleotide microarrays in Drosophila Mhc hypercontraction alleles. The altered transcriptional profile of dystrophic Mhc muscles suggests an actin-dependent remodeling of the muscle cytoskeleton. Specifically, a subset of the highly up-regulated transcripts is involved in actin regulation and structural support for the contractile machinery. In addition, we identified previously uncharacterized proteins with putative actin-interaction domains that are up-regulated in Mhc mutants and differentially expressed in muscles. Several of the up-regulated proteins, including the dystrophin-related protein, MSP-300, and the homolog of the neuronal activity-regulated protein, ARC, localize to specific subcellular muscle structures that may provide key structural sites for cytoskeletal remodeling in dystrophic muscles. Defining the genome-wide transcriptional response to muscle hypercontraction in Drosophila has revealed candidate loci that may participate in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy and in compensatory muscle repair pathways through modulation of the actin cytoskeleton.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Both dominant and recessive mutations were reported in the gene encoding the mitochondrial (mt) DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) in patients with progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). Phenotypes other than PEO were recently documented in patients with mutations in the POLG gene. OBJECTIVE: To screen patients with mitochondrial disease and multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle for mutations in the coding regions of the POLG, PEO1, and SLC25A4 genes. DESIGN: To identify the underlying molecular defect in a group of patients with multiple mtDNA deletions comparing their molecular genetic findings with those of healthy controls. PATIENTS: Twenty-four patients (16 men and 8 women) diagnosed with mitochondrial disease and having multiple mtDNA deletions in muscle by Southern blot analysis. Thirteen patients had PEO; 2 had PEO alone, 4 had PEO and myopathy, and 5 had PEO and multisystem involvement. Four patients had multisystem disease without PEO. The remaining 9 patients had isolated myopathy. DNA from 100 healthy individuals was also studied. RESULTS: No mutation was identified in the PEO1 or SLC25A4 genes. Nine POLG mutations were observed in 6 of 24 patients. Four novel mutations were detected and mapped in the linker region (M603L) and in the pol domain of the enzyme (R853W; D1184N; R1146C). Five patients with PEO had mutations: 2 were compound heterozygotes, 1 was homozygous, and another showed a mutation in a single allele. The remaining patient also showed a sole mutation and had an unusual phenotype lacking ocular involvement. CONCLUSIONS: POLG molecular defects were found in 25% of our patients with multiple mtDNA deletions and mitochondrial disease. The uncommon phenotype found in 1 of these patients stresses the clinical variability of patients harboring POLG mutations. Molecular studies in the POLG gene should be addressed in patients with mitochondrial disease, particularly in those with PEO, and multiple mtDNA deletions.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Spheroid body myopathy (SBM) is a rare, autosomal dominant, neuromuscular disorder, which has only been previously reported in a single large kindred. Identification of the mutated gene in this disorder may provide insight regarding abnormal neuromuscular function. METHODS: The authors completed a detailed clinical evaluation on an extensive kindred diagnosed with SBM. Genome-wide linkage analysis was performed to localize the disease gene to a specific chromosomal region. Further marker genotyping and screening of a positional, functional candidate gene were completed to detect the disease-causing mutation. Pathologic analysis of muscle biopsy was performed on three individuals. Biochemical studies were performed on one muscle biopsy specimen from an affected individual. RESULTS: Linkage to chromosome 5q23-5q31 was detected with a lod score of 2.9. Genotyping of additional markers in a larger sample of family members produced a maximum lod score of 6.1 and narrowed the critical interval to 12.2 cM. Screening of the candidate gene titin immunoglobulin domain protein (TTID, also known as MYOT) detected a cytosine-to-thymine mutation in exon 2 of all clinically affected family members. Similar pathologic changes were present in all muscle biopsy specimens. Immunohistologic and biochemical analysis revealed that the TTID protein, also known as myotilin, is a component of the insoluble protein aggregate. CONCLUSIONS: A novel mutation in the TTID gene results in the clinical and pathologic phenotype termed "spheroid body myopathy." Mutations in this gene also cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 1A and are associated with myofibrillar myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Minicore myopathy (multi-minicore disease [MmD]) is a congenital myopathy characterized by multifocal areas with loss of oxidative activity on muscle biopsy. MmD is clinically heterogeneous and distinct phenotypes have been associated with recessive mutations in either the selenoprotein N (SEPN1) or the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene, also implicated in central core disease and malignant hyperthermia. External ophthalmoplegia is an additional finding in a subset of patients with MmD. OBJECTIVE: To clinically and genetically examine families with MmD and external ophthalmoplegia. METHODS: The authors investigated 11 affected individuals from 5 unrelated families. Clinical, histopathologic, and imaging studies were performed and RYR1 haplotyping and mutational analysis were carried out. RESULTS: All patients had multiple cores involving the entire fiber diameter on longitudinal sections. Weakness and wasting in the shoulder girdle, scoliosis, moderate respiratory impairment, and feeding difficulties were prominent. In contrast to SEPN1-related myopathies, soleus was more severely affected than gastrocnemius on muscle MRI. Haplotyping suggested linkage to the RYR1 locus in informative families and mutational screening revealed four novel RYR1 mutations in three unrelated families; in addition, functional haploinsufficiency was found in one allele of two recessive cases. CONCLUSION: These findings expand the phenotypic spectrum associated with mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene. Recessive mutations of domains commonly affected in malignant hyperthermia appear to be particularly prevalent in multi-minicore disease with external ophthalmoplegia and might suggest a different pathomechanism from that involved in central core disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Protein misfolding and aberrant aggregation are associated with many severe disorders, such as neural degenerative diseases, desmin-related myopathy (DRM), and congestive heart failure. Intrasarcoplasmic amyloidosis and increased ubiquitinated proteins are observed in human failing hearts. The pathogenic roles of these derangements in the heart remain unknown. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) plays a central role in intracellular proteolysis and regulates critical cellular processes. In cultured cells, aberrant aggregation by a mutant (MT) or misfolded protein impairs the UPS. However, this has not been demonstrated in intact animals, and it is unclear how the UPS is impaired. Cross-breeding UPS reporter mice with a transgenic mouse model of DRM featured by aberrant protein aggregation in cardiomyocytes, we found that overexpression of MT-desmin but not normal desmin protein impairs UPS proteolytic function in the heart. The primary defect does not appear to be in the ubiquitination or the proteolytic activity of the 20S proteasome, because ubiquitinated proteins and the peptidase activities of 20S proteasomes were significantly increased rather than decreased in the DRM heart. Therefore, the defect resides apparently in the entry of ubiquitinated proteins into the 20S proteasome. Consistent with this notion, key components (Rpt3 and Rpt5) of 19S proteasomes were markedly decreased, while major components of 20S proteasomes were increased. Additional experiments with HEK cells suggest that proteasomal malfunction observed in MT-desmin hearts is not secondary to cardiac malfunction or to disruption of desmin filaments. Thus, UPS impairment may represent an important pathogenic mechanism underlying cardiac disorders with abnormal protein aggregation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Our first objective was to determine whether SEPN1 gene mutations are a cause of congenital fiber-type disproportion (CFTD), a rare form of congenital myopathy in which relative hypotrophy of type 1 (slow twitch) muscle fibers is the principal abnormality on histology. Second, we investigated an association between SEPN1-related myopathy and insulin resistance. METHODS: We sequenced SEPN1 in five unrelated CFTD patients with scoliosis and respiratory muscle weakness and screened an additional 22 CFTD patients for abnormalities in SEPN1 by Western blotting and restriction digest for the 943G-->A mutation. We performed oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) in eight SEPN1-related myopathy patients. RESULTS: Two sisters with CFTD were homozygous for the 943G-->A SEPN1 mutation and had clinical features typical of previously reported patients with SEPN1-related myopathy. Five of eight SEPN1-related myopathy patients had abnormalities on OGTT suggestive of insulin resistance. INTERPRETATION: SEPN1 is the second genetic cause of CFTD and the first cause of autosomal recessive CFTD to be identified to our knowledge. CFTD is the fourth clinicopathological presentation that can be associated with mutations in SEPN1. Insulin resistance may be a specific, previously unrecognized aspect of SEPN1-related myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I is caused by mutations in the fukutin-related protein gene (FKRP). FKRP encodes a putative glycosyltransferase protein that is involved in alpha-dystroglycan glycosylation. OBJECTIVES: To identify patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I and to derive genotype-phenotype correlations. DESIGN: Two hundred fourteen patients who showed muscle histopathologic features consistent with muscular dystrophy or myopathy of unknown etiology were studied. The entire 1.5-kilobase FKRP coding sequence from patient DNA was analyzed using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography of overlapping polymerase chain reaction products, followed by direct sequencing of heteroduplexes. RESULTS: Thirteen patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2I (6% of all patients tested) were identified by FKRP mutation analysis, and 7 additional patients were identified by family screening. Six missense mutations (1 novel) were identified. The 826C>A nucleotide change was a common mutation, present in 35% of the mutated chromosomes. Clinical presentations included asymptomatic hyperCKemia, severe early-onset muscular dystrophy, and mild late-onset muscular dystrophy. Dilated cardiomyopathy and ventilatory impairment were frequent features. Significant intrafamilial and interfamilial clinical variability was observed. CONCLUSIONS: FKRP mutations are a frequent cause of limb-girdle muscular dystrophies. The degree of respiratory and cardiac insufficiency in patients did not correlate with the severity of muscle involvement. The finding of 2 asymptomatic patients with FKRP mutations suggests that modulating factors may ameliorate the clinical phenotype.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the AAA+ protein (ATPase associated with a variety of cellular activities) p97/VCP (valosin-containing protein) cause a dominantly inherited syndrome of inclusion body myopathy with Paget's disease of the bone and fronto-temporal dementia (IBMPFD). p97/VCP is a ubiquitously expressed protein that participates in a number of cellular processes including endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). p97/VCP aids in the extraction of ubiquitinated proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and facilitates their delivery to the proteasome. This study focuses on the effects of disease-associated p97/VCP mutations on this pathway. We show that p97/VCP containing the most prevalent IBMPFD-associated mutation, R155H, has normal ATPase activity and hexameric structure. However, when expressed in cultured cells, both this and a second IBMPFD-associated p97/VCP mutant increase the overall level of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins and specifically impair degradation of mutant DeltaF508-CFTR handled by the ERAD pathway. These effects are similar to those previously described for an ATPase deficient p97/VCP mutant and suggest that IBMPFD mutations impair p97/VCP cellular function. In a subset of cells, IBMPFD mutations also promote formation of aggregates that contain p97/VCP, ubiquitin conjugates and ER-resident proteins. Undegraded mutant DeltaF508-CFTR also accumulates in these aggregates. We conclude that IBMPFD mutations in p97/VCP disrupt ERAD and that this may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBMPFD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>PURPOSE: The adenine nucleotide transporter 1 gene (ANT1) encodes an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that transports ATP into the cell. Mutations within ANT1 produce a syndrome of chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) in humans. Ant1 knockout (Ant1-/-) mice develop cardiomyopathy and mitochondrial myopathy of limb muscles. Because the extraocular muscles (EOM) are preferentially affected in human CPEO, the objective of this study was to determine whether Ant1-/-mice also exhibit an EOM mitochondrial myopathy. METHODS: ANT isoform expression of isolated EOMs, EOM morphology and mitochondrial content, mitochondrial structure and function, ocular motility in intact mice, and contractile performance in isolated muscle preparations were examined. RESULTS: Ant1-/-EOMs had the typical appearance of mitochondrial myopathy, including increase in mitochondrial size, number, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) staining. However, there were no measurable ocular motor abnormalities in intact Ant1-/-mice, and their isolated EOMs did not show evidence of increased fatigability. EOMs of wild-type mice exhibited higher levels of Ant2 mRNA compared with hindlimb muscle, which may compensate for the Ant1 loss in mutant mouse EOMs and account for the normal EOM function. CONCLUSIONS: The Ant1-/-mice provide a model in which to study CPEO pathology and compensatory mechanisms.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Cytoplasmic overexpression of Akt in the heart results in a myopathy characterized by organ and myocyte hypertrophy. Conversely, nuclear-targeted Akt does not lead to cardiac hypertrophy, but the cellular basis of this distinct heart phenotype remains to be determined. Similarly, whether nuclear-targeted Akt affects ventricular performance and mechanics, calcium metabolism, and electrical properties of myocytes is unknown. Moreover, whether the expression and state of phosphorylation of regulatory proteins implicated in calcium cycling and myocyte contractility are altered in nuclear-targeted Akt has not been established. We report that nuclear overexpression of Akt does not modify cardiac size and shape but results in an increased number of cardiomyocytes, which are smaller in volume. Additionally, the heart possesses enhanced systolic and diastolic function, which is paralleled by increased myocyte performance. Myocyte shortening and velocity of shortening and relengthening are increased in transgenic mice and are coupled with a more efficient reuptake of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This process increases calcium loading of the SR during relengthening. The enhanced SR function appears to be mediated by an increase in SR Ca2+-ATPase2a activity sustained by a higher degree of phosphorylation of phospholamban. This posttranslational modification was associated with an increase in phospho-protein kinase A and a decrease in protein phosphatase-1. Together, these observations provide a plausible biochemical mechanism for the potentiation of myocyte and ventricular function in Akt transgenic mice. Therefore, nuclear-targeted Akt in myocytes may have important implications for the diseased heart.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA) have been associated with neuromuscular diseases and more complex syndromes, involving bone and adipose tissue. We report on a case of early onset myopathy due to a heterozygous LMNA mutation in exon 9, characterized by the presence of a marked number of cytoplasmic bodies with extensive myofibrillar abnormalities and Z-disk disruption in skeletal muscle. This case suggests there is a need to increase the list of genes to be screened in patients with myofibrillar myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We identified the gene underlying Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome, which is characterized by cerebellar ataxia, progressive myopathy and cataracts. We identified four disease-associated, predicted loss-of-function mutations in SIL1, which encodes a nucleotide exchange factor for the heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) chaperone HSPA5. These data, together with the similar spatial and temporal patterns of tissue expression of Sil1 and Hspa5, suggest that disturbed SIL1-HSPA5 interaction and protein folding is the primary pathology in Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>SIL1 (also called BAP) acts as a nucleotide exchange factor for the Hsp70 chaperone BiP (also called GRP78), which is a key regulator of the main functions of the endoplasmic reticulum. We found nine distinct mutations that would disrupt the SIL1 protein in individuals with Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome, an autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia complicated by cataracts, developmental delay and myopathy. Identification of SIL1 mutations implicates Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome as a disease of endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction and suggests a role for this organelle in multisystem disorders.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Idiopathic inflammatory myopathy is a chronic inflammatory muscle disease characterized by mononuclear cell infiltration in the skeletal muscle. The infiltrated inflammatory cells express various cytokines and cytotoxic molecules. Chemokines are thought to contribute to the inflammatory cell migration into the muscle. We induced experimental autoimmune myositis (EAM) in SJL/J mice by immunization with rabbit myosin and CFA. In the affected muscles of EAM mice, CX3CL1 (fractalkine) was expressed on the infiltrated mononuclear cells and endothelial cells, and its corresponding receptor, CX3CR1, was expressed on the infiltrated CD4 and CD8 T cells and macrophages. Treatment of EAM mice with anti-CX3CL1 mAb significantly reduced the histopathological myositis score, the number of necrotic muscle fibers, and infiltration of CD4 and CD8 T cells and macrophages. Furthermore, treatment with anti-CX3CL1 mAb down-regulated the mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and perforin in the muscles. Our results suggest that CX3CL1-CX3CR1 interaction plays an important role in inflammatory cell migration into the muscle tissue of EAM mice. The results also point to the potential therapeutic usefulness of CX3CL1 inhibition and/or blockade of CX3CL1-CX3CR1 interaction in idiopathic inflammatory myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Normal motility of the zebrafish embryo requires a large number of gene loci, many of which have human orthologues implicated in myasthenias and other myopathies. We have identified a mutation in the zebrafish that abolishes body motility. Embryos have narrower myofibrils and lack clusters of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on the surface of the somitic muscle. We mapped the mutation to the delta-subunit of the nAChR, showing this mutant to be a new allele of the previously named sofa potato (sop). The mutant allele carries a missense mutation in the extracellular domain altering the cysteine at position 150 to an arginine. The delta-subunit is expressed in all striated muscles in embryonic and early larval stages together with the alpha1, beta1, epsilon, and gamma-subunits of nAChR. In contrast to mammals that show switching from the gamma embryonic to the adult epsilon-subunit, the two subunits are coexpressed in zebrafish embryos. We, furthermore, demonstrated that the sop/delta-nAChR mutation is a suppressor of the myopathy caused by lack of Dystrophin. The myofiber detachment phenotype of Dystroglycan-deficient embryos was not suppressed, suggesting that Dystrophin and Dystroglycan play distinct roles in muscle formation and maintenance of muscle integrity.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Trim32 belongs to the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, which is characterized by a common domain structure composed of a RING-finger, a B-box, and a coiled-coil motif. In addition to these motifs, Trim32 possesses six C-terminal NHL-domains. A point mutation in one NHL domain (D487N) has been linked to two forms of muscular dystrophy called limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H and sarcotubular myopathy. In the present study we demonstrate that Trim32 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that acts in conjunction with ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UbcH5a, UbcH5c, and UbcH6. Western blot analysis showed that Trim32 is expressed primarily in skeletal muscle, and revealed its differential expression from one muscle to another. The level of Trim32 expression was elevated significantly in muscle undergoing remodeling due to changes in weight bearing. Furthermore, expression of Trim32 was induced in myogenic differentiation. Thus, variability in Trim32 expression in different skeletal muscles could be due to induction of Trim32 expression upon changes in physiological conditions. We show that Trim32 associates with skeletal muscle thick filaments, interacting directly with the head and neck region of myosin. Our data indicate that myosin is not a substrate of Trim32; however, Trim32 was found to ubiquitinate actin in vitro and to cause a decrease in the level of endogenous actin when transfected into HEK293 cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that Trim32 is a ubiquitin ligase that is expressed in skeletal muscle, can be induced upon muscle unloading and reloading, associates with myofibrils and is able to ubiquitinate actin, suggesting its likely participation in myofibrillar protein turnover, especially during muscle adaptation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The mechanism of fibrate-induced myopathy was investigated in this report. When clofibrate (30 to 300 microM) was applied to L6 rat skeletal myoblasts, dose-dependently apoptosis was observed within 24 h. In the apoptotic myoblasts, a caspase-12 cleavage was observed at 2 h and with following caspases-9 and -3-related cascade activation. In contrast, the neutral protease calpain, that is a key enzyme in ER stress-related apoptosis via caspase-12 activation, was significantly decreased during apoptosis. Next, the authors evaluated a role of calcium-dependent signal(s). When clofibrate was added into medium, cytosolic calcium concentration was rapidly and persistently increased. On the other hand, an addition of 10 mM EGTA depressed sustained calcium phase, and concurrent myoblasts apoptosis was completely inhibited. Taken together, our findings indicate that the clofibrate-induced myopathy is triggered by Ca2+ influx, then activated cytosolic caspase-12 through calpain-independent cascade, and consequently caused apoptotic DNA fragmentation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In Europe, 2 closely related alphaviruses (Togaviridae) are regarded as the causative agents of sleeping disease (SD) and salmon pancreas disease (SPD): SD virus (SDV) has been isolated from rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in France and the UK, while SPD virus (SPDV) has been isolated from salmon Salmo salar in Ireland and the UK. Farmed salmonids in western Norway also suffer from a disease called pancreas disease (PD), and this disease is also believed to be caused by an alphavirus. However, this virus has not yet been characterised at the molecular level. We have cultured a Norwegian salmonid alphavirus from moribund fishes diagnosed with cardiac myopathy syndrome (CMS) and fishes diagnosed with PD. The virus has also been found in salmon suffering from haemorrhagic smolt syndrome in the fresh water phase. The genomic organisation of the Norwegian salmonid alphavirus is identical to that in SPDV and SDV, and the nucleotide sequence similarity to the other 2 alphaviruses is 91.6 and 92.9%, respectively. Based on the pathological changes, host species and the nucleotide sequence, we suggest naming this virus Norwegian salmonid alphavirus (NSAV). Together with SPDV and SDV it constitutes a third subtype of salmonid alphavirus (SAV) species within the genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Autosomal dominant centronuclear myopathy is a rare congenital myopathy characterized by delayed motor milestones and muscular weakness. In 11 families affected by centronuclear myopathy, we identified recurrent and de novo missense mutations in the gene dynamin 2 (DNM2, 19p13.2), which encodes a protein involved in endocytosis and membrane trafficking, actin assembly and centrosome cohesion. The transfected mutants showed reduced labeling in the centrosome, suggesting that DNM2 mutations might cause centronuclear myopathy by interfering with centrosome function.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Danon disease, an X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy caused by primary deficiency of lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2), is clinically characterized by cardiomyopathy, myopathy, and variable mental retardation. The pathological hallmark of the disease is the absence of LAMP-2 immunohistochemical staining in muscle. The LAMP-2 gene mutations reported thus far are generally private mutations. We describe two cases of Danon disease with different clinical presentation, in whom we identified the same exon skipping mutation c.928G>A in the LAMP-2 gene. The first patient was affected by an early onset myopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) that partially improved with drug treatment. A first muscle biopsy at age 4 months showed markedly increased glycogen, and acid maltase deficiency was ruled out biochemically. A second muscle biopsy, performed at age 3(1/2) years, showed very mild abnormalities. The second child at age 15 years had mild, diffuse muscle weakness and wasting, moderate mental deficiency, and HCM. Two serial biopsies performed at age 8 and 15 years showed similar findings of multiple esterase-positive vacuoles in type I myofibers. In both patients the immunohistochemical study demonstrated the absence of LAMP-2 in skeletal muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The two small heat shock proteins (sHSPs), alphaB-crystallin and HSPB2, have been shown to translocate within a few minutes of cardiac ischemia from the cytosol to myofibrils; and it has been suggested that their chaperone-like properties might protect myofibrillar proteins from unfolding or aggregation during stress conditions. Further evidence of an important role for HSPs in muscle function is provided by the fact that mutations of the alphaB-crystallin gene cause myopathy and cardiomyopathy. In the present study, we subjected isolated papillary muscles of alphaB-crystallin/HSPB2-deficient mice to simulated ischemia and reperfusion. During ischemia in alphaB-crystallin/HSPB2-deficient muscles, the development of contracture started earlier and reached a higher value compared to the wildtype mice. The recovery of contracture of alphaB-crystallin/HSPB2-deficient muscles was also attenuated during the simulated reperfusion period. However, twitch force was not significantly altered at any time of the experiment. This suggests that during ischemic insults, alphaB-crystallin/HSPB2 may not be important for the contraction process itself, but rather serve to maintain muscular elasticity.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The presence of increased ubiquitinated proteins and amyloid oligomers in failing human hearts strikingly resembles the characteristic pathology in the brain of many neurodegenerative diseases. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is responsible for degradation of most cellular proteins and plays essential roles in virtually all cellular processes. UPS impairment by aberrant protein aggregation was previously shown in cell culture but remains to be demonstrated in intact animals. Mechanisms underlying the impairment are poorly understood. We report here that UPS proteolytic function is severely impaired in the heart of a mouse model of intrasarcoplasmic amyloidosis caused by cardiac-restricted expression of a human desmin-related myopathy-linked missense mutation of alphaB-crystallin (CryAB(R120G)). The UPS impairment was detected before cardiac hypertrophy, and failure became discernible, suggesting that defective protein turnover likely contributes to cardiac remodeling and failure in this model. Further analyses reveal that the impairment is likely attributable to insufficient delivery of substrate proteins into the 20S proteasomes, and depletion of key components of the 19S subcomplex may be responsible. The derangement is likely caused by aberrant protein aggregation rather than loss of function of the CryAB gene because UPS malfunction was not evident in CryAB-null hearts and inhibition of aberrant protein aggregation by Congo red or a heat shock protein significantly attenuated CryAB(R120G)-induced UPS malfunction in cultured cardiomyocytes. Because of the central role of the UPS in cell regulation and the high intrasarcoplasmic amyloidosis prevalence in failing human hearts, our data suggest a novel pathogenic process in cardiac disorders with abnormal protein aggregation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report a patient with a slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome who carries a novel slow-channel mutation in the epsilon subunit of the acetylcholine receptor and has tubulofilamentous inclusion bodies, in skeletal muscle of the type observed in hereditary and sporadic inclusion body myositis. Ultrastructural analysis of a muscle specimen obtained at the age of 9 years showed an endplate myopathy typical of the slow-channel syndrome. Twenty years later, a second muscle specimen again showed the endplate myopathy as well numerous nuclear and cytoplasmic tubulofilamentous inclusion bodies. Molecular genetic studies revealed a novel valine to phenylalanine mutation (epsilonV259F) in the M2 domain of the acetylcholine receptor. Coexistence of the slow-channel syndrome with a feature of IBM has not been observed before.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) is a subclinical pharmacogenetic disorder caused by an impairment of skeletal muscle calcium homeostasis in response to triggering agents. While in vitro contracture testing (IVCT) is the gold standard for defining MHS, molecular analysis is increasingly used to diagnosis MHS. Mutations associated with MHS have been reported in two genes: RYR1 and CACNA1S. Mutations in RYR1 are also responsible for central core disease (CCD), a myopathy that can be associated with a positive IVCT response. We report here the results of correlation studies performed with molecular, pharmacological, histological, and functional data obtained in 175 families (referred to as confirmed (129) or potential (46) MHS families). Extensive molecular analysis allowed us to identify a variant in 60% of the confirmed MHS families, and resulted in the characterization of 11 new variants in the RYR1 gene. Most mutations clustered to MH1 and MH2 domains of RYR1. Functional analysis allowed us to assign a causative role for seven MHS mutations that we propose to add to the panel of MHS mutations used for genetic testing. The use of genetic data to determine MHS status led to a 99.5% sensitivity for IVCT. IVCT-positive/mutation-negative diagnoses were analyzed not only in terms of specificity for IVCT, but also to assess the presence of a second MHS trait in families, and the genetic heterogeneity of the disease. Histological analyses revealed the presence of cores in more than 20% of muscle biopsies originating from 242 genotyped and tested MHS patients who did not present with clinical symptoms. This indicates that these patients must be considered as MHS patients with cores, and are clearly differentiated from CCD patients who have been tested positive for MHS.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions are associated with clinically heterogeneous disorders transmitted as mendelian traits. Dominant missense mutations were found in the gene encoding the heart and skeletal muscle-specific isoform of the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT1) in families with autosomal dominant progressive external opthalmoplegia and in a sporadic patient. We herein report on a sporadic patient who presented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mild myopathy with exercise intolerance and lactic acidosis but no ophthalmoplegia. A muscle biopsy showed the presence of numerous ragged-red fibers, and Southern blot analysis disclosed multiple deletions of muscle mitochondrial DNA. Molecular analysis revealed a C to A homozygous mutation at nucleotide 368 of the ANT1 gene. The mutation converted a highly conserved alanine into an aspartic acid at codon 123 and was absent in 500 control individuals. This is the first report of a recessive mutation in the ANT1 gene. The clinical and biochemical features are different from those found in dominant ANT1 mutations, resembling those described in ANT1 knockout mice. No ATP uptake was measured in proteoliposomes reconstituted with protein extracts from the patient's muscle. The equivalent mutation in AAC2, the yeast ortholog of human ANT1, resulted in a complete loss of transport activity and in the inability to rescue the severe Oxidative Phosphorylation phenotype displayed by WB-12, an AAC1/AAC2 defective strain. Interestingly, exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers dramatically increased the viability of the WB-12 transformant, suggesting that increased redox stress is involved in the pathogenesis of the disease and that anti-ROS therapy may be beneficial to patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Some patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) or left ventricular hypertrophy also present with skeletal myopathy and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome; mutations in the gene encoding the lysosome-associated protein-2 (LAMP-2) have been identified in these patients, suggesting that some of these patients have Danon disease. In this study we investigated the frequency of LAMP2 mutations in an unselected pediatric HCM population. METHODS AND RESULTS: LAMP2 was amplified from genomic DNA isolated from peripheral lymphocytes of 50 patients diagnosed with HCM and analyzed by direct DNA sequencing. In 2 of the 50 probands (4%), nonsense mutations were identified. In 1 family the proband initially presented with HCM as a teenager, which progressed to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and heart failure. Skeletal myopathy and WPW were also noted. The teenage sister of the proband is a carrier of the same LAMP2 mutation and has HCM without skeletal myopathy or WPW. The other proband presented with HCM, WPW, and skeletal myopathy as a teenager, whereas his carrier mother developed DCM during her 40s. Skeletal and cardiac muscle sections revealed the absence of LAMP-2 on immunohistochemical staining. CONCLUSIONS: LAMP2 mutations may account for a significant proportion of cases of HCM in children, especially when skeletal myopathy and/or WPW is present, suggesting that Danon disease is an underrecognized entity in the pediatric cardiology community.</rdfs:comment>

Here, we performed a microarray analysis using Mef2c-null mouse embryos and identified a novel MEF2-regulated gene encoding a muscle-specific protein kinase, Srpk3, belonging to the serine arginine protein kinase (SRPK) family, which phosphorylates serine/arginine repeat-containing proteins. The Srpk3 gene is specifically expressed in the heart and skeletal muscle from embryogenesis to adulthood and is controlled by a muscle-specific enhancer directly regulated by MEF2. Srpk3-null mice display a new entity of type 2 fiber-specific myopathy with a marked increase in centrally placed nuclei; while transgenic mice overexpressing Srpk3 in skeletal muscle show severe myofiber degeneration and early lethality. We conclude that normal muscle growth and homeostasis require MEF2-dependent signaling by Srpk3.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations of mitochondrial tRNA genes are usually associated with multi-systemic disorders with onset of symptoms in childhood or early adulthood. Dystrophic myopathic changes are not typical features of these disorders. We report two siblings with a severe progressive myopathy of late onset without external ophthalmoplegia and without involvement of the central and peripheral nervous system. Muscle biopsy specimens showed severe myopathic changes similar to those found in muscular dystrophies. Molecular analysis revealed a G7497A mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA(Ser(UCN)) gene. In both patients, the proportion of mutated mitochondrial DNA in muscle was more than 97%. Mitochondrial disorder associated with the G7497A mutation has to be included into the differential diagnosis of severe progressive late-onset myopathy with histopathological dystrophic myopathic changes. Mitochondrial myopathy and high level of mutated mtDNA might be a characteristic of the G7497A tRNA(Ser(UCN)) mutation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotilin is a sarcomeric Z-disc protein that binds F-actin directly and bundles actin filaments, although it does not contain a conventional actin-binding domain. Expression of mutant myotilin leads to sarcomeric alterations in the dominantly inherited limb-girdle muscular dystrophy 1A and in myofibrillar myopathy/desmin-related myopathy. Together, with previous in vitro studies, this indicates that myotilin has an important function in the assembly and maintenance of Z-discs. This study characterises further the interaction between myotilin and actin. Functionally important regions in myotilin were identified by actin pull-down and yeast two-hybrid assays and with a novel strategy that combines in vitro DNA transposition-based peptide insertion mutagenesis with phenotype analysis in yeast cells. The shortest fragment to bind actin was the second Ig domain together with a short C-terminal sequence. Concerted action of the first and second Ig domain was, however, necessary for the functional activity of myotilin, as verified by analysis of transposon mutants, actin binding and phenotypic effect in mammalian cells. Furthermore, the Ig domains flanked with N- and C-terminal regions were needed for actin-bundling, indicating that the mere actin-binding sequence was insufficient for the actin-regulating activity. None of the four known disease-associated mutations altered the actin-organising ability. These results, together with previous studies in titin and kettin, identify the Ig domain as an actin-binding unit.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: A genome-wide scan of gene expression in leucocytes in Asian Indians with type 2 diabetes was performed and correlated with their known phenotype. METHODS: Microarray gene profiling of 13,474 sequence-verified, non-redundant human cDNAs was done to study leukocyte gene expression in Asian Indians with type 2 diabetes (DM: n=3) and matched controls (n=3). RESULTS: Significant differential expression (fold change &lt;0.3 or >3) was noted for 897 genes in DM vs. controls. The 147 known genes in this category belonged to following broad functional groups (%): enzyme (32), nucleic acid binding (22), ligand binding or carrier (10), signal transducer (9), transporter (7), structural protein (6), cell adhesion (3), tumor suppressor (3), transcription factor binding (2), enzyme inhibitor (2), chaperone (2), cell cycle regulator (1), and defense/immunity protein (1). The 20 genes with at least a 3-fold change, annotated with known phenotypic associations in the current gene databank (phenotype association, fold change) were aspartoacylase (Canavan disease, 9.96), growth hormone receptor (Laron dwarfism, idiopathic short stature, 8.25), lipoprotein lipase (familial chylomicronemia syndrome, lipoprotein lipase deficiency, 8.00), vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) receptor (involutional osteoporosis, vitamin D resistant rickets, 7.94), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 human rhinovirus receptor (cerebral malaria susceptibility, 7.16), peroxisomal membrane protein 3 35-kDa (Refsum disease, infantile form, Zellweger syndrome-3, 6.00), Bardet-Biedl syndrome 2 (Bardet-Biedl syndrome, 5.87), ribosomal protein S19 (Diamond Blackfan anemia, 5.85), apolipoprotein C-III (hypertriglyceridemia, 5.44), argininosuccinate lyase (argininosuccinicaciduria, 5.22), myosin VA (Griscelli syndrome-type pigmentary dilution with mental retardation, 4.92), lysozyme (renal amyloidosis, 4.17), SAM domain, SH3 domain and nuclear localisation signals 1 (Cherubism, 4.12 ), von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (hemangioblastoma, cerebellar, somatic, von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, 3.94), early-onset breast cancer 1 (BRCA1, papillary serous carcinoma of the peritoneum, 3.73), UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (inclusion body myopathy, autosomal recessive, sialuria, 3.53), apolipoprotein A-I (amyloidosis, 3 or more types, hypoalphalipoproteinemia, 3.29), midline 1 Opitz/BBB syndrome (Opitz G syndrome, type I, 3.28), ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting, alpha 2 (+) polypeptide (familial hemiplegic migraine, 3.05). Canavan disease, Zellweger syndrome, infantile Refsum disease, Griscelli syndrome, cherubism, breast cancer, peritoneal papillary serous carcinoma, Opitz G/BBB syndrome, and familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) are phenotypes not previously reported in association with type 2 DM, but whose underlying genes were up-regulated in this peripheral genome scan of Asian Indians. CONCLUSION: Rare and/or previously unknown phenotypes linked to known genes with significant differential expression in type 2 DM are reported. Further testing of heterogeneity in diabetes phenotype syndromes may reveal common pathogenic mechanisms and potential candidate genes responsible for type 2 DM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We have created a mouse model with an isolated cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency by disrupting the COX10 gene in skeletal muscle. Missense mutations in COX10 have been previously associated with mitochondrial disorders. Cox10p is a protoheme:heme-O-farnesyl transferase required for the synthesis of heme a, the prosthetic group of the catalytic center of COX. COX10 conditional knockout mice were generated by crossing a LoxP-tagged COX10 mouse with a transgenic mouse expressing cre recombinase under the myosin light chain 1f promoter. The COX10 knockout mice were healthy until approximately 3 months of age when they started developing a slowly progressive myopathy. Surprisingly, even though COX activity in COX10 KO muscles was &lt;5% of control muscle at 2.5 months, these muscles were still able to contract at 80-100% of control maximal forces and showed only a 10% increase in fatigability, and no signs of oxidative damage or apoptosis were detected. However, the myopathy worsened with time, particularly in female animals. This COX10 KO mouse allowed us to correlate the muscle function with residual COX activity, an estimate that can help predict the progression pattern of human mitochondrial myopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the DYSF gene underlie two main muscle diseases: Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD) 2B and Miyoshi myopathy (MM). Dysferlin is involved in muscle membrane-repair and is thought to interact with other dysferlin molecules and annexins A1 and A2 at the sarcolemma. We performed genotype/phenotype correlations in a large cohort of dysferlinopathic patients and explored the possible role of annexins as modifier factors in LGMD-2B and MM. In particular, clinical examination, expression of sarcolemmal proteins and genetic analysis were performed on 27 dysferlinopathic subjects. Expression of A1 and A2 annexins was investigated in LGMD-2B/MM subjects and in patients with other muscle disorders. We identified 24 different DYSF mutations, 10 of them being novel. We observed no clear correlation between mutation type and clinical phenotype, but MM patients were found to display muscle symptoms significantly earlier in life than LGMD subjects. Remarkably, dysferlinopathic patients and subjects suffering from other muscular disorders expressed higher levels of both annexins compared to controls; a significant correlation was observed between annexin expression levels and clinical severity scores. Also, annexin amounts paralleled the degree of muscle histopathologic changes. In conclusion, our data indicate that the pathogenesis of different inherited and acquired muscle disorders involves annexin overexpression, probably because these proteins actively participate in the plasmalemma repair process. The positive correlation between annexin A1 and A2 and clinical severity, as well as muscle histopathology, suggests that their level may be a prognostic indicator of disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Mutations in the dysferlin (DYSF) gene cause 3 different phenotypes of muscular dystrophies: Miyoshi myopathy, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B, and distal anterior compartment myopathy. OBJECTIVE: To present the results of clinical and molecular analysis of 8 patients with dysferlinopathy from 5 unrelated families. DESIGN: Clinical assessment was performed with a standardized protocol. A muscle biopsy specimen was obtained and studied by immunohistochemistry. Genetic analysis was performed using single-stranded conformation polymorphism and direct sequencing of genomic DNA. RESULTS: All the patients presented the R1905X mutation in the DYSF gene in homozygosity, and the haplotype analysis at the DYSF locus revealed that it was a novel and founder mutation. A C-to-T transition at nucleotide position 6086 changes an arginine into a stop codon, leading to premature termination of translation. This mutation was expressed as 3 different clinical phenotypes (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B, Miyoshi distal myopathy, and distal anterior dysferlinopathy), but only 1 phenotype was found in the same family. CONCLUSIONS: The new R1905X DYSF founder mutation produced the 3 possible dysferlinopathy phenotypes without intrafamilial heterogeneity. This homogeneous population in Sueca, Spain, should be helpful in studying the modifying factors responsible for the phenotypic variability.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotilin and the calsarcin family member FATZ-1 (also called calsarcin-2 or myozenin-1) are recently discovered sarcomeric proteins implicated in the assembly and stabilization of the Z-discs in skeletal muscle. The essential role of myotilin in skeletal muscle is attested by the observation that certain forms of myofibrillar myopathy and limb girdle muscular dystrophy are caused by mutations in the human myotilin gene. Here we show by transfection, biochemical and/or yeast two-hybrid assay that: (1) myotilin is able to interact with the C-terminal region of FATZ-1 and that the N- or C-terminal truncations of myotilin abrogate binding; (2) myotilin can also interact with another calsarcin member, FATZ-2 (calsarcin-1, myozenin-2); (3) myotilin and FATZ-1 bind not only to the C-terminal region of filamin-C containing the Ig repeats 19-24, but also to the other two filamins, filamin-A and filamin-B, as well as the newly identified filamin-Bvar-1variant; (4) the binding of myotilin to filamin-C involves binding sites in its N-terminal region, whereas FATZ-1 associates with filamin-C via sequences within either its N- or C-terminal region; and finally, (5) the C-terminal region of filamin-C like filamin-B and filamin-Bvar-1, shows binding activity with the beta1A integrin subunit. Our findings further dissect the molecular interactions within the Z-disc that are essential for its organization, and provide evidence for a novel connection between Z-disc proteins and the sarcolemma via filamins and beta1 integrins. These data shed new light on the complex organization of the Z-disc that is highly relevant to understanding muscular dystrophies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The tibialis anterior muscles of mdx mice degenerate between 3 and 4 weeks after birth and then partially recover. We show that the membrane cytoskeleton at the mdx sarcolemma is disorganized at 18-days postnatal, and becomes more disorganized at 4 weeks compared to earlier or later times. Mdx muscle at 18 days have few central nuclei, suggesting that it has not yet sustained significant damage. The variance of myofiber diameter confirms that the mdx pathology is greatest at 4 weeks, when the sarcolemma is most disorganized. Sarcolemmal disorganization in the mdx does not involve contractile structures, nor is it seen in age-matched controls. In revertant mdx fibers expressing dystrophin, sarcolemmal organization is similar to controls. Our results suggest that the absence of dystrophin results in the disorganization of the sarcolemma, even in 18-day-old mice, and that the extent of disorganization is greater when the myopathy is most severe.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Although classical psychopathological studies have shown the presence of an independent diagnostic category, 'atypical psychosis', most psychotic patients are currently classified into two major diagnostic categories, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edn; DSM-IV) criteria. 'Atypical psychosis' is characterized by acute confusion without systematic delusion, emotional instability, and psychomotor excitement or stupor. Such clinical features resemble those seen in organic mental syndrome, and differential diagnosis is often difficult. Because patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) sometimes show organic mental disorder, 'atypical psychosis' may be caused by mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in some patients. In the present study whole mtDNA was sequenced for seven patients with various psychotic disorders, who could be categorized as 'atypical psychosis'. None of them had known mtDNA mutations pathogenic for mitochondrial encephalopathy. Two of seven patients belonged to a subhaplogroup F1b1a with low frequency. These results did not support the hypothesis that clinical presentation of some patients with 'atypical psychosis' is a reflection of subclinical mitochondrial encephalopathy. However, the subhaplogroup F1b1a may be a good target for association study of 'atypical psychosis'.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>DYSF encoding dysferlin is mutated in Miyoshi myopathy and Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 2B, the two main phenotypes recognized in dysferlinopathies. Dysferlin deficiency in muscle is the most relevant feature for the diagnosis of dysferlinopathy and prompts the search for mutations in DYSF. DYSF, located on chromosome 2p13, contains 55 coding exons and spans 150 kb of genomic DNA. We performed a genomic analysis of the DYSF coding sequence in 34 unrelated patients from various ethnic origins. All patients showed an absence or drastic decrease of dysferlin expression in muscle. A primary screening of DYSF using SSCP or dHPLC of PCR products of each of 55 exons of the gene was followed by sequencing whenever a sequence variation was detected. All together, 54 sequence variations were identified in DYSF, 50 of which predicting either a truncated protein or one amino-acid substitution and most of them (34 out of 54) being novel. In 23 patients, we identified two pathogenic mutations, while only one was identified in 11 patients. These mutations were widely spread in the coding sequence of the gene without any mutational "hotspot."</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A novel desmin R355P mutation has been identified in a patient with familial cardiac and skeletal myopathy. Two types of desmin storage were observed in the skeletal muscles. The spheroid-like bodies dominated in type 2 fibres while extensive accumulation of granulofilamentous material was found in type 1 fibres and in cardiomyocytes. A novel missense mutation R355P in the rod domain located in the C-terminal part of the 2B subunit is the eighth missense mutation, which changes the original aminoacid into proline. Proline is known to disrupt the alpha-helix and distort a unique stutter sequence that is critically important for proper filament assembly.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder associated with mutations in uridine diphosphate (UDP)-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) 2-epimerase (GNE)/N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) kinase (MNK), the bifunctional and rate-limiting enzyme of sialic acid biosynthesis. We developed individual GNE and MNK enzymatic assays and determined reduced activities in cultured fibroblasts of patients, with HIBM harboring missense mutations in either or both the GNE and MNK enzymatic domains. To assess the effects of individual mutations on enzyme activity, normal and mutated GNE/MNK enzymatic domains were synthesized in a cell-free in vitro transcription-translation system and subjected to the GNE and MNK enzymatic assays. This cell-free system was validated for both GNE and MNK activities, and it revealed that mutations in one enzymatic domain (in GNE, G135V, V216A, and R246W; in MNK, A631V, M712T) affected not only that domain's enzyme activity, but also the activity of the other domain. Moreover, studies of the residual enzyme activity associated with specific mutations revealed a discrepancy between the fibroblasts and the cell-free systems. Fibroblasts exhibited higher residual activities of both GNE and MNK than the cell-free system. These findings add complexity to the tightly regulated system of sialic acid biosynthesis. This cell-free approach can be applied to other glycosylation pathway enzymes that are difficult to evaluate in whole cells because their substrate specificities overlap with those of ancillary enzymes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Abnormalities in intracellular calcium release and reuptake are responsible for decreased contractility in heart failure (HF). We have previously shown that cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are protein kinase A-hyperphosphorylated and depleted of the regulatory subunit calstabin-2 in HF. Moreover, similar alterations in skeletal muscle RyR have been linked to increased fatigability in HF. To determine whether restoration of calstabin binding to RyR may ameliorate cardiac and skeletal muscle dysfunction in HF, we treated WT and calstabin-2-/-mice subjected to myocardial infarction (MI) with JTV519. JTV519, a 1,4-benzothiazepine, is a member of a class of drugs known as calcium channel stabilizers, previously shown to increase calstabin binding to RyR. Echocardiography at 21 days after MI demonstrated a significant increase in ejection fraction in WT mice treated with JTV519 (45.8 +/-5.1%) compared with placebo (31.1 +/-3.1%; P &lt; 0.05). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed increased amounts of calstabin-2 bound to the RyR2 channel in JTV519-treated WT mice. However, JTV519 did not show any of these beneficial effects in calstabin-2-/-mice with MI. Additionally, JTV519 improved skeletal muscle fatigue in WT and calstabin-2-/-mice with HF by increasing the binding of calstabin-1 to RyR1. The observation that treatment with JTV519 improved cardiac function in WT but not calstabin-2-/-mice indicates that calstabin-2 binding to RyR2 is required for the beneficial effects in failing hearts. We conclude that JTV519 may provide a specific way to treat the cardiac and skeletal muscle myopathy in HF by increasing calstabin binding to RyR.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Dominant mutations in COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3, the three genes encoding collagen type VI, a ubiquitous extracellular matrix protein, are associated with Bethlem myopathy (BM) and Ullrich scleroatonic muscular dystrophy. METHODS: The authors devised a method to screen the entire coding sequence of the three genes by reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification of total RNA from skin fibroblasts and direct sequencing of the resulting 25 overlapping cDNA fragments covering 107 exons. RESULTS: Four splicing and four missense mutations were identified in 16 patients with BM, six of which are novel mutations in COL6A1. Both common and private mutations are localized in the alpha1 (VI) chain between the regions corresponding to the 3' end of the NH2-globular domain and the 5' end of the triple helix, encoded by exons 3 through 14. CONCLUSIONS: The clustering of the mutations in a relatively narrow area of the three collagen type VI chains in patients with Bethlem myopathy (BM) suggests that mutations in different regions could result in different phenotypes or in no phenotype at all. Moreover, the detection of mutations in only 60% of the patients suggests the existence of at least another gene associated with BM. The authors propose the direct sequencing of COL6 cDNAs as the first mutation screening analysis in BM, given the high number of exon-skipping events.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>To clarify the involvement of calpains in sarcolemmal remodeling, we examined the expression of calpains and their substrate, alpha-fodrin, in various disorders of muscle. Although immunohistological reactions for alpha-fodrin and calpains were weak in normal control muscles, intense immunoreactivity for alpha-fodrin at the sarcolemma and for calpains throughout the cytoplasm were detected in small muscle fibers from patients with inflammatory myositis (IM), rhabdomyolysis (Rhab), and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Most of the calpain-alpha-fodrin double-positive muscle fibers in IM and Rhab also expressed the developmental form of myosin heavy chain. The sarcolemma of these small muscle fibers reacted with an antibody that specifically recognizes the 150-kDa fragments of alpha-fodrin (SBDP 150s) cleaved by calpain, but not caspase 3. Western blot analysis confirmed these results. These observations indicate that calpain is activated and reacts with alpha-fodrin as a substrate at the sarcolemma, and plays a key role in modulating sarcolemmal proteins to adapt to the specific conditions in each myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) is a human disease that is characterized by focal myofibrillar destruction and pathological cytoplasmic protein aggregations. In an extended German pedigree with a novel form of MFM characterized by clinical features of a limb-girdle myopathy and morphological features of MFM, we identified a co-segregating, heterozygous nonsense mutation (8130G-->A; W2710X) in the filamin c gene (FLNC) on chromosome 7q32.1. The mutation is the first found in FLNC and is localized in the dimerization domain of filamin c. Functional studies showed that, in the truncated mutant protein, this domain has a disturbed secondary structure that leads to the inability to dimerize properly. As a consequence of this malfunction, the muscle fibers of our patients display massive cytoplasmic aggregates containing filamin c and several Z-disk-associated and sarcolemmal proteins.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Defects of mitochondrial polymerase gamma (POLG) underlie neurological diseases ranging from myopathies to parkinsonism and infantile Alpers syndrome. The most severe manifestations have been associated with mutations of the 'spacer' region of POLG, the function of which has remained unstudied in humans. We identified a family, segregating three POLG amino acid variants, A467T, R627Q and Q1236H. The first two affect the spacer region and the third is a polymorphism, allelic with R627Q. Three grades of disease severity appeared to correlate with the genotypes. The patient with the most severe outcome, cerebellar ataxia syndrome, had all three variants, those with R627Q and Q1236H had juvenile-onset ptosis and gait disturbance and those with a single A467T allele had late-onset ptosis. To evaluate the molecular pathogenesis of these spacer defects, we expressed and purified the mutant proteins and studied their catalytic properties in vitro. The A467T substitution resulted in clearly decreased activity, DNA binding and processivity of the polymerase. Our biochemical data, the dominant manifestation of A467T and its previously reported high frequency in the Belgian population (0.6%), emphasize the role of this mutation as a common cause of neurological disease. Further, biochemical evidence that a polymorphic variant may modify the function of a mutant POLG, if occurring in the same polypeptide, is shown here. Finally, and surprisingly, other pathogenic spacer mutants showed DNA-binding affinities and processivities similar to or higher than the controls, suggesting that the disease-causing mechanisms of spacer mutations extend beyond the basic catalytic functions of POLG.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We describe the clinical, morphological and genetic findings in two siblings with the myopathic form of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MIM 251880). Sequencing of the thymidine kinase-2 gene revealed two heterozygous missense mutations, a C-->T mutation at nucleotide 191 resulting in a change of threonine to methionine at residue 64 in exon 3, and a C-->T mutation at nucleotide 547 resulting in an arginine to tryptophan amino acid change at residue 183 in exon 8. Both mutations changed highly conserved residues in the gene and neither one has been described previously. This report extends the phenotypic expression of mutations in the thymidine kinase-2 gene.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Primary lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2) deficiency is an X-linked disease, characterized by the clinical triad of cardiomyopathy, vacuolar myopathy and mental retardation, previously known as Danon disease. Mutations of lamp-2 gene have been reported so far in about 20 patients, one of whom was Italian. We describe a new Italian case with persistent hyperCKemia, exercise intolerance and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy but with no muscle weakness or mental impairment. Muscle biopsy revealed a vacuolar myopathy with mild glycogen storage, and immunohistochemical studies detected LAMP-2 deficiency. A new nucleotide substitution (T961C) on exon 8 of lamp-2 gene was identified as responsible for the protein deficiency. This is the first missense mutation so far described. LAMP-2 deficiency should be considered as a cause of recurrent hyperCKemia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Atorvastatin is metabolized through enzymes encoded by members of the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A gene family. Some patients who take atorvastatin along with concomitant medications known to inhibit CYP3A enzyme activity (e.g. itraconazole) develop rhabdomyolysis secondary to a severe drug-induced myopathy. The present study aimed to characterize the relationship between CYP3A gene polymorphisms and atorvastatin-induced muscle damage in the context of concomitant medication. The study employed a retrospective case--control (n=137) design. Study subjects were recruited from the general patient population served by Marshfield Clinic, a large horizontally integrated multispecialty group practice located in central Wisconsin, and case assignment was based upon both subjective (myalgia) and objective inclusion criteria [elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) levels]. The primary outcome was the relationship between serum CK level and CYP3A genotype. CYP3A genotype was not associated with an increased risk for the development of atorvastatin-induced muscle damage. CYP3A4*1B and CYP3A5*3 allele frequencies were similar in cases (n=68) and controls (n=69). Conversely, CYP3A genotype was associated with an increased severity of atorvastatin-induced muscle damage. An association was identified between the non-functional CYP3A5*3 allele and the magnitude of serum CK elevation in case patients experiencing myalgia. Patients who were homozygous for CYP3A5*3 demonstrated greater serum CK levels than patients who were heterozygous for CYP3A5*3, when concomitant lipid-lowering agents were sequentially removed from the analysis (P=0.025 without gemfibrozil, P=0.010 without gemfibrozil and niacin). The study demonstrates that patients who develop myalgia while taking atorvastatin are more likely to experience a greater degree of muscle damage if they express two copies of CYP3A5*3.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A 97-kDa protein called valosin-containing protein (VCP) has been implicated in osteosarcoma metastasis and Paget's disease of bone, two conditions that complicate the course and outcome of orthopaedic surgery. High VCP gene expression is associated with high metastatic potential in osteosarcoma cells, while loss-of-function VCP mutations cause inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD). VCP protein expression and regulation have not been examined in normal osteoblasts. The purpose of these studies was to characterize VCP protein expression in control and stressed untransformed osteoblasts. Proteins from confluent MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblast-like cells were separated by 2D IEF/SDS-PAGE. An abundant spot with a M(r) of 94 kDa and a pI of 5.4 was identified as VCP by MALDI/ToF and peptide mass fingerprint analysis. High constitutive VCP protein expression in subconfluent and confluent resting and mildly physiologically stressed MC3T3-E1 cells was confirmed by Western blotting. When assessed by indirect immunofluorescence in fixed cells or Western blotting of subcellular fractions, VCP was more abundant in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus. Induction of mild physiological stress sufficient to stimulate the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is partially dependent on VCP-mediated targeting of polyubiquitinylated substrates, did not affect steady-state VCP levels or distribution. Thus, VCP is a constitutively abundant protein in untransformed osteoblastic cells under all conditions tested. Such high levels of VCP protein expression in untransformed osteoblastic cells argue against a major causative role for it in metastasis, while the occurrence of Paget's disease in patients with missense VCP mutations supports a major role for VCP in normal osteoblast proliferation and regulation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Timothy syndrome (TS) is a multisystem disorder that causes syncope and sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias. Prominent features include congenital heart disease, immune deficiency, intermittent hypoglycemia, cognitive abnormalities, and autism. All TS individuals have syndactyly (webbing of fingers and toes). We discovered that TS resulted from a recurrent, de novo cardiac L-type calcium channel (CaV1.2) mutation, G406R. G406 is located in alternatively spliced exon 8A, encoding transmembrane segment S6 of domain I. Here, we describe two individuals with a severe variant of TS (TS2). Neither child had syndactyly. Both individuals had extreme prolongation of the QT interval on electrocardiogram, with a QT interval corrected for heart rate ranging from 620 to 730 ms, causing multiple arrhythmias and sudden death. One individual had severe mental retardation and nemaline rod skeletal myopathy. We identified de novo missense mutations in exon 8 of CaV1.2 in both individuals. One was an analogous mutation to that found in exon 8A in classic TS, G406R. The other mutation was G402S. Exon 8 encodes the same region as exon 8A, and the two are mutually exclusive. The spliced form of CaV1.2 containing exon 8 is highly expressed in heart and brain, accounting for approximately 80% of CaV1.2 mRNAs. G406R and G402S cause reduced channel inactivation, resulting in maintained depolarizing L-type calcium currents. Computer modeling showed prolongation of cardiomyocyte action potentials and delayed afterdepolarizations, factors that increase risk of arrhythmia. These data indicate that gain-of-function mutations of CaV1.2 exons 8 and 8A cause distinct forms of TS.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The dysferlin gene is defective in Miyoshi myopathy (MM) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B). Dysferlin is a sarcolemmal protein that is implicated in calcium-dependent membrane repair. Affixin (beta-parvin) is a novel, integrin-linked kinase-binding protein that is involved in the linkage between integrin and the cytoskeleton. Here we show that affixin is a dysferlin binding protein that colocalizes with dysferlin at the sarcolemma of normal human skeletal muscle. The immunoreactivity of affixin was reduced in sarcolemma of MM and LGMD2B muscles, although the total amount of the affixin protein was normal. Altered immunoreactivity of affixin was also observed in other muscle diseases including LGMD1C, where both affixin and dysferlin showed quite similar changes with a reduction of sarcolemmal staining with or without cytoplasmic accumulations. Colocalization of dysferlin and affixin was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis using dysferlin-expressing C2 myoblasts. Wild-type and mutant dysferlin colocalized with endogenous affixin. The interaction of dysferlin and affixin was confirmed by immunoprecipitation study using normal human and mouse skeletal muscles. Using immunoprecipitation with deletion mutants of dysferlin, we have identified that C-terminal region of dysferlin is an apparent binding site for affixin. We also found N-terminal calponin homology domain of affixin as a binding site for dysferlin. Our results suggest that affixin may participate in membrane repair with dysferlin.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Autosomal recessive hereditary inclusion body myopathy (AR-HIBM), with sparing of the quadriceps, is characterized by adult-onset, with weakness and atrophy of distal lower limb muscles, and typical histopathological findings in muscle biopsy. AR hIBM is associated with mutations in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene on chromosome 9p12-13 . We report two unrelated Tunisian families with clinical and pathological features of AR HIBM. One distinct homozygous GNE missense mutation, M712T, previously reported in Middle Eastern Jewish patients, and a newly identified one, L379H, were found in one patient from each family. We conclude that AR HIBM in Tunisia shows an allelic genetic heterogeneity.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Type III glycogen storage disease (GSD-III, McKusick 232400), is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, also known as Cori's or Forbe's disease. The affected enzyme is amylo-1,6-glucosidase, 4-alpha-glucanotransferase (glycogen debrancher enzyme, GDE or amylogluco-sidase, AGL), which is responsible for the debranching of the glycogen molecule during catabolism. The AGL gene is located on chromosome 1p21 and contains 35 exons translated in a monomeric protein product. The clinical manifestations of GSD-III are represented by hepatomegaly, recurrent hypoglycemia, seizures, growth failure, dysmorphism, hyperlipidemia, raised transaminases and creatine kinase concentrations and, in a number of subjects, myopathy and cardiomyopathy. The hepatocellular adenoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, diabetes mellitus and liver fibrosis remain rare events. The diagnosis of debrancher deficiency was established by laboratory tests, electromyography (EMG), and muscle and liver biopsy. METHODS: We studied six GSD-III families after patients or parental consent and the clinical characteristics were documented. Analysis of 33 exons and part exon-intron boundaries of the AGL gene in patients and their parents were carried out by PCR and direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The clinical features included hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, recurrent hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, growth failure, raised transaminases and acidosis. Administration of epinephrine 2 hours after a carbohydrate meal could provoke normal rise of blood glucose in the affected individuals, but could not evoke any response after overnight fasting. Administration of raw-corn-starch could maintain normoglycemia and improve the disease condition. Mutation analysis for patient 1 was normal. Patient 2 had a compound heterozygote: a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1294 (come from father, 1294C > T, L 298 L) in exon 8 and a G-to-T transition at nucleotide 4747 (from mother, 4747G > T, E1450X) in exon 34. Patient 3 had a compound heterozygote: a C-to-T transition at nucleotide 1294 (from father, 1294C > T, L 298 L) in exon 8 and a G-to-A transition at nucleotide -10 (from mother, -10G > A) in exon 3. Patient 4 was a homozygote: an insertion of a nucleotide CT into position +65 in exon 35 (4664 ins CT). Patient 5 had a compound heterozygote: a 8 bp deletion at nucleotide 2341 (from father, 2341delGCCATAGA, frameshift mutation) in exon 16 and a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 1559 (from mother, 1559G > A, R 387 Q) in exon 10. Patient 6 had a compound heterozygote: a T-to-G transition at nucleotide 1686 (from mother, 1686T > G, Y429 X) in exon 12 and a G-to-A transition at nucleotide 3742 (from father, 3742G > A, G 1115 R) in exon 26. CONCLUSION: GSD-III patients have variable phenotypic characteristics. Administration of raw-corn-starch can effectively improve the disease outcome. We identified 8 new mutations on AGL gene through nucleotide sequence analysis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotubularins (MTMs) belong to a large subfamily of phosphatases that dephosphorylate the 3' position of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PI(3)P] and PI(3,5)P(2). MTM1 is mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy, and MTMR2 and MTMR13 are mutated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome. However, little is known about the general mechanism(s) whereby MTMs are regulated or the specific biological processes regulated by the different MTMs. We identified a Ca(2+)-activated K channel, K(Ca)3.1 (also known as KCa4, IKCa1, hIK1, or SK4), that specifically interacts with the MTMR6 subfamily of MTMs via coiled coil (CC) domains on both proteins. Overexpression of MTMR6 inhibited K(Ca)3.1 channel activity, and this inhibition required MTMR6's CC and phosphatase domains. This inhibition is specific; MTM1, a closely related MTM, did not inhibit K(Ca)3.1. However, a chimeric MTM1 in which the MTM1 CC domain was swapped for the MTMR6 CC domain inhibited K(Ca)3.1, indicating that MTM CC domains are sufficient to confer target specificity. K(Ca)3.1 was also inhibited by the PI(3) kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin, and this inhibition was rescued by the addition of PI(3)P, but not other phosphoinositides, to the patch pipette solution. PI(3)P also rescued the inhibition of K(Ca)3.1 by MTMR6 overexpression. These data, when taken together, indicate that K(Ca)3.1 is regulated by PI(3)P and that MTMR6 inhibits K(Ca)3.1 by dephosphorylating the 3' position of PI(3)P, possibly leading to decreased PI(3)P in lipid microdomains adjacent to K(Ca)3.1. K(Ca)3.1 plays important roles in controlling proliferation by T cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and some cancer cell lines. Thus, our findings not only provide unique insights into the regulation of K(Ca)3.1 channel activity but also raise the possibility that MTMs play important roles in the negative regulation of T cells and in conditions associated with pathological cell proliferation, such as cancer and atherosclerosis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Human centronuclear and myotubular myopathies belong to a genetically heterogeneous nosological group with clinical variability ranging from fatal disorder to mild weakness. The severe X-linked form is attributed to more than 200 different mutations in the myotubularin encoding gene (MTM1). In contrast, there are no reports regarding the molecular etiology or linkage studies on the autosomal forms of the disease. Labrador retrievers affected by spontaneous centronuclear myopathy (cnm) have clinical and histological features of the human disorder and represent the first model of recessive autosomal centronuclear myopathy. We previously mapped the cnm locus to the centromeric region of canine chromosome 2. No gene of the MTM1 family maps to the human homologous chromosomal region. Described herein is a disease-associated insertion within PTPLA exon 2, found in both alleles of all affected Labradors and in a single allele in obligate carriers. The inserted tRNA-derived short interspersed repeat element (SINE) has a striking effect on the maturation of PTPLA mRNA, whereby it can be spliced out, partially exonized or involved in multiple exon-skipping. As a result, the amount of wild-type transcripts falls to 1% in affected muscles. This example therefore recapitulates cumulative SINE-associated transcriptional defects that have been previously described as exclusive consequences of independent mutations. Although the function of PTPLA in metazoa remains unknown, the characterization of a hypomorphic mutation in Labradors with centronuclear myopathy provides new clues about the molecular complexity of skeletal myofiber homeostasis. These results also suggest that impaired PTPLA signaling might be implicated in human myopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The SJL mouse is a model for human dysferlinopathy (limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and Miyoshi myopathy). We used cDNA microarrays to compare the expression profiles of 10,012 genes in control and SJL quadriceps femoris muscles in order to find genes involved in the degeneration and regeneration process and in dysferlin's functional network. Many genes involved in the process of muscle regeneration are observed to be up-regulated in SJL mice, including cardiac ankyrin repeated protein (CARP), Neuraminidase 2, interleukin-6, insulin-like growth factor-2 and osteopontin. We found the upregulation of S100 calcium binding proteins, neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated gene 4-like (NEDD4L) with C2 domain, and intracellular protein traffic associated proteins (Rab6 and Rab2). These proteins have the potential to interact with dysferlin. We must reveal some other molecules which may work with dysferlin in order to clarify the pathological network of dysferlinopathy. This process may lead to future improvements in the therapy for human dysferlinopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations of the human desmin gene on chromosome 2q35 cause a familial or sporadic form of skeletal myopathy frequently associated with cardiac abnormalities. Here, we report the pathogenic effects of a novel heterozygous R350P desmin missense mutation, which resides in the evolutionary highly conserved coil 2B domain of the alpha-helical coiled-coil desmin rod domain, on the assembly of desmin intermediate filaments (IF) in cultured cells and in vitro. By transfection experiments, we show that R350P desmin is incapable of de novo formation of a desmin IF network in vimentin-free BMGE+H, MCF7 and SW13 cells and that it disrupts the endogenous vimentin cytoskeleton in 3T3 fibroblast cells. Hence, transfected cells displayed abnormal cytoplasmic protein aggregates reminiscent of desmin-positive protein deposits seen in the immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analysis of skeletal muscle derived from the index patient of the affected family. To study the functional effects of the R350P desmin mutation at the protein level, we performed in vitro assembly studies with wild-type (WT) and mutant desmin protein. Our analysis revealed that the in vitro assembly process of R350P desmin is already disturbed at the unit length filament level and that further association reactions generate huge, tightly packed protein aggregates. On assessing the pathogenic effects of R350P desmin in various mixtures with WT desmin, we show that a ratio of 1 : 3 (R350P desmin/WT desmin) is sufficient to effectively block the normal polymerization process of desmin IFs. Our findings indicate that the heterozygous R350P desmin mutation exerts a dominant negative effect on the ordered lateral arrangement of desmin subunits. This disturbance of the lateral packing taking place in the first phase of assembly is ultimately leading to abnormal protein aggregation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in SEPN1 have been associated with three autosomal recessive congenital myopathies, including rigid spine muscular dystrophy, multiminicore disease and desmin-related myopathy with Mallory body-like inclusions. These disorders constitute the SEPN1 related myopathies (SEPN-RM). On the basis of clinical and laboratory features compatible with SEPN-RM, we performed mutation analysis of SEPN1 in 11 unrelated patients and found one case with pathogenic mutations. He showed early onset axial muscle weakness and developed scoliosis with respiratory insufficiency. Muscle biopsy showed increased variability of fiber size and slight, focal increase of connective tissue. A few fibers showed mini-core changes. SEPN1 mutation analysis revealed that the patient was a compound heterozygote: a previously described insertion (713-714 insA), and a novel nonsense mutation (R439stop).</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A family with several cases of severe cardiomyopathy and moderate myopathy is described, affecting two brothers and their cousin as well as their mothers. One boy died of sudden cardiac arrest at 17 years of age. The two brothers were treated with an implantable defibrillator and their mother died suddenly at 40 years of age. Muscle biopsy in males showed vacuolar myopathy in two cases, and no abnormality on standard staining in the third case. Cardiac biopsies showed hypertrophic and vacuolated fibres. Complete absence of LAMP-2 was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry on the vacuolated skeletal and cardiac muscle, but also on the morphologically normal skeletal muscle. Sequencing of LAMP-2 gene showed a novel S157X mutation in exon 4. Danon disease is a rare and potentially lethal cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Diagnosis can be made by immunohistochemistry performed on cardiac or muscle biopsy, and confirmed by genetic analysis, which also allows for easy family screening and counselling.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Sarcotubular myopathy (OMIM 268950) is a rare autosomal recessive myopathy first described in two Hutterite brothers from South Dakota and in two non-Hutterite brothers from Germany. We report that sarcotubular myopathy (STM) is caused by mutation in TRIM32, the gene encoding the tripartite motif-containing protein 32. TRIM32 was found to be the gene mutated in limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H (LGMD2H [OMIM 254110]), a disorder that has been confined to the Hutterite population. The TRIM32 mutation found in the STM patients is identical to the causative mutation for LGMD2H (D487N), Haplotype analysis shows that the disease chromosomes share common ancestry.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotonia congenita is a hereditary chloride channel disorder characterized by delayed relaxation of skeletal muscle (myotonia). It is caused by mutations in the skeletal muscle chloride channel gene CLCN1 on chromosome 7. The phenotypic spectrum of myotonia congenita ranges from mild myotonia disclosed only by clinical examination to severe and disabling myotonia with transient weakness and myopathy. The most severe phenotypes are seen in patients with two mutated alleles. Heterozygotes are often asymptomatic but for some mutations heterozygosity is sufficient to cause pronounced myotonia, although without weakness and myopathy. Thus, the phenotype depends on the mutation type to some extent, but this does not explain the fact that severity varies greatly between heterozygous family members and may even vary with time in the individual patient. In this review, existing knowledge about phenotypic variability is summarized, and the possible contributing factors are discussed.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A missense mutation in the PUS1 gene affecting a highly conserved amino acid has been associated with mitochondrial myopathy and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA), a rare autosomal recessive oxidative phosphorylation disorder. The PUS1 gene encodes the enzyme pseudouridine synthase 1 (Pus1p) that is known to pseudouridylate tRNAs in other species. Total RNA was isolated from lymphoblastoid cell lines established from patients, parents, unaffected siblings, and unrelated controls, and the tRNAs were assayed for the presence of pseudouridine (Psi) at the expected positions. Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic tRNAs from MLASA patients are lacking modification at sites normally modified by Pus1p, whereas tRNAs from controls, unaffected siblings, or parents all have Psi at these positions. In addition, there was no Pus1p activity in an extract made from a cell line derived from a patient with MLASA. Immunohistochemical staining of Pus1p in cell lines showed nuclear, cytoplasmic, and mitochondrial distribution of the protein, and there is no difference in staining between patients and unaffected family members. MLASA is thus associated with absent or greatly reduced tRNA pseudouridylation at specific sites, implicating this pathway in its molecular pathogenesis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>AIMS: Familial dilated cardiomyopathy (FDCM) is associated with mutations in more than 10 genes, but genes mutation frequencies and associated clinical features remain largely unknown. Here, we performed a mutation analysis of four genes involved in FDCM in a population of idiopathic DCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: A SSCP and sequencing mutation screening of all the exons coding for beta myosin heavy chain (MYH7 gene), cardiac T troponin (TNNT2 gene), phospholamban (PLN gene), and the cardio-specific exon of metavinculin (VCL gene) were performed in 96 independent patients (54 familial and 42 sporadic). It led to the identification of eight heterozygous mutations, seven new ones in MYH7, and the already described R141W mutation in TNNT2. MYH7 mutations (in five familial and two sporadic cases) substitute residues located either in the head (I201T, T412N, A550V) or tail domains (T1019N, R1193S, E1426K, R1634S) of the protein. DCM was not associated with skeletal myopathy or conduction defects in any patients. Contrasting clinical features were observed between MYH7 and TNNT2 mutations carriers. In MYH7 vs. TNNT2, mean age at diagnosis was late (P&lt;0.03), penetrance was incomplete in adults (56 vs. 100%), and mean age at major cardiac event was higher (P&lt;0.04). CONCLUSION: We have identified seven mutations in MYH7, one in TNNT2, and none in PLN or in the VCL cardio-specific exon. MYH7 appears as the most frequently mutated gene in our FDCM population (approximately 10%), and mutation carriers present with delayed onset, in contrast to TNNT2.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical expression of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) gene mutations (PRKAG2) in adenosine monophosphate (AMP) kinase disease based on 12 years follow-up of known mutation carriers and to define the prevalence of PRKAG2 mutations in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). BACKGROUND: Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase gene mutations cause HCM with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and conduction disease. METHODS: Clinical evaluation of 44 patients with known AMP kinase disease was analyzed. Mutation analysis of PRKAG2 was performed by fluorescent single-strand confirmation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing of abnormal conformers in 200 patients with HCM. RESULTS: Only one additional mutation was identified. The mean age at clinical diagnosis in the 45 gene carriers was 24 years (median 20 years, range 9 to 55 years). Symptoms of palpitation, dypspnea, chest pain, or syncope were present in 31 (69%) gene carriers; 7 (15%) complained of myalgia and had clinical evidence of proximal myopathy. Skeletal muscle biopsy showed excess mitochondria and ragged red fibers with minimal glycogen accumulation. Disease penetrance defined by typical electrocardiogram abnormalities was 100% by age 18 years. Thirty-two of 41 adults (78%) had left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on echocardiography, and progressive LVH was documented during follow-up. Survival was 91% at a mean follow-up of 12.2 years. Progressive conduction disease required pacemaker implantation in 17 of 45 (38%) at a mean age of 38 years. CONCLUSIONS: The AMP kinase disease is uncommon in HCM and is characterized by progressive conduction disease and cardiac hypertrophy and includes extracardiac manifestations such as a skeletal myopathy, consistent with a systemic metabolic storage disease. Defects in adenosine triphosphate utilization or in specific cellular substrates, rather than mere passive deposition of amylopectin, may account for these clinical features.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The bifunctional enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) is essential for early embryonic development and catalyzes the rate limiting step in sialic acid biosynthesis. Although epimerase and kinase activities have been attributed to GNE, little is known about the regulation, differential expression, and subcellular localization of GNE in vivo. Mutations in GNE cause a rare inherited muscle disorder in humans called hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM). However, the role of GNE in HIBM pathogenesis has not been defined yet. Here, we show that the GNE protein is expressed in various mammalian cells and tissues with highest levels found in cancer cells and liver. In human skeletal muscle, GNE protein is developmentally regulated: high levels are found in immature myoblasts but low levels in mature skeletal muscle. The GNE protein colocalizes with resident proteins of the Golgi compartment in a variety of human cells including muscle. Drug-induced disruption of the Golgi and subsequent recovery reveals co-distribution of GNE along with Golgi-targeted proteins. This subcellular localization of GNE is in good agreement with its established role as the key enzyme of sialic acid biosynthesis, since the sialylation of glycoconjugates takes place in the Golgi complex. Surprisingly, GNE is also detected in the nucleus. Upon nocodazole treatment, GNE redistributes to the cytoplasm suggesting that GNE may act as a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein. A regulatory role for GNE shifting between the nuclear and the Golgi compartment is proposed. Further insight into GNE regulation may promote the understanding of HIBM pathogenesis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) treatment of HIV is associated with complications, including lipodystrophy (LD) and myopathy. Inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase and depletion of mtDNA by NRTI triphosphates are believed to be key mechanisms in NRTI toxicity. Here, we determined the activities and mRNA levels of deoxynucleoside kinases (dNK) and 5'-nucleotidases (5'-NT) controlling the rate-limiting step in intracellular phosphorylation of NRTIs in cell models representing adipose, muscle tissue and peripheral blood cells using specific assays and Taqman RT-PCR. In vitro phosphorylation of 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT) and 2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (d4T) in extracts was also determined. 3T3-L1 adipocytes showed similar activity of mitochondrial thymidine kinase-2 (TK2) and deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) but 3-to 36-fold lower levels of cytosolic deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), thymidine kinase-1 (TK1) and thymidine monophosphate kinase (TMPK) and higher levels of deoxyribonucleotidase activity compared to proliferating 3T3-L1. dCK, dGK and TK2 activities correlated with their mRNA levels in proliferating, resting and differentiating 3T3-L1. Differentiated L6 myoblasts had lower activities of cytosolic dNK's and TMPK, higher dGK and similar TK2 and deoxyribonucleotidases (dNT) activities compared to proliferating myoblasts. TK2 was the limiting dNK activity while dGK was predominant in adipocytes and myocytes. Activity profiles revealed limited capacity to phosphorylate dThd and dCyd in adipocytes and myocytes compared to proliferating cells and CEM lymphocytes. Phosphorylation of AZT and d4T was low in adipocytes and myocytes, and the presence of these analogs inhibited the phosphorylation of dThd by TK2 suggesting that mitochondrial toxicity of some NRTIs in adipocytes and myocytes is due to the depletion of normal mitochondrial dNTP pools.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We recently described a new autosomal dominant myopathy associated with a missense mutation in the myosin heavy chain (MyHC) IIa gene (MYH2). In this study, we performed mutation analysis of MYH2 in eight Swedish patients with familial myopathy of unknown cause. In two of the eight index cases, we identified novel heterozygous missense mutations in MYH2, one in each case: V970I and L1061V. The mutations were located in subfragment 2 of the MyHC and they changed highly conserved residues. Most family members carrying the mutations had signs and symptoms consisting mainly of mild muscle weakness and myalgia. In addition, we analyzed the extent and distribution of nucleotide variation in MYH2 in 50 blood donors, who served as controls, by the complete sequencing of all 38 exons comprising the coding region. We identified only six polymorphic sites, five of which were synonymous polymorphisms. One variant, which occurred at an allele frequency of 0.01, was identical to the L1061V that was also found in one of the families with myopathy. The results of the analysis of normal variation indicate that there is strong selective pressure against mutations in MYH2. On the basis of these results, we suggest that MyHC genes should be regarded as candidate genes in cases of hereditary myopathies of unknown etiology.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests mitochondrial dysfunction in bipolar disorder. Analyses of mitochondria-related genes using DNA microarray showed significantly increased LARS2 (mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase) in the postmortem prefrontal cortices of patients with bipolar disorder provided by the Stanley Foundation Brain Collection. LARS2 is a nuclear gene encoding the enzyme catalyzing the aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNA(Leu). A well-studied mitochondrial DNA point mutation, 3243A>G, in the region of tRNA(Leu (UUR)), related with MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes), is known to decrease the efficiency of aminoacylation of tRNA(Leu (UUR)). METHODS: The steady state level of LARS2 was examined in the transmitochondrial cybrids carrying 3243A>G. We examined the 3243A>G mutation in these brains using the peptide nucleic acid-clamped polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism method. RESULTS: LARS2 was upregulated in the transmitochrondrial cybrids carrying 3243A>G. The 3243A>G was detected in the postmortem brains of two patients with bipolar disorder and one with schizophrenia. These patients also showed higher levels of the mutation in their livers and significantly higher gene expression of LARS2 compared with other subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that upregulation of LARS2 is a hallmark of 324A>G mutation. The accumulation of 3243A>G mutation in the brain may have a pathophysiologic role in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Expression of alpha-cardiac myosin heavy chain gene (alphaMHC) is developmentally regulated in normal embryonic hearts and down-regulated in cardiac myopathy and failing hearts. Jumonji (JMJ) has been shown to be critical for normal cardiovascular development and functions as a transcriptional repressor. Here, we demonstrate that JMJ represses alphaMHC expression through inhibition of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) activity. In primary cardiomyocytes, overexpression of JMJ leads to marked reduction of endogenous alphaMHC expression. JMJ represses the synergistic activation of alphaMHC by MEF2 and thyroid hormone receptor (TR). Interestingly, JMJ inhibits transcriptional activities of all MEF2 isoforms, but not the TR-dependent activation. The transcriptional repression domain of JMJ interacts with the N-terminal part of MEF2A, resulting in the repression of MEF2A activities. These results suggest that JMJ represses alphaMHC expression via protein-protein interaction with MEF2A.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Desmin, the major muscle-specific intermediate filament (IF) protein, is essential for mitochondrial behavior and function and maintenance of healthy muscle. Mice null for desmin develop dilated cardiomyopathy characterized by extensive cardiomyocyte death, fibrosis, calcification and eventual heart failure. We sought to investigate the heart mitochondrial proteome of wild type and desmin null mice in order to understand the cardiac and skeletal myopathy phenotype of desmin deficiency. The proteins were analyzed by 2-D electrophoresis, followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Three hundred and eighty different gene products were identified, about 50% of which were enzyme subunits. Cytoskeletal and muscle-specific proteins, calcium-binding proteins, proteins with various other functions and about 70 unknown, hypothetical or poorly described gene products, were also identified. We have observed differences in most metabolic pathways, in apoptosis, calcium homeostasis, calcification and fibrosis and in different signaling pathways linked or not to mitochondrial function. The most significant changes were observed in ketone body and acetate metabolism, NADH shuttle proteins, amino-acid metabolism proteins and respiratory enzymes. Several of these changes are consistent with the known phenotype of desmin deficiency.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene on chromosome 9p13-p12 recently have been shown to cause autosomal dominant inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget's disease of the bone and frontotemporal dementia. Here, we report the central nervous system autopsy findings in a 55-year-old German patient with inclusion body myopathy and frontotemporal dementia who harbors a heterozygous R155C missense mutation residing in the N-terminal CDC48 domain of VCP, which is involved in ubiquitin binding. We demonstrate that mutant VCP causes a novel type of frontotemporal dementia characterized by neuronal nuclear inclusions containing ubiquitin and VCP.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked myotubular myopathy is a congenital muscle disorder due to MTM1 mutation, and is characterized clinically by generalized muscle weakness and hypotonia at birth usually resulting in early death. We newly identified 26 unrelated Japanese patients with MTM1 mutations by genomic DNA and transcript analysis, including 12 novel mutations. Among 31 patients, including our previously reported five patients, the c.1261-10A>G splice site mutation was the most frequent mutation. Three mutations, one missense and two splice site, were associated with milder phenotype. Of particular interest, one boy had a 240 kb deletion in Xq28 encompassing CXorf6 (formerly F18), MTM1 and MTMR1 but was not accompanied by hypogenitalism. CXorf6, which have been implicated in male sexual development, was not entirely deleted in this boy, resulting in the fusion with the MTMR1 gene. A chimeric fusion transcript was detected in patient's muscle by RT-PCR, suggesting this fusion gene product avoids the phenotype. This deletion led us to refine the critical region of CXorf6 for the development of male genitalia.</rdfs:comment>

Mutations recently were identified in the type 1 muscle fiber myosin gene (MYH7) in Swedish and Saudi families with myosin storage myopathy. The authors have identified the arginine 1845 tryptophan mutation found in the Swedish families in two isolated Belgian cases, indicating a critical role for myosin residue arginine 1845.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Remodeling of adherens junction, gap junction, and desmosomal proteins at the intercalated discs of cardiomyocytes in heart characterizes several animal models of cardiomyopathy, especially dilated cardiac myopathy (DCM). In this study, we show that the tight junction protein, claudin-5, is present in cardiac muscle and localizes to the lateral membranes of cardiomyocytes in normal mice. We further examined claudin-5 in utrophin/dystrophin-deficient (double knockout, dko) mice, a mouse model of muscular dystrophy with cardiomyopathy, and found that claudin-5 mRNA and protein levels are decreased in dko hearts as compared with normal. Intercalated disc cell junction proteins, and another tight junction protein, zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), are not altered in the dko mouse. Ultrastructural data from dko hearts also shows that the lateral membranes of cardiomyocytes exhibit an abnormal wavy appearance. These data demonstrate that claudin-5 is specifically altered in dko hearts, suggesting that alterations of the lateral membranes of cardiomyocytes, rather than intercalated discs, are associated with cardiomyopathy in the dko mouse.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>INTRODUCTION: Mutations in the genes encoding collagen VI (COL6A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3) cause Bethlem myopathy (BM) and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD). BM is a relatively mild dominantly inherited disorder with proximal weakness and distal joint contractures. UCMD is an autosomal recessive condition causing severe muscle weakness with proximal joint contractures and distal hyperlaxity. METHODS: We developed a method for rapid direct sequence analysis of all 107 coding exons of the COL6 genes using single condition amplification/internal primer (SCAIP) sequencing. We have sequenced all three COL6 genes from genomic DNA in 79 patients with UCMD or BM. RESULTS: We found putative mutations in one of the COL6 genes in 62% of patients. This more than doubles the number of identified COL6 mutations. Most of these changes are consistent with straightforward autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance. However, some patients showed changes in more than one of the COL6 genes, and our results suggest that some UCMD patients may have dominantly acting mutations rather than recessive disease. DISCUSSION: Our findings may explain some or all of the cases of UCMD that are unlinked to the COL6 loci under a recessive model. The large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms which we generated in the course of this work may be of importance in determining the major phenotypic variability seen in this group of disorders.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>PURPOSE: High-resolution orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to investigate the structural basis of ocular motility abnormalities in humans with congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles type 1 (CFEOM1) due to missense mutations in the developmental kinesin KIF21A. METHODS: Clinical ophthalmic and motility findings in 19 volunteers from six unrelated CFEOM1 pedigrees harboring four of the six reported KIF21A mutations and 23 normal control subjects were correlated with MRI studies demonstrating extraocular muscle (EOM) size, location, contractility, and innervation. RESULTS: Subjects with CFEOM1 had severe bilateral blepharoptosis, limited supraduction, and variable ophthalmoplegia. In affected subjects, MRI demonstrated atrophy of the levator palpebrae superioris and superior rectus EOMs and small or absent orbital motor nerves. The oculomotor nerve was most severely hypoplastic, but the abducens was also affected. EOMs exhibited variable atrophy and an abnormally bright T1 signal. Subjects with the R954W and R954Q substitutions frequently exhibited A-pattern strabismus, with misinnervation of the lateral rectus muscle by an oculomotor nerve branch. Rectus pulley locations were generally normal. Subjects with CFEOM1 exhibited subclinical but highly significant reduction from normal in mean optic nerve size (P &lt; 0.001). Comparing clinical and MRI phenotypes did not reveal distinguishing features among KIF21A mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Orbital imaging in CFEOM1 due to various amino acid substitutions in the kinesin KIF21A demonstrates consistent abnormalities of motor and sensory innervation in the orbit. These findings suggest that neuronal disease is primary in CFEOM1, with myopathy arising secondary to abnormal innervation and minimal rectus pulley abnormality secondary to reduced EOM forces.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) is a unique group of neuromuscular disorders characterized by adult-onset, slowly progressive distal and proximal muscle weakness, which is caused by mutations in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE), the key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of sialic acid. In order to investigate the consequences of the mutated GNE enzyme in muscle cells, we have established cell cultures from muscle biopsies carrying either kinase or epimerase mutations. While all myoblasts carrying a mutated GNE gene show a reduction in their epimerase activity, only the cells derived from the patient carrying a homozygous epimerase mutation present also a significant reduction in the overall membrane bound sialic acid. These results indicate that although mutations in each of the two GNE domains result in an impaired enzymatic activity and the same HIBM phenotype, they do not equally affect the overall sialylation of muscle cells. This lack of correlation suggests that the pathological mechanism of the disease may not be linked solely to the well-characterized sialic acid pathway.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) is a morphologically distinct disorder in which disintegration of the Z-disk and then of the myofibrils is followed by abnormal accumulation of multiple proteins. Mutations in desmin, alphaB-crystallin, and myotilin, all Z-disk-related proteins, cause MFM in the minority of cases. ZASP (a Z-band alternatively spliced PDZ motif-containing protein) is another Z-disk-associated protein, and targeted deletion of ZASP in mouse causes skeletal and cardiac myopathy. We therefore searched for mutations in ZASP in 54 MFM patients and detected 3 heterozygous missense mutations in 11. Their age at onset was 44 to 73 years. Dominant inheritance was apparent in seven patients, cardiac involvement in three, and signs of peripheral neuropathy in five. Most patients had proximal and distal weakness, but in six, the weakness was greater distally than proximally. Ten carried either of two mutations in exon 6 (A147T and A165V) at or within a motif important in linking ZASP to the Z-disk; one carried a missense mutation in exon 9 (R268C). We conclude that (1) mutations in ZASP cause stereotyped MFM pathology; (2) cardiomyopathy, distal more than proximal weakness, and neuropathy are in the spectrum of zaspopathy; and (3) mutations in ZASP define a novel form of autosomal dominant muscular dystrophy in humans.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A nonsense mutation at codon Glu180 in exon 11 of slow skeletal muscle troponin T (TnT) gene (TNNT1) causes an autosomal-recessive inherited nemaline myopathy. We previously reported the absence of intact or prematurely terminated slow TnT polypeptide in Amish nemaline myopathy (ANM) patient muscle. The present study further investigates the expression and fate of mutant slow TnT in muscle cells. Intact slow TnT mRNA was readily detected in patient muscle, indicating unaffected transcription and RNA splicing. Sequence of the cloned cDNAs revealed the single nucleotide mutation in two alternatively spliced isoforms of slow TnT mRNA. Mutant TNNT1 cDNA is translationally active in Escherichia coli and non-muscle eukaryotic cells, producing the expected truncated slow TnT protein. The mutant mRNA was expressed at significant levels in differentiated C2C12 myotubes, but unlike intact exogenous TnT, truncated slow TnT protein was not detected. Transfective expression in undifferentiated myoblasts produced slow TnT mRNA but not a detectable amount of truncated or intact slow TnT proteins, indicating a muscle cell-specific proteolysis of TnT when it is not integrated into myofilaments. The slow TnT-(1-179) fragment has substantially lower affinity for binding to tropomyosin, in keeping with the loss of one of two tropomyosin-binding sites. Our findings suggest that inefficient incorporation into myofilament is responsible for the instability of mutant slow TnT in ANM muscle. Rapid degradation of the truncated slow TnT protein, rather than instability of the nonsense mRNA, provides the protective mechanism against the potential dominant negative effect of the mutant TnT fragment.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Transient kinetic measurements of the actomyosin ATPase provided the basis of the Lymn-Taylor model for the cross-bridge cycle, which underpins current models of contraction. Following the determination of the structure of the myosin motor domain, it has been possible to introduce probes at defined sites and resolve the steps in more detail. Probes have been introduced in the Dicytostelium myosin II motor domain via three routes: (i) single tryptophan residues at strategic locations throughout the motor domain; (ii) green fluorescent protein fusions at the N and C termini; and (iii) labelled cysteine residues engineered across the actin-binding cleft. These studies are interpreted with reference to motor domain crystal structures and suggest that the tryptophan (W501) in the relay loop senses the lever arm position, which is controlled by the switch 2 open-to-closed transition at the active site. Actin has little effect on this process per se. A mechanism of product release is proposed in which actin has an indirect effect on the switch 2 and lever arm position to achieve mechanochemical coupling. Switch 1 closing appears to be a key step in the nucleotide-induced actin dissociation, while its opening is required for the subsequent activation of product release. This process has been probed with F239W and F242W substitutions in the switch 1 loop. The E706K mutation in skeletal myosin IIa is associated with a human myopathy. To simulate this disease we investigated the homologous mutation, E683K, in the Dictyostelium myosin motor domain.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) and deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) are the two key enzymes in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) precursor synthesis. Deficiencies in TK2 or dGK activity, due to genetic alteration, have been shown to cause tissue-specific depletion of mtDNA. In the case of TK2 deficiency, affected individuals suffer severe myopathy and, in the case of dGK deficiency, devastating liver or multi-systemic disease. Here, we report clinical and biochemical findings from two patients with mtDNA depletion syndrome. Patient A was a compound heterozygote carrying the previously reported T77M mutation and a novel mutation (R161K) in the TK2 gene. Patient B carried a novel mutation (L250S) in the dGK gene. The clinical symptoms of patient A included muscular weakness and exercise intolerance due to a severe mitochondrial myopathy associated with a 92% reduction in mtDNA. There was minimal involvement of other organs. Patient B suffered from rapidly progressive, early onset fatal liver failure associated with profoundly decreased mtDNA levels in liver and, to a lesser extent, in skeletal muscle. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce the mutations detected in patients A and B into the TK2 and dGK cDNAs, respectively. We then characterized each of these recombinant enzymes. Catalytic activities of the three mutant enzymes were reduced to about 2-4% for TK2 and 0.5% for dGK as compared to the wild-type enzymes. Altered competition between dCyd and dThd was observed for the T77M mutant. The residual activities of the two mitochondrial enzymes correlated directly with disease development.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report a young girl with a phenotype combining early-onset myopathy and a progeria. She had myopathy and marked axial weakness during the first year of life; progeroid features, including growth failure, sclerodermatous skin changes, and osteolytic lesions, developed later. We identified the underlying cause to be a hitherto unreported de novo missense mutation in the LMNA gene (S143F) encoding the nuclear envelope proteins lamins A and C. Although LMNA mutations have been known to cause Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, this is the first report of a patient combining features of these two phenotypes because of a single mutation in LMNA.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The carnitine transporter defect (McKusick 212140) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the SLC22A5 gene, which encodes the high-affinity carnitine transporter OCTN2 (Wang et al 2001). Diagnosis is suspected when plasma carnitine levels are extremely low and secondary causes of carnitine loss are excluded. The disease can present with recurrent Reye-like episodes of hypoketotic hypoglycaemia or with cardiomyopathy associated with myopathy (Stanley et al 1991). Here we report novel clinical findings in a 3-year-old with primary carnitine deficiency.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding thymidine phosphorylase (TP). The disease is characterized clinically by impaired eye movements, gastrointestinal dysmotility, cachexia, peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, and leukoencephalopathy. Molecular genetic studies of MNGIE patients' tissues have revealed multiple deletions, depletion, and site-specific point mutations of mitochondrial DNA. TP is a cytosolic enzyme required for nucleoside homeostasis. In MNGIE, TP activity is severely reduced and consequently levels of thymidine and deoxyuridine in plasma are dramatically elevated. We have hypothesized that the increased levels of intracellular thymidine and deoxyuridine cause imbalances of mitochondrial nucleotide pools that, in turn, lead to the mtDNA abnormalities. MNGIE was the first molecularly characterized genetic disorder caused by abnormal mitochondrial nucleoside/nucleotide metabolism. Future studies are likely to reveal further insight into this expanding group of diseases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Caveolin-3 deficiency is a rare, autosomal dominant, muscle disorder caused by caveolin-3 gene (CAV3) mutations and consists of four clinical phenotypes: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1C (LGMD-1C), rippling muscle disease, distal myopathy, and familial hyperCKemia. So far, only 13 mutations have been reported. We here report two novel heterozygous mutations, 96C>G (N32K) and 128T>A (V43E), in the CAV3 gene in two unrelated Japanese families with LGMD-1C. Both probands presented with elevated serum CK level with calf muscle hypertrophy in their childhood but without apparent muscle weakness. However, their mothers showed mild limb-girdle weakness in addition to high CK level. Caveolin-3 was deficient and caveolae were lacking in muscles from both patients. Our data confirm that caveolin-3 deficiency causes LGMD-1C and expand the variability in CAV3 gene mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene are associated with a wide range of phenotypes, comprising central core disease and distinct subgroups of multi-minicore disease. We report muscle MRI findings of 11 patients from eight families with RYR1 mutations (n=9) or confirmed linkage to the RYR1 locus (n=2). Patients had clinical features of a congenital myopathy with a wide variety of associated histopathological changes. Muscle MR images showed a consistent pattern characterized by (a) within the thigh: selective involvement of vasti, sartorius, adductor magnus and relative sparing of rectus, gracilis and adductor longus; (b) within the lower leg: selective involvement of soleus, gastrocnemii and peroneal group and relative sparing of the tibialis anterior. Our findings indicate that patients with RYR1-related congenital myopathies have a recognizable pattern of muscle involvement irrespective of the variability of associated histopathological findings. Muscle MRI may supplement clinical assessment and aid selection of genetic tests particularly in patients with non-diagnostic or equivocal histopathological features.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the three collagen VI genes COL6A1, COL6A2 and COL6A3 cause Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD). UCMD, a severe disorder characterized by congenital muscle weakness, proximal joint contractures and marked distal joint hyperextensibility, has been considered a recessive condition, and homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations have been defined in COL6A2 and COL6A3. In contrast, the milder disorder Bethlem myopathy shows clear dominant inheritance and is caused by heterozygous mutations in COL6A1, COL6A2 and COL6A3. This model, where dominant mutations cause mild Bethlem myopathy and recessive mutations cause severe UCMD was recently challenged when a patient with UCMD was shown to have a heterozygous in-frame deletion in COL6A1. We have studied five patients with a clinical diagnosis of UCMD. Three patients had heterozygous in-frame deletions in the N-terminal region of the triple helical domain, one in the alpha1(VI) chain, one in alpha2(VI) and one in alpha3(VI). Collagen VI protein biosynthesis and assembly studies showed that these mutations act in a dominant negative fashion and result in severe collagen VI matrix deficiencies. One patient had recessive amino acid changes in the C2 subdomain of alpha2(VI), which prevented collagen VI assembly. No collagen VI mutations were found in the fifth patient. These data demonstrate that rather than being a rare cause of UCMD, dominant mutations are common in UCMD, now accounting for four of the 14 published cases. Mutation detection in this disorder remains critical for accurate genetic counseling of patients and their families.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to characterize the ability of alcohol to suppress insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I stimulation of ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, which are central elements in the signal transduction pathway used to coordinate the protein synthetic response and may contribute to the development of alcoholic myopathy. METHODS: In vivo studies examined the dose and time dependency of the ability of alcohol to impair signal transduction under basal and IGF-I-stimulated conditions. Additional studies examined the effect of gender, nutritional state, and route of alcohol administration. A separate study determined the direct effects of alcohol on muscle metabolism by using the isolated perfused hindlimb preparation. RESULTS: The phosphorylation of S6K1 and S6 in muscle was increased after injection of IGF-I in control rats. In contrast, IGF-I failed to stimulate S6K1 or S6 phosphorylation 2.5 hr after intraperitoneal administration of alcohol when the blood alcohol concentration was increased between approximately 165 and 300 mg/dl. With a maximal suppressive dose of alcohol, the inhibitory effect on S6K1/S6 phosphorylation was observed as early as 1 hr and for up to 8 hr. The ability of alcohol to impair phosphorylation of S6K1 and S6 was independent of gender (male versus female), nutritional status (fed versus fasted), and route of alcohol administration (intraperitoneal versus oral). Furthermore, the suppressive effect of alcohol was still observed in rats pretreated with 4-methylpyrazole, suggesting that the response was independent of the oxidative metabolism of ethanol. The direct effect of alcohol on IGF-stimulated S6K1/S6 phosphorylation was also present when the isolated hindlimb was perfused in situ with buffer containing alcohol. In contrast to S6K1, acute alcohol intoxication did not consistently impair the ability of IGF-I to stimulate 4E-BP1 phosphorylation under any of the experimental conditions. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that acute alcohol intoxication selectively impairs IGF-I signaling via S6K1, but not 4E-BP1, and that this defect is independent of gender, nutritional state, route of administration, and alcohol metabolism. The IGF-I resistance may represent a participating mechanism by which alcohol directly limits the translation of selected messenger RNAs and, ultimately, protein synthesis in skeletal muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Among patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP), those with transthyretin Val30Met mainly show distally predominant weakness and atrophy, whereas some FAP patients, including those with transthyretin Ser50Ile and Tyr114Cys, show muscle weakness and atrophy that is dominant proximally, simulating myopathy. To clarify the cause of proximally dominant muscular atrophy in patients with FAP transthyretin Ser50Ile and Tyr114Cys, we investigated the distinctive features of muscle specimens of patients with FAP, 3 of who had Val30Met, 2 Ser50Ile, and 2 Tyr114Cys transthyretin. All specimens showed transthyretin amyloid around blood vessels and perimysium, and neurogenic denervation patterns. The amount of amyloid around the vessels was much greater in patients with FAP Ser50Ile and Tyr114Cys than in Val30Met patients. Muscular amyloid angiopathy may contribute to motor nerve injury that, in turn, may lead to amyotropic changes in patients with FAP Ser50Ile and Tyr114Cys.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlin is a protein of the sarcolemma that is mutated in patients with limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B, Miyoshi myopathy, and distal anterior myopathy. It has been implicated in muscle signaling and sarcolemma repair. To further understand its functional role we studied dysferlin expression in satellite cells (SCs) in normal and pathological human muscle biopsies, as well as in primary cultures of human skeletal muscle. Using immunohistochemistry we detected dysferlin-positive (Dysf+) SCs. Double staining with c-met+, a total SC marker, showed that the number of Dysf+ SCs ranged from 33.7% +/- 4.4% in normal muscle to 68.0% +/-6.2% in pathological muscles, whereas double staining with MyoD/Dysf showed that all activated SC (MyoD+) were also Dysf+. These results indicate that dysferlin is upregulated in activated SCs. In vitro, immunohistochemistry, semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and real-time PCR showed that both dysferlin mRNA and protein expression were higher in multinucleated myotubes than in the myoblast stage (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, experiments of inhibition of myoblast fusion with amiloride, a type T calcium channel antagonist, showed that dysferlin levels were lower in treated than in non-treated cultures (p &lt; 0.001), demonstrating that dysferlin expression reached peak levels upon differentiation into myotubes. These results and the in vivo findings of dysferlin expression when SCs are activated confirm the involvement of dysferlin in human muscle regeneration/repair and its possible role in fusion events during muscle development.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether patients in whom myositis develops after they receive silicone breast implants have distinct clinical, serologic, and/or immunogenetic features compared with patients with myositis who do not have silicone implants. METHODS: A preliminary case series study was followed by a larger, independent, matched case-control study to evaluate women in whom myositis developed after they received silicone implants (MASI patients) compared with healthy women with silicone implants and women with myositis but without silicone implants (idiopathic inflammatory myopathy; IIM patients). RESULTS: In a preliminary study, 11 MASI patients differed from 76 IIM patients in having an increased frequency of HLA-DQA1*0102 (odds ratio [OR] 9.8, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.77-96.79) and decreased frequencies of the myositis-associated risk factor DRB1*0301 (OR 0.1 [95% CI 0.002-0.63]) and its linked allele DQA1*0501 (OR 0.2 [95% CI 0.02-0.87]). A subsequent independent, matched case-control study revealed that although clinical features and autoantibodies did not differ significantly between the MASI and IIM groups, MASI patients again had decreased frequencies of DRB1*0301 (OR 0.2 [95% CI 0.07-0.72]) and DQA1*0501 (OR 0.2 [95% CI 0.08-0.84]) compared with IIM patients. Additional comparisons between MASI patients from both studies combined (n = 37) and a larger population of IIM patients (n = 453) suggested that HLA-DQA1*0102 may be uniquely associated with MASI (OR 2.6 [95% CI 1.25-5.46]). CONCLUSION: Women in whom inflammatory myopathy develops after they receive silicone implants constitute an immunogenetically distinct group of patients with myositis. These and other data suggest that autoimmune diseases as now defined may consist of multiple distinct entities, each of which is characterized by different genes and environmental exposures.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Several striated muscle myopathies have been directly linked to mutations in contractile and associated proteins. Troponin T (TnT) is one of the three subunits that form troponin (Tn) which together with tropomyosin is responsible for the regulation of striated muscle contraction. All three subunits of cardiac Tn as well as tropomyosin have been associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, TnT accounts for most of the mutations that cause HCM in these regulatory proteins. To date 30 mutations have been identified in the cardiac TnT (CTnT) gene that results in familial HCM (FHC). The CTnT gene has also been associated with familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). CTnT deficiency is lethal due to impaired cardiac development. A recessive nonsense mutation in the gene encoding slow skeletal TnT has been associated with an unusual, severe form of nemaline myopathy among the Old Order Amish. How each mutation leads to the diverse clinical symptoms associated with FHC, DCM or nemaline myopathy is unclear. However, the use of animal model systems, in particular transgenic mice, has significantly increased our knowledge of normal and myopathic muscle physiology. In this review, we focus on the role of TnT in muscle physiology and disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is associated with partial deletion of the subtelomeric D4Z4 repeat array on chromosome 4qter. This chromosomal rearrangement may result in regional chromatin relaxation and transcriptional deregulation of genes nearby. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here we describe the isolation and characterisation of FRG2, a member of a chromosomally dispersed gene family, mapping only 37 kb proximal to the D4Z4 repeat array. Homology and motif searches yielded no clues to the function of the predicted protein. FRG2 expression is undetectable in all tissues tested except for differentiating myoblasts of FSHD patients, which display low, yet distinct levels of FRG2 expression, partly from chromosome 4 but predominantly originating from its homologue on chromosome 10. However, in non-FSHD myopathy patients only distantly related FRG2 homologues are transcribed, while differentiating myoblasts from healthy controls fail to express any member of this gene family. Moreover, fibroblasts of FSHD patients and control individuals undergoing forced Ad5-MyoD mediated myogenesis show expression of FRG2 mainly originating from chromosome 10. Luciferase reporter assays show that the FRG2 promoter region can direct high levels of expression but is inhibited by increasing numbers of D4Z4 repeat units. Transient transfection experiments with FRG2 fusion-protein constructs reveal nuclear localisation and apparently FRG2 overexpression causes a wide range of morphological changes. CONCLUSION: The localisation of FRG2 genes close to the D4Z4 repeats on chromosome 4 and 10, their transcriptional upregulation specifically in FSHD myoblast cultures, potential involvement in myogenesis, and promoter properties qualify FRG2 as an attractive candidate for FSHD pathogenesis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Recent genetic and immunohistochemical analyses have shown that Miyoshi myopathy (MM) is caused by a mutation in the DYSF gene, which induces dysfunction of dysferlin. The author described one patient showing characteristic MM phenotype with deficiency of dysferlin on immunohistochemistry. Direct DNA sequencing of whole exons of DYSF gene revealed one homozygous missense mutation (G1165C) on exon 12, which let to an amino acid substitution from the glutamic acid to glutamine at the 389 of the peptide sequence in this patient. This is the first reported case of MM confirmed by immunohistochemical and genetic analyses in Korea.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A recently identified class of myopathies is produced by abnormal desmin, and is characterized by a disorganization of the desmin filament network, the accumulation of insoluble desmin-containing aggregates, and destructive changes in the sarcomeric organization of striated muscles. The desmin filaments interact with various other cytoskeletal proteins. The distinct clinical phenotypes are heterogeneous, with progressive skeletal myopathy, cardiomyopathy, and respiratory insufficiency as the most prominent features. Most of the desmin mutations are autosomal dominant. Identification of the causal genetic mutations shows that the desmin gene is not the only gene implicated in desminopathies; other genes encoding desmin-associated proteins, such as alpha-B-crystallin, and synemin may also be involved. Patients with mutations in their alpha-B-crystallin gene, which produce similar skeletal and cardiac myopathies, also have opaque lenses. Knockout mice have helped to reveal the fundamental role of desmin filaments in cell architecture, sarcomere alignment, myofibril organization, and the distribution of mitochondria. Transgenic mice, which accumulate aggregates of desmin and associated proteins in their muscles, show that the loss of desmin intermediate function as a result of mutations in desmin itself, or in the desmin-associated constituents, is important for disease progression.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To identify POLG mutations in patients with sensory ataxia and CNS features. METHODS: The authors characterized clinical, laboratory, and molecular genetic features in eight patients from five European families. The authors conducted sequencing of coding exons of POLG, C10orf2 (Twinkle), and ANT1 and analyzed muscle mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), including Southern blot analysis and long-range PCR. RESULTS: Ataxia occurred in combination with various CNS features, including myoclonus, epilepsy, cognitive decline, nystagmus, dysarthria, thalamic and cerebellar white matter lesions on MRI, and neuronal loss in discrete gray nuclei on autopsy. Gastrointestinal dysmotility, weight loss, cardiomyopathy, and valproate-induced hepatotoxicity occurred less frequently. Two patients died without preceding signs of progressive external ophthalmoplegia. In muscle, typical findings of mitochondrial disease, such as ragged red fibers and Southern blot mtDNA abnormalities, were absent. POLG mutations were present in eight patients, including two isolated cases, and one Finnish and two unrelated Belgian families contained in total six patients. All POLG mutations were recessive, occurring in a homozygous state in seven patients and in a compound heterozygous state in one patient. The novel W748S mutation was identified in five patients from three unrelated families. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical spectrum of recessive POLG mutations is expanded by sensory ataxic neuropathy, combined with variable features of involvement of CNS and other organs. Progressive external ophthalmoplegia, myopathy, ragged red fibers, and Southern blot abnormalities of muscle mitochondrial DNA also are not mandatory features associated with POLG mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Miyoshi distal myopathy (MM) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) were found to map to the same mutant gene encoding for dysferlin on chromosome 2p13. Most reported cases were large inbred kindreds whose members demonstrated both MM and LGMD2B phenotypes. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical, neurophysiological, histopathological, and genetic features in 4 patients with MM from 2 unrelated Chinese families demonstrating linkage to the dysferlin locus. RESULTS: All patients were characterized by early adult onset, preferential atrophy, and weakness of calf muscles, marked elevation of serum creatine kinase levels, and absence of dysferlin staining. Magnetic resonance imaging showed fatty and fibrotic tissue signals in the affected muscles. Genetic analysis revealed novel compound heterozygous mutations, 1310+1G to A and GGG to GTC transition at nucleotide 1650 (G426V ) in one family and another novel compound heterozygous mutation, a deletion of C at nucleotide 477 and a CCG to CTG transition at nucleotide 6576 (P2068L), in the other family. CONCLUSION: Miyoshi distal myopathy in these 2 Chinese families demonstrated a homogenous phenotype and compound heterozygous mutations. Among the 4 mutations, 3 were novel mutations that, to our knowledge, have not been reported previously.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the dysferlin gene (DYSF) on chromosome 2p13 cause distinct phenotypes of muscular dystrophy: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B), Miyoshi myopathy (MM), and distal anterior compartment myopathy, which are known by the term 'dysferlinopathy'. We performed mutation analyses of DYSF in 14 Italian patients from 10 unrelated families with a deficiency of dysferlin protein below 20% of the value in normal controls by immunoblotting analysis. We identified 11 different mutations, including eight missense and three deletion mutations. Nine of them were novel mutations. We also identified a unique 6-bp insertion polymorphism within the coding region of DYSF in 15% of Italian population, which was not observed in East Asian populations. The correlation between clinical phenotype and the gene mutations was unclear, which suggested the role of additional genetic and epigenetic factors in modifying clinical symptoms.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report three heterozygous missense mutations of the skeletal muscle alpha actin gene (ACTA1) in three unrelated cases of congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD) from Japan and Australia. This represents the first genetic cause of CFTD to be identified and confirms that CFTD is genetically heterogeneous. The three mutations we have identified Leucine221Proline, Aspartate292Valine, and Proline332Serine are novel. They have not been found previously in any cases of nemaline, actin, intranuclear rod, or rod-core myopathy caused by mutations in ACTA1. It remains unclear why these mutations cause type 1 fiber hypotrophy but no nemaline bodies. The three mutations all lie on one face of the actin monomer on the surface swept by tropomyosin during muscle activity, which may suggest a common pathological mechanism. All three CFTD cases with ACTA1 mutations had severe congenital weakness and respiratory failure without ophthalmoplegia. There were no clinical features specific to CFTD cases with ACTA1 mutations, but the presence of normal eye movements in a severe CFTD patient may be an important clue for the presence of a mutation in ACTA1.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mdx mouse, the animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, lacks dystrophin and develops an X-linked recessive inflammatory myopathy characterized by degeneration of skeletal muscle fibers and connective tissue replacement. The present work aimed to assess whether gender dimorphism in mdx mice would influence skeletal muscle pathology at ages corresponding to main histological changes in the microenvironment of muscular tissue: myonecrosis, regeneration, and fibrosis. At the height of myonecrosis (6 weeks postnatal), skeletal muscles of male mdx mice showed increased sarcolemmal permeability, numerous inflammatory foci, and marked deposition of the extracellular matrix components (ECM) type I collagen and laminin. In contrast, age-matched mdx females showed mild ECM deposition, discrete myonecrosis, but increased numbers of regenerating fibers expressing the satellite cell marker NCAM. In contrast ovariectomized mdx females showed decreased numbers of regenerating fibers. Older (24 and 48 weeks postnatal) mdx females showed extensive fibrosis with increased sarcolemmal permeability and marked deposition of ECM components than corresponding males. These results suggest a role for female hormones in the control of myonecrosis probably by promoting regeneration of muscular tissue and mitigating inflammation especially at ages under the critical influence of sex hormones.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Glycogen storage disease type IV (GSD-IV) is a clinically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder due to glycogen branching enzyme (GBE) deficiency and resulting in the accumulation of an amylopectin-like polysaccharide. The typical presentation is liver disease of childhood, progressing to lethal cirrhosis. The neuromuscular form of GSD-IV varies in onset (perinatal, congenital, juvenile, or adult) and severity. OBJECTIVE: To identify the molecular bases of different neuromuscular forms of GSD-IV and to establish possible genotype/phenotype correlations. METHODS: Eight patients with GBE deficiency had different neuromuscular presentations: three had fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS), three had congenital myopathy, one had juvenile myopathy, and one had combined myopathic and hepatic features. In all patients, the promoter and the entire coding region of the GBE gene at the RNA and genomic level were sequenced. RESULTS: Nine novel mutations were identified, including nonsense, missense, deletion, insertion, and splice-junction mutations. The three cases with FADS were homozygous, whereas all other cases were compound heterozygotes. CONCLUSIONS: This study expands the spectrum of mutations in the GBE gene and confirms that the neuromuscular presentation of GSD-IV is clinically and genetically heterogeneous.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle, manifested as a life-threatening hypermetabolic crisis after exposure to anesthetics. Type I ryanodine receptor 1 is the primary gene responsible for susceptibility to MH as well as central core disease, a congenital myopathy that predisposes susceptibility to MH. More than 40 mutations in the RyR1 gene cluster in three coding regions: the N-terminus, central, and C-terminus regions. However, the frequency of mutations in each region has not been studied in the North American MH-susceptible population. METHODS: The authors tested 124 unrelated patients with MH susceptibility for the presence of mutations in the N-terminus (exons 2, 6, 9, 11, 12, and 17), central (exons 39, 40, 44, 45, and 46), and C-terminus (exons 95, 100, 101, and 102) regions. RESULTS: Fourteen mutations have been identified in 29 of 124 MH-susceptible patients (23%). Approximately 70% of the mutations, which include a novel mutation, Ala 2437Val, were in the central region. In 8 patients (28%), mutations were identified in the N-terminus region. Screening the C-terminus region yielded a novel mutation, Leu4824Pro, in a single patient with a diagnosis of central core disease. CONCLUSIONS: The detection rate for mutations is only 23% by screening mutations (or exons) listed in the 2002 North American consensus panel. The implications from this study suggest that testing the central region first is currently the most effective screening strategy for the North American population. Screening more exons in the three hot spots may be needed to find an accurate frequency of mutations in the RyR1 gene.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A subset of patients harboring mutations in the dystrophin gene suffer from X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XLCM), a familial heart disease that is not accompanied by any clinical signs of skeletal muscle myopathy. As the muscle (M) isoform of dystrophin is not expressed in these patients, the absence of skeletal muscle symptoms has been attributed to expression of the brain (B) and cerebellar Purkinje (CP) isoforms of dystrophin in skeletal, but not cardiac, muscles of XLCM patients. The compensatory mechanism of dystrophin B and CP promoter upregulation is not known but it has been suggested that the dystrophin muscle enhancer from intron 1, DME-1, may be important in this activity. Previous studies have shown that the presence of the DME-1 is essential for a significant increase in dystrophin B and CP promoter activity in skeletal muscle cells in culture. Here, we demonstrate that the mouse dystrophin CP promoter drives expression of a lacZ reporter gene specifically to the cerebellar Purkinje cell layer but not to skeletal or cardiac muscle of transgenic mice. However, if the mouse counterpart of DME-1 is present in the transgene construct, the dystrophin CP promoter is now activated in skeletal muscle, but not in cardiac muscle. Our findings provide in vivo evidence for the importance of the dystrophin muscle enhancer sequences in activating the dystrophin CP promoter in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, they provide support for the model in which muscle enhancers, like DME-1, activate the dystrophin B and CP promoters in skeletal muscle, but not in cardiac muscle, of XLCM patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Uveal autoantigen with coiled coil domains and ankyrin repeats (UACA) is an autoantigen in patients with panuveitis such as Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease. The prevalence of IgG anti-UACA antibodies in patients with uveitis is significantly higher than healthy controls, suggesting its potential role as an autoantigen. Originally, UACA was cloned from dog thyroid tissue following TSH stimulation. So, we presumed UACA could be a novel autoantigen in autoimmune thyroid diseases. We measured serum anti-UACA antibody titer using ELISA in patients with autoimmune thyroid diseases (Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, subacute thyroiditis, and silent thyroiditis). The prevalence of anti-UACA antibodies in Graves' disease group was significantly higher than that in healthy group (15% vs. 0%). Moreover, the prevalence of anti-UACA antibodies in Graves' ophthalmopathy was significantly higher than that in Graves' patients without ophthalmopathy (29% vs. 11%). Especially, 75% of severe ocular myopathy cases showed high UACA titer. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that UACA protein is expressed in eye muscles as well as human thyroid follicular cells. Taken together, UACA is a novel candidate for eye muscle autoantigens in thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of HLA-DRB1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) promoter genotypes in the development and the autoantibody profiles of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) in Japanese patients. METHODS: HLA-DRB1 and TNF promoter genotypes were determined, and serum antinuclear autoantibodies were identified in 120 adult Japanese patients with IIM [72 with dermatomyositis (DM), 30 with polymyositis (PM), 18 with myositis overlapping with other collagen vascular diseases], as well as in 265 controls. RESULTS: Forty-two patients (35%) were positive for myositis-specific autoantibodies (MSA), including 37 (31%) for anti-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS) autoantibodies. Allele carrier frequency of HLA-DRB1*0803 was increased in the patients with IIM [p = 0.02, corrected p (pc) NS, 23% vs 14%, odds ratio (OR) = 1.9 (95% confidence interval, CI = 1.1-3.2)], with PM [p = 0.006, pc NS, 33%, OR 3.1 (95% CI 1.3-7.1)], and with anti-ARS autoantibodies [27%, p = 0.04, OR 2.3 (95% CI 1.0-5.1)] compared with controls. DRB1*0405 was increased in patients with anti-ARS autoantibodies compared with controls [41% vs 25%, p = 0.04, pc NS, OR 2.1 (95% CI 1.0-4.3)]. TNF promoter genotype was associated with the presence of interstitial lung disease (ILD). The carriage of a TNF-a haplotype formed by -1031C, -863A, and -857C was increased in the patients with ILD versus those without ILD [33% vs 18%, p = 0.05, pc NS, OR 2.3 (95% CI 0.94-5.5)]. CONCLUSION: HLA-DRB1 alleles were associated with development of IIM and MSA in a Japanese population.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathy has been associated with mutations in five different genes, which all encode protein components of the sarcomeric thin filaments. We report follow-up studies in two children with mutations not previously described in skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1). Case 1 was a male patient who after birth suffered from pronounced muscle weakness and hypotonia. Muscle biopsy showed small fibers with numerous rods. He failed to achieve any motor milestones. At the age of 17 he required 24 h ventilator support. He could not lift his arms against gravity, but he could use his hands to control his electric wheelchair. The muscle biopsy showed marked replacement of muscle tissue by fat and connective tissue. Only few fibers showed nemaline rods. He had a de novo, heterozygous mutation, G268D in ACTA1. Case 2 was a female patient with feeding difficulties and mild hypotonia in the neonatal period. Muscle biopsy showed hypoplastic muscle fibers and numerous rods. At 11 years of age she walked and moved unhindered and could run fairly well. She had a de novo, heterozygous mutation, K373E, in ACTA1. These two patients illustrate the marked variability in the clinical features of nemaline myopathy in spite of similar muscle pathology in early childhood. The severe muscle atrophy with replacement of fat and connective tissue in case 1 demonstrates the progressive nature of nemaline myopathy in some cases. The described two mutations add to the previously reported mutations in ACTA1 associated with nemaline myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We previously linked Laing-type early-onset autosomal dominant distal myopathy (MPD1) to a 22-cM region of chromosome 14. One candidate gene in the region, MYH7, which is mutated in cardiomyopathy and myosin storage myopathy, codes for the myosin heavy chain of type I skeletal muscle fibers and cardiac ventricles. We have identified five novel heterozygous mutations--Arg1500Pro, Lys1617del, Ala1663Pro, Leu1706Pro, and Lys1729del in exons 32, 34, 35, and 36 of MYH7--in six families with early-onset distal myopathy. All five mutations are predicted, by in silico analysis, to locally disrupt the ability of the myosin tail to form the coiled coil, which is its normal structure. These findings demonstrate that heterozygous mutations toward the 3' end of MYH7 cause Laing-type early-onset distal myopathy. MYH7 is the fourth distal-myopathy gene to have been identified.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlin plays an essential role in the muscle repair machinery, and its deficiency is associated with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and with two different distal myopathies (Miyoshi myopathy and distal anterior compartment myopathy). Our aims were to characterize the pattern of dysferlin expression during myogenic cell differentiation and to assess possible differentially spliced isoforms of the DYSF gene. Human primary myogenic cells express a splice variant of dysferlin mRNA lacking exon 17 (Delta17), together with full-length dysferlin mRNA. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of human myoblasts, myotubes, and normal skeletal muscle showed that Delta17 expression inversely correlates with muscle differentiation. Indeed, Delta17 is progressively replaced by the wild type as myoblast fusion proceeds, and it disappears in adult skeletal muscle. Conversely, Delta17 is the predominant dysferlin variant in mature peripheral nerve. Our findings suggest that the two proteins play different roles in myogenic cell differentiation and that dysferlin function in peripheral nerve might be accomplished by this novel isoform.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Abnormal expression of human myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (hDMPK) gene products has been implicated in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), yet the impact of distress accumulation produced by persistent overexpression of this poorly understood member of the Rho kinase-related protein kinase gene-family remains unknown. Here, in the aged transgenic murine line carrying approximately 25 extra copies of a complete hDMPK gene with all exons and an intact promoter region (Tg26-hDMPK), overexpression of mRNA and protein transgene products in cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscles resulted in deficient exercise endurance, an integrative index of muscle systems underperformance. In contrast to age-matched (11-15 months) wild-type controls, hearts from Tg26-hDMPK developed cardiomyopathic remodeling with myocardial hypertrophy, myocyte disarray and interstitial fibrosis. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was associated with a propensity for dysrhythmia and characterized by overt intracellular calcium overload promoting nuclear translocation of transcription factors responsible for maladaptive gene reprogramming. Skeletal muscles in distal limbs of Tg26-hDMPK showed myopathy with myotonic discharges coupled with deficit in sarcolemmal chloride channels, required regulators of hyperexcitability. Fiber degeneration in Tg26-hDMPK resulted in sarcomeric disorganization, centralization of nuclei and tubular aggregation. Moreover, the reduced blood pressure in Tg26-hDMPK indicated deficient arterial smooth muscle tone. Thus, the cumulative stress induced by permanent overexpression of hDMPK gene products translates into an increased risk for workload intolerance, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with dysrhythmia, myotonic myopathy and hypotension, all distinctive muscle traits of DM1. Proper expression of hDMPK is, therefore, mandatory in supporting the integral balance among cytoarchitectural infrastructure, ion-homeostasis and viability control in various muscle cell types.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>PROMM (proximal myotonic myopathy) and DM2 (myotonic dystrophy Type 2) are autosomal dominant multisystem disorders that have both been linked to chromosome 3q. Recently, the genetic basis of DM2 has been defined by a '(CCTG)(n)' expansion mutation in intron 1 of the ZNF9 gene. We identified and studied a multigenerational family in which five members had clinical features consistent with PROMM. Two affected members were available for detailed clinical, electrophysiological, radiological and genetic analysis. Our study confirms that the PROMM phenotype is associated with DM2-(CCTG)(n) expansion mutations. In addition, our results may extend the clinical spectrum of manifestations to include vestibular symptoms.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and Miyoshi myopathy are clinically distinct forms of muscular dystrophy that arise from defects in the dysferlin gene. Here, we report two novel lines of dysferlin-deficient mice obtained by (a) gene targeting and (b) identification of an inbred strain, A/J, bearing a retrotransposon insertion in the dysferlin gene. The mutations in these mice were located at the 3' and 5' ends of the dysferlin gene. Both lines of mice lacked dysferlin and developed a progressive muscular dystrophy with histopathological and ultrastructural features that closely resemble the human disease. Vital staining with Evans blue dye revealed loss of sarcolemmal integrity in both lines of mice, similar to that seen in mdx and caveolin-3 deficient mice. However, in contrast to the latter group of animals, the dysferlin-deficient mice have an intact dystrophin glycoprotein complex and normal levels of caveolin-3. Our findings indicate that muscle membrane disruption and myofiber degeneration in dysferlinopathy were directly mediated by the loss of dysferlin via a new pathogenic mechanism in muscular dystrophies. We also show that the mutation in the A/J mice arose between the late 1970s and the early 1980s, and had become fixed in the production breeding stocks. Therefore, all studies involving the A/J mice or mice derived from A/J, including recombinant inbred, recombinant congenic and chromosome substitution strains, should take into account the dysferlin defect in these strains. These new dysferlin-deficient mice should be useful for elucidating the pathogenic pathway in dysferlinopathy and for developing therapeutic strategies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathy (NM) is the most common of several congenital myopathies that present with skeletal muscle weakness and hypotonia. It is clinically heterogeneous and the diagnosis is confirmed by identification of nemaline bodies in affected muscles. The skeletal muscle alpha-actin gene (ACTA1) is one of five genes for thin filament proteins identified so far as responsible for different forms of NM. We have screened the ACTA1 gene in a cohort of 109 unrelated patients with NM. Here, we describe clinical and pathological features associated with 29 ACTA1 mutations found in 38 individuals from 28 families. Although ACTA1 mutations cause a remarkably heterogeneous range of phenotypes, they were preferentially associated with severe clinical presentations (p &lt; 0.0001). Most pathogenic ACTA1 mutations were missense changes with two instances of single base pair deletions. Most patients with ACTA1 mutations had no prior family history of neuromuscular disease (24/28). One severe case, caused by compound heterozygous recessive ACTA1 mutations, demonstrated increased alpha-cardiac actin expression, suggesting that cardiac actin might partially compensate for ACTA1 abnormalities in the fetal/neonatal period. This cohort also includes the first instance of an ACTA1 mutation manifesting with adult-onset disease and two pedigrees exhibiting potential incomplete penetrance. Overall, ACTA1 mutations are a common cause of NM, accounting for more than half of severe cases and 26% of all NM cases in this series.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the gene encoding alpha-skeletal-muscle actin, ACTA1, cause congenital myopathies of various phenotypes that have been studied since their discovery in 1999. Although much is now known about the clinical aspects of myopathies resulting from over 60 different ACTA1 mutations, we have very little evidence for how mutations alter the behavior of the actin protein and thus lead to disease. We used a combination of biochemical and cell biological analysis to classify 19 myopathy mutants and found a range of defects in the actin. Using in vitro expression systems, we probed actin folding and actin's capacity to interact with actin-binding proteins and polymerization. Only two mutants failed to fold; these represent recessive alleles, causing severe myopathy, indicating that patients produce nonfunctional actin. Four other mutants bound tightly to cyclase-associated protein, indicating a possible instability in the nucleotide-binding pocket, and formed rods and aggregates in cells. Eleven mutants showed defects in the ability to co-polymerize with wild-type actin. Some of these could incorporate into normal actin structures in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, but two of the three tested also formed aggregates. Four mutants showed no defect in vitro but two of these formed aggregates in cells, indicating functional defects that we have not yet tested for. Overall, we found a range of defects and behaviors of the mutants in vitro and in cultured cells, paralleling the complexity of actin-based muscle myopathy phenotypes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of the present report is to emphasize that the source of elevated transaminase levels, although usually indicative of hepatocellular damage, can also be of extrahepatic origin. CASE REPORT: A 42-year-old female presented with a moderate persistent elevation of the transaminases glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT; synonym: aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT; synonym: alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) in blood without any apparent clinical symptoms of liver affection. In the course of further diagnostics for clarification of a suspected liver disease, a markedly elevated activity of creatine kinase was found which, in concert with results from myography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and analysis of muscle biopsies, suggested the tentative diagnosis of a distal myopathy type Miyoshi. The diagnosis was confirmed by identification of the underlying mutation in the dysferlin gene. The course of the disease has been slowly but steadily progressive; there is no therapeutic option at present. The relevance of molecular genetic analyses in the diagnostic procedure for distal myopathies, in particular dysferlinopathy, is discussed and the characteristics of this disease are summarized. CONCLUSION: In the case of persistent elevations of the serum transaminases GOT and GPT without liver disorder, a myopathy has to be taken into account as a potential extrahepatic source. In order to avoid needless nondirected expensive investigations and to prevent a delay in diagnostics, activity of serum creatine kinase should be determined which is moderately to strongly elevated in the case of myopathies. If, in particular, a dysferlinopathy is supposed, the underlying mutation should be identified to confirm the diagnosis and as a basis for current and future therapeutic interventions</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We have studied a cohort of nemaline myopathy (NM) patients with mutations in the muscle alpha-skeletal actin gene (ACTA1). Immunoblot analysis of patient muscle demonstrates increased gamma-filamin, myotilin, desmin and alpha-actinin in many NM patients, consistent with accumulation of Z line-derived nemaline bodies. We demonstrate that nebulin can appear abnormal secondary to a primary defect in actin, and show by isoelectric focusing that mutant actin isoforms are present within insoluble actin filaments isolated from muscle from two ACTA1 NM patients. Transfection of C2C12 myoblasts with mutant actin(EGFP) constructs resulted in abnormal cytoplasmic and intranuclear actin aggregates. Intranuclear aggregates were observed with V163L-, V163M- and R183G-actin(EGFP) constructs, and modeling shows these residues to be adjacent to the nuclear export signal of actin. V163L and V163M actin mutants are known to cause intranuclear rod myopathy, however, intranuclear bodies were not reported in patient R183G. Transfection studies in C2C12 myoblasts showed significant alterations in the ability of V136L and R183G actin mutants to polymerize and contribute to insoluble actin filaments. Thus, we provide direct evidence for a dominant-negative effect of mutant actin in NM. In vitro studies suggest that abnormal folding, altered polymerization and aggregation of mutant actin isoforms are common properties of NM ACTA1 mutants. Some of these effects are mutation-specific, and likely result in variations in the severity of muscle weakness seen in individual patients. A combination of these effects contributes to the common pathological hallmarks of NM, namely intranuclear and cytoplasmic rod formation, accumulation of thin filaments and myofibrillar disorganization.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Several human genetic diseases that affect striated muscle have been modeled by creating knockout mouse strains. However, many of these are perinatal lethal mutations that result in death from respiratory distress within hours after birth. As the diaphragm muscle does not contract until birth, the sudden increase in diaphragm activity creates permanent injury to the muscle causing it to fail to meet respiratory demands. Therefore, the impact of these mutations remains hidden throughout embryonic development and early death prevents investigators from performing detailed studies of other striated muscle groups past the neonatal stage. Glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII), caused by a deficiency in acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), leads to lysosomal accumulation of glycogen in all cell types and abnormal myofibrillogenesis in striated muscle. Contractile function of the diaphragm muscle is severely affected in both infantile-onset and late-onset individuals, with death often resulting from respiratory failure. The knockout mouse model of GSDII survives well into adulthood despite the gradual weakening of all striated muscle groups. Using this model, we investigated the delivery of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors encoding the human GAA cDNA to the developing embryo. Results indicate specific high-level transduction of diaphragm tissue, leading to activity levels up to 10-fold higher than normal and restoration of normal contractile function. Up to an estimated 50 vector copies per diploid genome were quantified in treated diaphragms. Histological glycogen staining of treated diaphragms revealed prevention of lysosomal glycogen accumulation in almost all fibers when compared with untreated controls. This method could be employed with disease models where specific rescue of the diaphragm would allow for increased survival and thus further investigation into the impact of the gene deletion on other striated muscle groups.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: The term myofibrillar myopathy refers to a rare and clinically heterogeneous group of muscle disorders. The pathogenesis of this myopathy is not well understood. The morphologic hallmark is myofibrillar destruction with abnormal expression of numerous proteins, most consistently of desmin. METHODS: The authors investigated eight patients with myofibrillar myopathy belonging to four families. They studied the role of different protein kinase C isoforms and of interleukin-1beta, a cytokine that might activate protein kinase C and, in addition, mediate myofibrillar proteolysis. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis showed the expression of alpha, eta, and zeta isoforms of protein kinase C and of interleukin-1beta in abnormal muscle fibers. Immunoblots confirmed the immunohistochemical data and revealed the absence of protein kinase C delta and epsilon in muscle fibers from patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that protein kinase C and interleukin-1beta may play a role in the pathogenesis of myofibrillar myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The most common form of autosomal recessive (AR) hereditary inclusion-body myopathy (HIBM), originally described in Persian-Jewish families, is characterized by onset in early adult life with weakness and atrophy of distal lower limb muscles, which progress proximally and relatively spare the quadriceps. AR HIBM is associated with mutations in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase gene (GNE) on chromosome 9p12-13. In the present study we have identified seven novel GNE mutations in patients from five unrelated Italian families with clinical and pathologic features indicative of AR HIBM. Four were missense mutations (c.1556A>G [p.N519S], c.79C>T [p.P27S], c.1798G>A [p.A600T] and c.616G>A [p.G206S]), two consisted in a single-base deletion (c.616delG [p.G206fsX4] and c.1130delT [p.I377fsX16]) and one in an intronic single-base insertion (c.1070+2dupT). These latter findings further extend the type of GNE mutations associated with HIBM. Furthermore, in one patient we also identified the c.737G>A [p.R246Q] missense mutation that corresponds to the one previously reported in a family from the Bahamas. Interestingly, in two of our families distinct mutations affected nucleotide c.616 in exon 3 (c.616delG and c.616G>A). The possibility of specific portions of the gene being more prone to mutations remains to be elucidated.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To identify the gene and specific mutation underlying hyaline body myopathy in the family studied. METHODS: A microsatellite-based whole genome scan was performed. Linkage analysis assumed autosomal dominant inheritance and equal allele frequencies. A candidate gene approach within the linked interval and direct sequencing were used for mutation detection. RESULTS: Initial analysis indicated a maximum lod score of 3.01 at D14S1280. High-density mapping surrounding the linked locus was performed. Multipoint analysis showed that the linked region with a maximum lod score of 3.01 extended from D14S742 to D14S608 with a peak non-parametric linkage (NPL) score of 3.75 at D14S608. The myosin heavy chain genes MYH6 and MYH7 map to the region between D14S742 and D14S1280. Sequence analysis of the coding regions of MYH7 revealed an A-->T transversion at nucleotide position 25596 (M57965) resulting in a histidine-to-leucine amino acid change at residue 1904 (H1904L). CONCLUSION: Pathogenicity of the MYH7 H1904L mutation most likely results from disruption of myosin heavy chain assembly or stability of the sarcomeric protein. The MYH7 tail domain mutation results in an inclusion body myopathy with an apparent absence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy usually associated with mutations of this gene.</rdfs:comment>

Mutations in the desmin and the alpha-B crystallin genes account for approximately one third of the DRM cases. The genetic basis of the other forms remain unknown, including the early-onset, recessive form with Mallory body-like inclusions (MB-DRMs), first described in five related German patients. Recently, we identified the selenoprotein N gene (SEPN1) as responsible for SEPN-related myopathy (SEPN-RM), a unique early-onset myopathy formerly divided in two different nosological categories: rigid spine muscular dystrophy and the severe form of classical multiminicore disease. The finding of Mallory body-like inclusions in two cases of genetically documented SEPN-RM led us to suspect a relationship between MB-DRM and SEPN1. In the original MB-DRM German family, we demonstrated a linkage of the disease to the SEPN1 locus (1p36), and subsequently a homozygous SEPN1 deletion (del 92 nucleotide -19/+73) in the affected patients. A comparative reevaluation showed that MB-DRM and SEPN-RM share identical clinical features. Therefore, we propose that MB-DRM should be categorized as SEPN-RM. These findings substantiate the molecular heterogeneity of DRM, expand the morphological spectrum of SEPN-RM, and implicate a necessary reassessment of the nosological boundaries in early-onset myopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Miyoshi myopathy is characterized by weakness of the calf muscles during early adulthood. We report a case of late-onset Miyoshi myopathy presenting at 48 years of age, with novel mutations in the dysferlin gene. Muscle computed tomography clearly revealed severe atrophy in the soleus and medial gastrocnemius muscles. Even older patients with atrophy in the posterior compartment of the distal lower extremities and a relatively high serum creatine kinase level should be examined for the dysferlin gene.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The term myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) is a noncommittal term for a pathologic pattern of myofibrillar dissolution associated with accumulation of myofibrillar degradation products and ectopic expression of multiple proteins. Ultrastructural studies implicate the Z-disk as the site of the initial pathologic change, and mutations in two Z-disk-related proteins, desmin and alphaB-crystallin, have been identified in a minority of patients with MFM. The authors' objective was to determine whether mutations in myotilin, a key Z-disk component and the disease protein in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 1A, are another cause of MFM. METHODS: The authors used histochemical, immunocytochemical, ultrastructural, and mutation analysis. RESULTS: The authors detected four missense mutations in 6 of 57 patients with MFM in the serine-rich exon 2 of MYOT, where the two previously identified LGMD1A mutations are located. Three mutations were novel, and one had been previously identified in LGMD1A. Each patient had evidence for neuropathy, and at least three kinships had associated cardiomyopathy. Distal weakness greater than proximal weakness was present in three patients. Except for minor differences, the morphologic features were similar to those in other patients with MFM. CONCLUSIONS: 1) Mutations in myotilin cause MFM; 2) exon 2 of MYOT is a hotspot for mutations; 3) peripheral neuropathy, cardiomyopathy, and distal weakness greater than proximal weakness are part of the spectrum of myotilinopathy; 4) not all cases of myotilinopathy have a limb-girdle phenotype; and 5) the molecular basis of the majority of MFM cases remains to be discovered.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mitochondrial myopathy and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA) is a rare, autosomal recessive oxidative phosphorylation disorder specific to skeletal muscle and bone marrow. Linkage analysis and homozygosity testing of two families with MLASA localized the candidate region to 1.2 Mb on 12q24.33. Sequence analysis of each of the six known genes in this region, as well as four putative genes with expression in bone marrow or muscle, identified a homozygous missense mutation in the pseudouridine synthase 1 gene (PUS1) in all patients with MLASA from these families. The mutation is the only amino acid coding change in these 10 genes that is not a known polymorphism, and it is not found in 934 controls. The amino acid change affects a highly conserved amino acid, and appears to be in the catalytic center of the protein, PUS1p. PUS1 is widely expressed, and quantitative expression analysis of RNAs from liver, brain, heart, bone marrow, and skeletal muscle showed elevated levels of expression in skeletal muscle and brain. We propose deficient pseudouridylation of mitochondrial tRNAs as an etiology of MLASA. Identification of the pathophysiologic pathways of the mutation in these families may shed light on the tissue specificity of oxidative phosphorylation disorders.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Actinopathies are defined by missense mutations in the ACTA1 gene coding for sarcomeric actin, of which some 70 families have, so far, been identified. Often, but not always, muscle fibers carry large patches of actin filaments. Many such patients also have nemaline myopathy, qualifying actinopathies as a subgroup of nemaline myopathies. This article concerns a then newborn, now 2 1/2-year-old boy, the first and single child of nonconsanguineous parents, who was born floppy, requiring immediate postnatal assisted ventilation. A quadriceps muscle biopsy revealed large patches of thin myofilaments reacting at light and electron microscopic levels with antibodies against actin but only a few sarcoplasmic rods and no intranuclear rods. DNA analysis of the patient's and both parents' blood did not reveal any missense mutation in the ACTA1 gene. Thus, this congenital myopathy can be caused by a new type of ACTA1 gene mutation, a new non-ACTA1 gene mutation, or no mutation at all, designating it as an actin-related myopathy, perhaps a new type of congenital myopathy and a new member of protein aggregate myopathies marked by aggregation of proteins within muscle fibers, among them desminopathies, alpha-beta crystallinopathies, other desmin-related myopathies (also termed myofibrillar myopathies), actinopathies and, now, actin-related myopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Immunoglobulin mu binding protein 2 (IGHMBP2) is a DNA/RNA helicase with a putative role in transcriptional regulation and splicing. A recessive mutation of the Ighmbp2 gene in neuromuscular degeneration (nmd) mice causes progressive neurogenic atrophy of limb muscles. Affected mice show significant loss of motor neurons with large caliber axons and a moderate reduction of neurons with small caliber axons in the ventral nerve roots of the spinal cord. To investigate the role of Ighmbp2 in the pathogenesis of neuromuscular degeneration, we generated two independent lines of transgenic mice expressing the full-length Ighmbp2 cDNA specifically in neurons. Histopathological evaluation of L4 ventral nerve roots revealed that transgenic expression of the Ighmbp2 cDNA prevented primary motor neuron degeneration, while restoring the normal axonal morphology and density in nmd mice. A similar neuronal improvement is found in mutant mice carrying the CAST/EiJ-derived modifier of nmd (Mnm(C)). Intriguingly, both the transgenic and modified nmd mice went on to develop a previously unobserved cardiac and skeletal myopathy. Necropsy of nmd mice in end-stage heart failure revealed a primary dilated cardiomyopathy with secondary respiratory failure that was confirmed by in vivo ECG and echocardiographic measures. Our results suggest that reduced levels of IGHMBP2 in nmd mice compromise the integrity and function not only of motor neurons but also of skeletal and cardiac myocytes. These findings highlight the important role of IGHMBP2 in the maintenance and survival of these terminally differentiated cell types.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Deficiency of carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) is an autosomal recessive disorder of the carnitine cycle resulting in the inability to transfer fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Only a limited number of affected patients have been reported and the effect of therapy on this condition is still not well defined. Here, we report a new patient with this disorder and follow the response to therapy. Our patient was the product of a consanguineous marriage. He presented shortly after birth with cardiac myopathy and arrhythmia coupled with severe non-ketotic hypoglycemia. Initial metabolic studies indicated severe non-ketotic C6-C10 dicarboxylic aciduria, plasma carnitine deficiency, and a characteristic elevation of plasma C:16:0, C18:1, and C18:2 acylcarnitine species. Enzyme assay confirmed deficiency of CACT activity. Molecular studies indicated that this child was homozygous, and both parents heterozygous, for a single bp change converting glutamine 238 to arginine (Q238R). Therapy with a formula providing most of the fat via medium chain triglycerides (MCT) and carnitine supplementation reduced the concentration of long-chain acylcarnitines and reversed cardiac symptoms and the hypoglycemia. These results suggest that carnitine and MCT may be effective in treating this defect of long-chain fatty acid oxidation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The Myosin heavy chain (Mhc) locus encodes the muscle-specific motor mediating contraction in Drosophila. In a screen for temperature-sensitive behavioral mutants, we have identified two dominant Mhc alleles that lead to a hypercontraction-induced myopathy. These mutants are caused by single point mutations in the ATP binding/hydrolysis domain of Mhc and lead to degeneration of the flight muscles. Electrophysiological analysis in the adult giant fiber flight circuit demonstrates temperature-dependent seizure activity that requires neuronal input, as genetic blockage of neuronal activity suppresses the electrophysiological seizure defects. Intracellular recordings at the third instar neuromuscular junction show spontaneous muscle movements in the absence of neuronal stimulation and extracellular Ca2+, suggesting a dysregulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis within the muscle or an alteration of the Ca2+ dependence of contraction. Characterization of these new Mhc alleles suggests that hypercontraction occurs via a mechanism, which is molecularly distinct from mutants identified previously in troponin I and troponin T.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is a dominant progressive disorder that maps to chromosome 9p21.1-p12. We investigated 13 families with IBMPFD linked to chromosome 9 using a candidate-gene approach. We found six missense mutations in the gene encoding valosin-containing protein (VCP, a member of the AAA-ATPase superfamily) exclusively in all 61 affected individuals. Haplotype analysis indicated that descent from two founders in two separate North American kindreds accounted for IBMPFD in approximately 50% of affected families. VCP is associated with a variety of cellular activities, including cell cycle control, membrane fusion and the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway. Identification of VCP as causing IBMPFD has important implications for other inclusion-body diseases, including myopathies, dementias and Paget disease of bone (PDB), as it may define a new common pathological ubiquitin-based pathway.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: In humans with deficiency of the very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD), C14-C18 acylcarnitines accumulate. In this paper we have used the VLCAD knockout mouse as a model to study changes in blood carnitine and acylcarnitine profiles under stress. DESIGN: VLCAD knockout mice exhibit stress-induced hypoglycaemia and skeletal myopathy; symptoms resembling human VLCADD. To study the extent of biochemical derangement in response to different stressors, we determined blood carnitine and acylcarnitine profiles after exercise on a treadmill, fasting, or exposure to cold. RESULTS: Even in a nonstressed, well-fed state, knockout mice presented twofold higher C14-C18 acylcarnitines and a lower free carnitine of 72% as compared to wild-type littermates. After 1 h of intense exercise, the C14-C18 acylcarnitines in blood significantly increased, but free carnitine remained unchanged. After 8 h of fasting at 4 degrees C, the long-chain acylcarnitines were elevated 5-fold in knockout mice in comparison with concentrations in unstressed wild-type mice (P &lt; 0.05), and four out of 12 knockout mice died. Free carnitine decreased to 44% as compared with unstressed wild-type mice. An increase in C14-C18 acylcarnitines and a decrease of free carnitine were also observed in fasted heterozygous and wild-type mice. CONCLUSIONS: Long-chain acylcarnitines in blood increase in knockout mice in response to different stressors and concentrations correlate with the clinical condition. A decrease in blood free carnitine in response to severe stress is observed in knockout mice but also in wild-type littermates. Monitoring blood acylcarnitine profiles in response to different stressors may allow systematic analysis of therapeutic interventions in VLCAD knockout mice.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Slow-channel syndrome (SCS) is a progressive neuromuscular disorder caused by abnormal gating of mutant acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). The pathological hallmark is selective degeneration of the NMJ termed endplate myopathy. Endplate myopathy consists of a combination of ultrastructural abnormalities, including degenerating subsynaptic nuclei, mitochondria, and postsynaptic folds, caused by localized cation overload through mutant AChRs. Because some of these changes resemble those seen in programmed cell death, we evaluated SCS muscle for evidence of focal activation of apoptotic pathways. Using antisera specific for the activated forms of caspases, the family of cysteine proteases that underlies apoptosis, we demonstrated that active forms of initiator and effector caspases are selectively localized at the NMJ in SCS. In comparison with an electron microscopic assessment of the abnormalities seen in endplate myopathy, we found that activated caspases were present at between 15 and 57% of endplates, similar to the proportion of endplates with degenerating mitochondria or vacuoles. This greatly exceeds the number of NMJs exhibiting nuclear degeneration. These findings provide the first evidence supporting the view that caspase activation in human disease can play a prominent role in localized cellular degenerative processes without causing nuclear or cell death.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The caveolin-3 protein is expressed exclusively in muscle cells. Caveolin-3 expression is sufficient to form caveolae-sarcolemmal invaginations that are 50 to 100 nm in diameter. Monomers of caveolin-3 oligomerize to form high molecular mass scaffolding on the cytoplasmic surface of the sarcolemmal membrane. A mutation in one caveolin-3 allele produces an aberrant protein product capable of sequestering the normal caveolin-3 protein in the Golgi apparatus of skeletal muscle cells. Improper caveolin-3 oligomerization and membrane localization result in skeletal muscle T-tubule system derangement, sarcolemmal membrane alterations, and large subsarcolemmal vesicle formation. To date, there have been eight autosomal dominant caveolin-3 mutations identified in the human population. Caveolin-3 mutations can result in four distinct, sometimes overlapping, muscle disease phenotypes: limb girdle muscular dystrophy, rippling muscle disease, distal myopathy, and hyperCKemia. Thus, the caveolin-3 mutant genotype-to-phenotype relation represents a clear example of how genetic background can influence phenotypic outcome. This review examines in detail the reported cases of patients with caveolin-3 mutations and their corresponding muscle disease phenotypes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) is an adult onset neuromuscular disorder associated with mutations in the gene UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE), whose product is the rate limiting bi-functional enzyme catalyzing the first two steps of sialic acid biosynthesis. Loss of GNE activity in HIBM is thought to impair sialic acid production and interfere with proper sialylation of glycoconjugates, but it remains unclear how such a defect would lead to muscle destruction and muscle weakness. Hypoglycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, a central protein of the skeletal muscle dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, results in disturbed interactions with extracellular matrix proteins. This has recently been identified as the pathomechanism involved in several congenital muscular dystrophies. We examined the glycosylation status of alpha-dystroglycan in muscle biopsies of four HIBM patients of non-Iranian Jewish origin (one American, two Indians, and one Greek). Two of these patients carry novel compound heterozygous GNE mutations on exon 2 and exon 9. All four muscle biopsies showed absent or markedly reduced immunolabeling with two different antibodies (VIA4 and IIH6) to glycosylated epitopes of alpha-dystroglycan. Normal labeling was found using antibodies to the core alpha-dystroglycan protein, beta-dystroglycan, and laminin alpha-2. These findings resemble those found for other congenital muscular dystrophies, suggesting that HIBM may be a "dystroglycanopathy," and providing an explanation for the muscle weakness of patients with GNE mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The PRKAG3 gene encodes a muscle-specific isoform of the regulatory gamma subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). A major part of the coding PRKAG3 sequence was isolated from horse muscle cDNA using reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis. Horse-specific primers were used to amplify genomic fragments containing 12 exons. Comparative sequence analysis of horse, pig, mouse, human, Fugu, and zebrafish was performed to establish the exon/intron organization of horse PRKAG3 and to study the homology among different isoforms of AMPK gamma genes in vertebrates. The results showed conclusively that the three different isoforms (gamma1, gamma2, and gamma3) were established already in bony fishes. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), five causing amino acid substitutions, were identified in a screening across horse breeds with widely different phenotypes as regards muscle development and intended performance. The screening of a major part of the PRKAG3 coding sequence in a small case/control material of horses affected with polysaccharide storage myopathy did not reveal any mutation that was exclusively associated with this muscle storage disease. The breed comparison revealed several potentially interesting SNPs. One of these (Pro258Leu) occurs at a residue that is highly conserved among AMPK gamma genes. In an SNP screening, the variant allele was only found in horse breeds that can be classified as heavy (Belgian) or moderately heavy (North Swedish Trotter, Fjord, and Swedish Warmblood) but not in light horse breeds selected for speed or racing performance (Standardbred, Thoroughbred, and Quarter horse) or in ponies (Icelandic horses and Shetland pony). The results will facilitate future studies of the possible functional significance of PRKAG3 polymorphisms in horses.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Barth syndrome (BTHS) is a rare X-linked disease characterized by a triad of dilated cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, and neutropenia. The disease is associated with mutations of the TAZ gene, resulting in defective cardiolipin (CL), an important inner mitochondrial membrane component. Untreated boys die in infancy or early childhood from septicemia or cardiac failure. To date, neutrophil function has never been studied. Directed motility and killing activity of neutrophils was investigated in 7 BTHS patients and found normal in those tested. The circulating neutrophils and eosinophils (but not monocytes or lymphocytes) showed annexin-V binding, suggesting phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure due to apoptosis. However, caspase activity was absent in fresh BTHS cells. Unexpectedly, the near absence of CL impacted neither the mitochondrial mass and shape in fresh BTHS neutrophils nor mitochondrial clustering and Bax translocation upon apoptosis. Annexin-V binding to BTHS neutrophils was not caused by phospholipid scrambling. Moreover, freshly purified BTHS neutrophils were not phagocytosed by macrophages. In sum, a massive number of circulating annexin-V-binding neutrophils in the absence of apoptosis can be demonstrated in BTHS. These neutrophils expose an alternative substrate for annexin-V different from PS and not recognized by macrophages, excluding early clearance as an explanation for the neutropenia.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several muscle diseases. Semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO) metabolizes oxidative deamination of primary aromatic and aliphatic amines. In the oxidative reactions, amine substrates are converted into the aldehyde, followed by the production of ammonia and H(2)O(2). Although normal levels in muscle are very low, SSAO is expressed in almost all mammalian tissues. In this study, we examined the possible implication of SSAO as an additional source of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of muscle disorders. The expression of SSAO was examined immunohistochemically in muscle biopsy specimens from patients with inclusion-body myositis (IBM; n = 5), desmin-related myopathy (DRM; n = 3), dermatomyositis (n = 3), granulomatous (sarcoid) myopathy (n = 2), muscle denervation-reinnervation (n = 3), and rhabdomyolysis (n = 2), as well as from control subjects (n = 3). Strong SSAO immunoreactivity was present in vacuolated and nonvacuolated fibers in IBM, in abnormal fibers in DRM, and in degenerating and regenerating fibers in dermatomyositis and rhabdomyolysis. In addition, SSAO overexpression was observed in muscle fibers adjacent to granulomas in sarcoid myopathy. These results suggest that SSAO is a source of oxidative stress in diseased human skeletal muscle and that it contributes to oxidative stress-induced damage in various inflammatory and other myopathies. Alternatively, the expression of SSAO in muscle fibers may be a consequence of muscle fiber injury.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlin is a plasma membrane protein of skeletal muscle whose deficiency causes Miyoshi myopathy, limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B and distal anterior compartment myopathy. Recent studies have reported that dysferlin is implicated in membrane repair mechanism and coimmunoprecipitates with caveolin 3 in human skeletal muscle. Caveolin 3 is a principal structural protein of caveolae membrane domains in striated muscle cells and cardiac myocytes. Mutations of caveolin 3 gene (CAV3) cause different diseases and where caveolin 3 expression is defective, dysferlin localization is abnormal. We describe the alteration of dysferlin expression and localization in skeletal muscle from a patient with raised serum creatine kinase (hyperCKaemia), whose reduction of caveolin 3 is caused by a CAV3 P28L mutation. Moreover, we performed a study on dysferlin interaction with caveolin 3 in C2C12 cells. We show the association of dysferlin to cellular membrane of C2C12 myotubes and the low affinity link between dysferlin and caveolin 3 by immunoprecipitation techniques. We also reproduced caveolinopathy conditions in C2C12 cells by a selective p38 MAP kinase inhibition with SB203580, which blocks the expression of caveolin 3. In this model, myoblasts do not fuse into myotubes and we found that dysferlin expression is reduced. These results underline the importance of dysferlin-caveolin 3 relationship for skeletal muscle integrity and propose a cellular model to clarify the dysferlin alteration mechanisms in caveolinopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Chronic alcohol consumption decreases the concentration of the anabolic hormone IGF-I, and this change is associated with impaired muscle protein synthesis. The present study evaluated the ability of IGF-I complexed with IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-3 to modulate the alcohol-induced inhibition of muscle protein synthesis in gastrocnemius. After 16 wk on an alcohol-containing diet, either the IGF-I/IGFBP-3 binary complex (BC) or saline was injected two times daily for three consecutive days. After the final injection of BC (3 h), plasma IGF-I concentrations were elevated in alcohol-fed rats to values not different from those of similarly treated control animals. Alcohol feeding decreased the basal rate of muscle protein synthesis by limiting translational efficiency. BC treatment of alcohol-fed rats increased protein synthesis back to basal control values, but the rate remained lower than that of BC-injected control rats. The BC partially reversed the alcohol-induced decrease in the binding of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)4E with eIF4G. This change was associated with reversal of the alcohol-induced dephosphorylation of eIF4G but was independent of changes in the phosphorylation of either 4E-BP1 or eIF4E. However, BC reversed the alcohol-induced increase in IGFBP-1 and muscle myostatin, known negative regulators of IGF-I action and muscle mass. Hence, exogenous IGF-I, administered as part of a BC to increase its circulating half-life, can in part reverse the decreased protein synthesis observed in muscle from chronic alcohol-fed rats by stimulating selected components of translation initiation. The data support the role of IGF-I as a mediator of chronic alcohol myopathy in rats.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Desmin myopathy is a recently identified disease associated with mutations in desmin or alphaB-crystallin. Typically, the illness presents with lower limb muscle weakness slowly spreading to involve truncal, neck-flexor, facial, bulbar and respiratory muscles. Skeletal myopathy is often combined with cardiomyopathy manifested by conduction blocks and arrhythmias resulting in premature sudden death. Sections of the affected skeletal and cardiac muscles show abnormal fibre areas containing amorphous eosinophilic deposits seen as granular or granulofilamentous material on electron microscopic examination. Immuno-staining for desmin is positive in each region containing abnormal structures. The inheritance pattern in familial desmin myopathy is autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive, but many cases have no family history. At least some, and probably most, non-familial desmin myopathy cases are associated with de novo desmin mutations. Age of disease onset and rate of progression may vary depending on the type of inheritance and location of the causative mutation. Multiple mutations have been identified in the desmin gene: point substitutions, insertion, small in-frame deletions and a larger exon-skipping deletion. The majority of these mutations are located in conserved alpha-helical segments of desmin. Many of the missense mutations result in changing the original amino acid into proline, which is known as a helix breaker. Studies of transfected cell cultures indicate that mutant desmin is assembly-incompetent and able to disrupt a pre-existing filamentous network in dominant-negative fashion. Disease-associated desmin mutations in humans or transgenic mice cause accumulation of chimeric intracellular aggregates containing desmin and other cytoskeletal proteins. alphaB-crystallin serves in the muscle as a chaperone preventing desmin aggregation under various forms of stress. If mutated, alphaB-crystallin may cause a myopathy similar to those resulting from desmin mutations. Routine genetic testing of patients for mutations in desmin and alphaB-crystallin genes is now available and necessary for establishing an accurate diagnosis and providing appropriate genetic counselling. Better understanding of disease pathogenesis would stimulate research focused on developing specific treatments for these conditions.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotubularin and related proteins constitute a large and highly conserved family possessing phosphoinositide 3-phosphatase activity, although not all members possess this activity. This family contains a conserved region called the GRAM domain that is found in a variety of proteins associated with membrane-coupled processes and signal transduction. Mutations of myotubularin are found in X-linked myotubular myopathy, a severe muscle disease. Mutations in the GRAM domain are responsible for this condition, suggesting crucial roles for this region. Here, we show that the GRAM domain of myotubularin binds to phosphoinositide with the highest affinity to phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P(2)). In patients with myotubular myopathy, mutations in the myotubularin GRAM domain eliminate this binding, indicating that the PtdIns(3,5)P(2) binding ability of the GRAM (glucosyltransferases, Rablike GTPase activators and myotubularin) domain is crucial for the functions of myotubularin in vivo. Stimulation of epidermal growth factor recruits myotubularin to the late endosomal compartment in a manner dependent on the phosphoinositide binding. Overexpression of myotubularin inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor trafficking from late endosome to lysosome and induces the large endosomal vacuoles. Thus, our data suggest that myotubularin phosphatase physiologically functions in late endosomal trafficking and vacuolar morphology through interaction with PtdIns(3,5)P(2).</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The term myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) was proposed in 1996 as a non-committal term for a pathological pattern of myofibrillar dissolution associated with accumulation of myofibrillar degradation products and ectopic expression of multiple proteins that include desmin, alphaB-crystallin (alphaBC), dystrophin and congophilic amyloid material. Subsequent studies revealed dominant mutations in desmin and alphaBC in some MFM patients, and clinical differences between kinships. We here review the clinical, structural and genetic features of 63 unrelated patients diagnosed as having MFM at the Mayo Clinic between 1977 and 2003. The age of onset was 54 +/- 16 years (mean +/-SD). Weakness was both proximal and distal in 77% and proximal only in 13%. Cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in 16%. Electro myography revealed a myopathic pattern associated with abnormal electrical irritability; 13 patients had abnormal nerve conduction studies but four of these had long-standing diabetes. The abnormal muscle fibres are best identified in trichrome-stained sections as harbouring amorphous, granular or pleomorphic hyaline structures, and vacuoles containing membranous material. The hyaline structures are strongly congophilic. Semiquantitative analysis in each case indicates that among the abnormal fibres, an average of 90, 75, 75, 70 and 70% abnormally express myotilin, desmin, alphaBC, dystrophin and beta-amyloid precursor protein, respectively. Therefore, immunostains for these proteins, and especially for myotilin, are useful adjuncts in the diagnosis of MFM. Electron microscopy shows progressive myofibrillar degeneration commencing at the Z-disk, accumulation of degraded filamentous material and entrapment of dislocated membranous organelles in autophagic vacuoles. In all patients, we searched for mutations in desmin and alphaBC, as well as in telethonin, a Z-disk-associated protein, or in syncoilin, which together with plectin links desmin to the Z-disk. Two of the 63 patients carry truncation mutations in the C-terminal domain of alphaBC, four carry missense mutations in the head or tail region of desmin, and none carries a mutation in syncoilin or telethonin. Thus, MFM is morphologically distinct but genetically heterogeneous. Further advances in defining the molecular causes of MFM will probably come from linkage studies of informative kinships or from systematic search for mutations in proteins participating in the intricate network supporting the Z-disk.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles is an autosomal recessive muscle disease with preferential involvement of the tibialis anterior that spares the quadriceps muscles in young adulthood. In a Japanese patient with distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles, we identified pathogenic mutations in the gene encoding the bifunctional enzyme UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase, which catalyzes the initial two steps in the biosynthesis of sialic acid. In this study, we demonstrated the relationship between the genetic mutations and enzymatic activities using an in vitro expression assay system. Furthermore, we also showed that the levels of sialic acid in muscle and primary cultured cells from DMRV patients were reduced to 60-75% of control. The reactivities to lectins were also variable in some myofibers, suggesting that hyposialylation and abnormal glycosylation in muscles may contribute to the focal accumulations of autophagic vacuoles, amyloid deposits, or both in patient muscle tissue. The addition of ManNAc and NeuAc to primary cultured cells normalized sialylation levels, thus demonstrating the therapeutic potential of these compounds for this disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotubularin-related proteins are a large subfamily of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that dephosphorylate D3-phosphorylated inositol lipids. Mutations in members of the myotubularin family cause the human neuromuscular disorders myotubular myopathy and type 4B Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome. The crystal structure of a representative member of this family, MTMR2, reveals a phosphatase domain that is structurally unique among PTPs. A series of mutants are described that exhibit altered enzymatic activity and provide insight into the specificity of myotubularin phosphatases toward phosphoinositide substrates. The structure also reveals that the GRAM domain, found in myotubularin family phosphatases and predicted to occur in approximately 180 proteins, is part of a larger motif with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain fold. Finally, the MTMR2 structure will serve as a model for other members of the myotubularin family and provide a framework for understanding the mechanism whereby mutations in these proteins lead to disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We here report the second and third mutations in alphaB-crystallin causing myofibrillar myopathy. Two patients had adult-onset muscle weakness. Patient 1 had cervical, limb girdle, and respiratory muscle weakness and died of respiratory failure. Patient 2 had proximal and distal leg muscle weakness. Both had myopathic electromyogram with abnormal electrical irritability and muscle biopsy findings of myofibrillar myopathy and mild denervation. Myofibrillar disintegration begins at the Z-disk and results in abnormal local expression of desmin, alphaB-crystallin, dystrophin, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), and CDC2 kinase. Seven to 8% of nuclei display early apoptotic changes. Both patients carry a truncating mutation in the C-terminal region of alphaB-crystallin (464delCT in Patient 1 and Q151X in Patient 2) which is crucial for the solubilization and chaperone functions of the molecule. cDNA analysis shows the same mutations and no alternatively spliced transcripts. Immunoblots of muscle demonstrate increased expression of wild-type and reduced expression of the mutant protein. Immunoblots under nondenaturing conditions show that the mutant protein forms lower than normal molecular weight multimeric complexes with wild type. We conclude that (1) despite its reduced expression, the mutant protein exerts a dominant negative effect; (2) mutations in alphaB-crystallin are an infrequent cause of myofibrillar myopathy; (3) alphaB-crystallin-related myopathies display phenotypic heterogeneity.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlin, the protein product of the dysferlin gene (DYSF), has been shown to have a role in calcium-induced membrane fusion and repair. Dysferlin is absent or drastically reduced in patients with the following autosomal recessive disorders: limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD-2B), Miyoshi myopathy (MM) and distal anterior compartment myopathy. To date, less than 45 mutations have been described in DYSF and a wide inter- and intra-familial variation in clinical phenotype has been associated with the same mutation. This observation underlines the relevance of any new report describing genotype/phenotype correlations in dysferlinopathic patient and families. Here we present the results of clinical, biochemical and genetic analysis performed on one MM and three LGMD Italian families. By screening the entire coding region of DYSF, we identified three novel mutations (two missense substitutions and one frame shift microdeletion). The possible existence of a founder effect for the Arg959Trp mutation in the Italian population is discussed.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Riboflavin-responsive, multiple acylcoenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (RR-MAD), a lipid storage myopathy, is characterized by, among others, a decrease in fatty acid (FA) beta-oxidation capacity. Muscle uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) is up-regulated under conditions that either increase the levels of circulating free FA and/or decrease FA beta-oxidation. Using a relatively large cohort of seven RR-MAD patients, we aimed to better characterize the metabolic disturbances of this disease and to explore the possibility that it might increase UCP3 expression. A battery of biochemical and molecular tests were performed, which demonstrated decreases in FA beta-oxidation and in the activities of respiratory chain complexes I and II. These metabolic alterations were associated with increases of 3.1- and 1.7-fold in UCP3 mRNA and protein expression, respectively. All parameters were restored to control values after riboflavin treatment. We postulate that the up-regulation of UCP3 in RR-MAD is due to the accumulation of muscle FA/acylCoA. RR-MAD is an optimal model to support the hypothesis that UCP3 is involved in the outward translocation of an excess of FA from the mitochondria and to show that, in humans, the effects of FA on UCP3 expression are direct and independent of fatty acid beta-oxidation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Central core disease (CCD) is a dominantly inherited congenital myopathy allelic to malignant hyperthermia (MH) caused by mutations in the RYR1 gene on chromosome 19q13.1. Eleven individuals with RYR1 mutations are described. Four index cases showed features consistent with a congenital myopathy (hypotonia, delayed motor milestones, and skeletal abnormalities including congenital hip dislocation and scoliosis). All four cases and subsequently seven other family members were found to possess novel mutations in the RYR1 gene. The degree of disability varied from one clinically normal individual, to another who had never achieved independent ambulation (the only patient with a de novo mutation). Four cases showed a mild reduction in vital capacity, repeated nocturnal polysomnography showed hypoxaemia in one case. A variety of muscle biopsy features were found; central cores were absent in the youngest case, and the biopsy specimens from two others were more suggestive of mini-core myopathy. In all cases missense mutations in exons 101, 102, and 103 of the RYR1 gene on were found. Future laboratory diagnosis of suspected cases and family members will be less invasive and more accurate with DNA analysis. Clinicians, especially paediatricians and orthopaedic surgeons, should be aware of this disorder because of the potential risk of MH.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Caveolin-3 is the muscle-specific protein product of the caveolin gene family and an integral membrane component of caveolae. Mutations in the gene encoding caveolin-3 (CAV3) underlie four distinct disorders of skeletal muscle: the autosomal dominant form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 1C (LGMD-1C), rippling muscle disease (RMD), sporadic and familial forms of hyperCKemia, and distal myopathy. OBJECTIVE: To characterize a multigenerational Italian family affected by an autosomal dominant myopathic disorder and to assess the expression of caveolin-3, dystrophin, dystrophin-associated glycoproteins, and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in the myocardium of an affected patient. METHODS: Clinical analysis involved 15 family members. Skeletal muscle expression of sarcolemmal proteins was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis in three affected individuals. Caveolar structures were analyzed through electron microscopy in muscle biopsies and in one heart biopsy. RESULTS: CAV3 genetic analysis showed a heterozygous 3-bp microdeletion (328-330del) in affected individuals, resulting in the loss of a phenylalanine (Phe97del) in the transmembrane domain. In the skeletal muscle, the mutation was associated with severe caveolin-3 deficiency and caveolar disorganization, whereas the expression of the other analyzed muscle proteins was unaltered. Remarkably, caveolin-3 was expressed in myocardium at a level corresponding to about 60% of that of control individuals and was correctly localized at the myocardial cell membranes, with preservation of cardiac myofiber caveolar structures. Clinical analysis revealed the concomitant presence in this family of the following phenotypes: RMD, LGMD, and hyperCKemia. CONCLUSIONS: Intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity is associated with caveolin-3 Phe97 microdeletion. The molecular network interacting with caveolin-3 in skeletal muscle and heart may differ.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>MTM1, the gene encoding myotubularin (MTM1), is mutated in the X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a severe genetic muscular disorder. MTM1 is a phosphoinositide phosphatase hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) in yeast and in vitro. Because this lipid is implicated in the regulation of vesicular trafficking, we used established cell lines from XLMTM patients to evaluate whether the lack of endogenous MTM1 expression could affect PtdIns(3)P labeling patterns. Our results showed that the vesicular trafficking related to early endosomes was not significantly affected in the XLMTM cell lines compared with control cells. However, in addition to PtdIns(3)P, we found that MTM1 can hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate both in vitro and in mammalian cells. Using a mass assay, we demonstrated that the product generated is phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate (PtdIns(5)P), a recently discovered phosphoinositide, the function of which is still unknown. In L6 myotubes overexpressing MTM1, hyperosmotic shock induced an increase in the mass level of PtdIns(5)P that was reduced by 50% upon overexpression of the MTM1 inactive mutant D278A. These data demonstrate for the first time a role for MTM1 in the production of PtdIns(5)P in mammalian cells, suggesting that the lack of transformation of phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate into PtdIns(5)P might be an important component in the etiology of myotubular myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In eukaryotic cells, the acyl species of the phospholipid cardiolipin (CL) are more highly unsaturated than those of the other membrane phospholipids. Defective acylation of CL with unsaturated fatty acids and decreased total CL are associated with Barth syndrome, an X-linked cardio- and skeletal myopathy attributed to a defect in the gene G4.5 (also known as tafazzin). We constructed a yeast mutant (taz1) containing a null mutation in the homologue of the human G4.5 gene. The yeast taz1Delta mutant was temperature sensitive for growth in ethanol as sole carbon source, but grew normally on glucose or glycerol plus ethanol. Total CL content was reduced in the taz1Delta mutant, and monolyso-CL accumulated. The predominant CL acyl species found in wild-type cells, C18:1 and C16:1, were markedly reduced in the mutant, whereas CL molecules containing saturated fatty acids were present. Interestingly, CL synthesis increased in the mutant, whereas expression of the CL structural genes CRD1 and PGS1 did not, suggesting that de novo biosynthetic enzyme activities are regulated by CL acylation. These results indicate that the taz1Delta mutant is an excellent genetic tool for the study of CL remodelling and may serve as a model system for the study of Barth syndrome.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Desmin ( DES) mutations have been recognized as a cause of desmin-related myopathy (OMIM 601419), or desminopathy, a disease characterized by progressive limb muscle weakness and accumulation of desmin-reactive granular aggregates in the myofibers. We have studied three families with skeletal or cardioskeletal myopathy caused by small in-frame deletions in the desmin gene. The newly identified in-frame deletions E359_S361del and N366del alter the heptad periodicity within a critical 2B coiled-coil segment. Structural analysis reveals that the E359_S361 deletion introduces a second stutter immediately downstream of the naturally occurring stutter, thus doubling the extent of the local coiled-coil unwinding. The N366del mutation converts the wild-type stutter into a different type of discontinuity, a stammer. A stammer, as opposed to a stutter, is expected to cause an extra overwinding of the coiled-coil. These mutations alter the coiled-coil geometry in specific ways leading to fatal damage to desmin filament assembly. Expression studies in two cell lines confirm the inability of desmin molecules with this changed architecture to polymerize into a functional filamentous network. This study provides insights into molecular pathogenetic mechanisms of desmin mutation-associated skeletal and cardioskeletal myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) is characterised by progressive weakness of proximal and distal limb muscles. Most patients are aged over 50 years at disease onset. Muscle biopsy reveals an inflammatory myopathy and cytoplasmic amyloid deposits. The mononuclear infiltrate is dominated by CD8+ T-cells. Several investigators have described associations between s-IBM and certain HLA antigens and alleles. However, to date neither HLA class I nor II alleles have been analysed in a large series of patients. We typed various HLA class I and II alleles in 47 patients suffering from s-IBM using sequence specific-primer pairs (SSPPCR). The results were compared with published German controls. Additional Bonferroni adjustment was performed over all allele groups corresponding to serologically defined antigens within one HLA class I or II locus. After Bonferroni adjustment, we found a significant increase in frequency of the following HLA alleles for s-IBM patients when compared with normal controls: A*03 (p = 0.0002), B*08 (p = 0.002), DRB1*03 (p = 0.0000002), and DQB1*05 (p = 0.02). HLA typing may be helpful to distinguish between subgroups of s-IBM patients. Moreover, HLA analysis may aid in identifying patients who might profit from future therapeutic strategies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The accumulation of multiple mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions in stable tissues is a distinctive feature of several autosomal disorders, characterized by Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia (PEO), ptosis, and proximal myopathy. At least three nuclear genes are responsible for these disorders: ANT1 and C10orf2 cause autosomal dominant PEO, while mutations of DNA polymerase gammaA (POLG1 or POLG) gene on chromosome 15q25 causes both autosomal dominant and recessive forms of PEO. To investigate the contribution of these genes to the sporadic cases of PEO with multiple mtDNA deletions, we studied 31 mitochondrial myopathy patients without any family history for the disorder: 23 had PEO with myopathy, with or without the additional features of pigmentary retinopathy, ataxia, neurosensorial hypoacusia and diabetes mellitus, 7 presented isolated myopathy and one a peripheral neuropathy with ptosis. In all patients Southern blot of muscle DNA showed multiple mtDNA deletions; screening for ANT1 and C10ORF2 genes was negative. POLG analysis revealed mutations in eight patients; in six of them the mutations were allelic, while two patients were heterozygous. Five mutations were new, namely one stop codon (c.2407C>T/p.R709X) and four missense mutations (c.1085G>C/p.G268A; c.1967G>A/p.R562Q; c.2702G>C/p.R807P; c.3076C>T/p.H932W). A high degree of conservation was observed for all the new missense mutations. Only patients presenting PEO as part of their clinical phenotype had POLG mutations, in seven of them together with myopathic signs and in one with a sensori-motor peripheral neuropathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Previous co-immunoprecipitation studies have shown that endogenous PFK-M (phosphofructokinase, muscle-specific isoform) associates with caveolin (Cav)-3 under certain metabolic conditions. However, it remains unknown whether Cav-3 expression is required for the plasma membrane recruitment and caveolar targeting of PFK-M. Here, we demonstrate that recombinant expression of Cav-3 dramatically affects the subcellular localization of PFK-M, by targeting PFK-M to the plasma membrane, and by trans-locating PFK-M to caveolae-enriched membrane domains. In addition, we show that the membrane recruitment and caveolar targeting of PFK-M appears to be strictly dependent on the concentration of extracellular glucose. Interestingly, recombinant expression of PFK-M with three Cav-3 mutants [DeltaTFT (63 to 65), P104L, and R26Q], which harbor the same mutations as seen in the human patients with Cav-3-related muscle diseases, causes a substantial reduction in PFK-M expression levels, and impedes the membrane recruitment of PFK-M. Analysis of skeletal muscle tissue samples from Cav-3(-/-) mice directly demonstrates that Cav-3 expression regulates the phenotypic behavior of PFK-M. More specifically, in Cav-3-null mice, PFK-M is no longer targeted to the plasma membrane, and is excluded from caveolar membrane domains. As such, our current results may be important in understanding the pathogenesis of Cav-3-related muscle diseases, such as limb-girdle muscular dystrophy-1C, distal myopathy, and rippling muscle disease, that are caused by mutations within the human Cav-3 gene.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Collagen VI is an extracellular matrix protein that forms a microfilamentous network in skeletal muscles and other organs. Inherited mutations in genes encoding collagen VI in humans cause two muscle diseases, Bethlem myopathy and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy. We previously generated collagen VI-deficient (Col6a1-/-) mice and showed that they have a muscle phenotype that strongly resembles Bethlem myopathy. The pathophysiological defects and mechanisms leading to the myopathic disorder were not known. Here we show that Col6a1-/-muscles have a loss of contractile strength associated with ultrastructural alterations of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and mitochondria and spontaneous apoptosis. We found a latent mitochondrial dysfunction in myofibers of Col6a1-/-mice on incubation with the selective F1F(O)-ATPase inhibitor oligomycin, which caused mitochondrial depolarization, Ca2+ deregulation and increased apoptosis. These defects were reversible, as they could be normalized by plating Col6a1-/-myofibers on collagen VI or by addition of cyclosporin A (CsA), the inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). Treatment of Col6a1-/-mice with CsA rescued the muscle ultrastructural defects and markedly decreased the number of apoptotic nuclei in vivo. These findings indicate that collagen VI myopathies have an unexpected mitochondrial pathogenesis that could be exploited for therapeutic intervention.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Muscular dysgenesis (mdg) in the mouse is a loss-of-function mutation of the skeletal muscle isoform of the voltage-sensor Ca2+ channel of skeletal muscle (DHP receptor alpha1 subunit, Cchl1a3, Chr1), which is essential for excitation-contraction coupling. Affected individuals (genotype mdg/mdg, phenotype MDG) are unable to breathe and die perinatally. We introduce here extraocular muscles in the study of MDG myopathy and show that, despite their developmental origin from head placodes, they are affected like trunk and limb muscles. MDG myotubes in situ are eliminated by necrosis, not apoptosis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Administration of glucocorticoids results in hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and general myopathy. The present study analyzed the acute effect of dexamethasone (0.5 mg/100 g for 3 days) or dexamethasone plus insulin-like growth factor-1 (0.35 mg/100 g for 3 days) on differential gene expression in the gastrocnemius muscle and the left ventricular myocardium of rats. Dexamethasone induced atrophy of gastrocnemius muscle. Cathepsin L, and not ubiquitin, was the earliest mediator of skeletal muscle proteolysis induced by dexamethasone. Insulin-like growth factor-1 reversed gastrocnemius muscle mass, and deleted a part of downregulated genes by dexamethasone. On the other hand, dexamethasone administration did not result in cardiac hypertrophy or hypertension. Only prostaglandin D synthase gene was upregulated by dexamethasone in myocardium, and genes related to extracellular matrix and proteinase inhibitor were downregulated. Molecular alteration for hypertrophy might have initiated. Dexamethasone-induced proteolysis and reversal with insulin-like growth factor-1 occurred rapidly in skeletal muscle; but was relatively delayed in the myocardium.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>To address the potential role of lipotoxicity and mitochondrial function in insulin resistance, we studied mice with high-level expression of uncoupling protein-1 in skeletal muscle (UCP-H mice). Body weight, body length, and bone mineral density were decreased in UCP-H mice compared with wild-type littermates. Forelimb grip strength and muscle mass were strikingly decreased, whereas muscle triglyceride content was increased fivefold in UCP-H mice. Electron microscopy demonstrated lipid accumulation and large mitochondria with abnormal architecture in UCP-H skeletal muscle. ATP content and key mitochondrial proteins were decreased in UCP-H muscle. Despite mitochondrial dysfunction and increased intramyocellular fat, fasting serum glucose was 22% lower and insulin-stimulated glucose transport 80% higher in UCP-H animals. These beneficial effects on glucose metabolism were associated with increased AMP kinase and hexokinase activities, as well as elevated levels of GLUT4 and myocyte enhancer factor-2 proteins A and D in skeletal muscle. These results suggest that UCP-H mice have a mitochondrial myopathy due to depleted energy stores sufficient to compromise growth and impair muscle function. Enhanced skeletal muscle glucose transport in this setting suggests that excess intramyocellular lipid and mitochondrial dysfunction are not sufficient to cause insulin resistance in mice.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcription factors respond to multiple environmental stressors, including hypoxia and hypoglycemia. We report that mice lacking the HIF family member HIF-2alpha (encoded by Epas1) have a syndrome of multiple-organ pathology, biochemical abnormalities and altered gene expression patterns. Histological and ultrastructural analyses showed retinopathy, hepatic steatosis, cardiac hypertrophy, skeletal myopathy, hypocellular bone marrow, azoospermia and mitochondrial abnormalities in these mice. Serum and urine metabolite studies showed hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, altered Krebs cycle function and dysregulated fatty acid oxidation. Biochemical assays showed enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), whereas molecular analyses indicated reduced expression of genes encoding the primary antioxidant enzymes (AOEs). Transfection analyses showed that HIF-2alpha could efficiently transactivate the promoters of the primary AOEs. Prenatal or postnatal treatment of Epas1-/-mice with a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic reversed several aspects of the null phenotype. We propose a rheostat role for HIF-2alpha that allows for the maintenance of ROS as well as mitochondrial homeostasis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Carnitine palmitoyltransferase type II (CPT II) deficiency has three basic phenotypes, late-onset muscular (mild), infantile/juvenile hepatic (intermediate) and severe neonatal. We have measured fatty acid oxidation and CPT II activity and performed mutation studies in 24 symptomatic patients representing the full clinical spectrum of disease. Severe and intermediate phenotypes show a clear correlation with biochemical indices and genetic analysis revealed causative mutations in most patients. Studies of mild phenotypes suggest a more complex interaction, with higher residual fatty acid oxidation, a wider range of CPT II activity (10-60%) but little evidence of genotype-phenotype correlation. Residual CPT II mutant protein from myopathic patients shows thermal instability at 41 degrees C. The common 'polymorphisms' V3681 and M647V are strikingly overrepresented in the myopathic patients, the implication being that they may significantly influence the manifestation of clinical disease and could therefore potentially be considered as a susceptibility variants. Among myopathic individuals, males comprised 88% of patients, suggesting increased susceptibility to clinical disease. A small number of symptomatic patients appear to have significant residual CPT II activity (42-60%) The synergistic interaction of partial deficiencies of CPT II, muscle adenosine monophosphate deaminase and possibly other enzymes of muscle energy metabolism in the aetiology of episodic myopathy deserves wider consideration.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>AlphaB-crystallin (CryAB) is the most abundant small heat shock protein in the heart. Upregulation of CryAB in desmin-related myopathy and its downregulation in end-stage congestive heart failure have both been reported. We previously demonstrated via cardiac-specific transgenesis that modest increases in normal CryAB are not detrimental to the heart, whereas expression of the R120G mutation of CryAB caused a desminopathy. It is generally believed that CryAB plays an important role in protecting the intermediate filaments, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. We hypothesized that CryAB protects the desmin filaments via preventing abnormal desmin protein from aggregating adversely. To test this hypothesis in vivo, mice expressing a desmin mutation that causes a desmin-related cardiomyopathy (D7) were bred into the R120G-CryAB transgenic (TG) background to examine the accumulation and aberrant aggregation of desmin protein. Despite lower mRNA expression of D7-des than in the D7-des TG hearts, the double-TG myocardium exhibited significantly higher desmin protein levels and dramatically more aberrant desmin aggregates than the D7-des TG hearts. The double-TG mice displayed a significantly stronger cardiac hypertrophic response, with the mice dying of congestive heart failure before 7 weeks. To explore the ability of wild-type (WT) CryAB to protect against mutant desmin, a desmin mutant was expressed in both the conventional and WT-CryAB stably transfected HEK cells. Significantly less aberrant desmin aggregation was observed in the WT-CryAB-overexpressing cells than in the HEK cells. The results suggest that CryAB modulates abnormal desmin aggregation and can serve a cardioprotective role.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>MTM1, MTMR2, and SBF2 belong to a family of proteins called the myotubularins. X-linked myotubular myopathy, a severe congenital disorder characterized by hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness in newborn males, is caused by mutations in MTM1 (Laporte et al., 1996). Charcot-Marie-Tooth types 4B1 and 4B2 are severe demyelinating neuropathies caused by mutations in MTMR2 (Bolino et al., 2000) and SBF2/MTMR13 (Senderek et al., 2003), respectively. Although several myotubularins are known to regulate phosphoinositide-phosphate levels in cells, little is known about the actual cellular process that is defective in patients with these diseases. Mutations in worm MTM-6 and MTM-9, myotubularins belonging to two subgroups, disorganize phosphoinositide 3-phosphate localization and block endocytosis in the coelomocytes of Caenorhabditis elegans. We demonstrate that MTM-6 and MTM-9 function as part of a complex to regulate an endocytic pathway that involves the Arf6 GTPase, and we define protein domains required for MTM-6 activity.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Lec3 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell glycosylation mutants have a defect in sialic acid biosynthesis that is shown here to be reflected most sensitively in reduced polysialic acid (PSA) on neural cell adhesion molecules. To identify the genetic origin of the phenotype, genes encoding different factors required for sialic acid biosynthesis were transfected into Lec3 cells. Only a Gne cDNA encoding UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase:ManNAc kinase rescued PSA synthesis. In an in vitro UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase assay, Lec3 cells had no detectable UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity, and Lec3 cells grown in serum-free medium were essentially devoid of sialic acid on glycoproteins. The Lec3 phenotype was rescued by exogenously added N-acetylmannosamine or mannosamine but not by the same concentrations of N-acetylglucosamine, glucosamine, glucose, or mannose. Sequencing of CHO Gne cDNAs identified a nonsense (E35stop) and a missense (G135E) mutation, respectively, in two independent Lec3 mutants. The G135E Lec3 mutant transfected with a rat Gne cDNA had restored in vitro UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity and cell surface PSA expression. Both Lec3 mutants were similarly rescued with a CHO Gne cDNA and with CHO Gne encoding the known kinase-deficient D413K mutation. However, cDNAs encoding the known epimerase-deficient mutation H132A or the new Lec3 G135E Gne mutation did not rescue the Lec3 phenotype. The G135E Gne missense mutation is a novel mechanism for inactivating UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity. Lec3 mutants with no UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity represent sensitive hosts for characterizing disease-causing mutations in the human GNE gene that give rise to sialuria, hereditary inclusion body myopathy, and Nonaka myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Danon disease, primary lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2) deficiency, is histologically characterized by unusual vacuoles bound by membranes with sarcolemmal features in skeletal muscle. We studied skeletal muscle specimens from a male patient with genetically confirmed Danon disease who had two muscle biopsies, at age 20 months and 16 years, and from his mother with cardiomyopathy but without clinically apparent skeletal myopathy. In the patient, the number of vacuoles increased over the 14-year interval between biopsies, suggesting that the number of vacuolated fibers increases with age, and correlates with the development of muscle symptoms. In contrast, in the muscle biopsy from the mother there were no vacuoles even though she had decreased LAMP-2.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Deficiency of the skeletal muscle membrane protein dysferlin causes the related and overlapping neuromuscular disorders limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy. This paper describes the preliminary characterisation of the human dysferlin promoter. The transcriptional start site of dysferlin has been mapped using 5' RACE PCR, which extended the length of the known 5' UTR to 914 bp. Promoter elements have been mapped by assessing the ability of fragments from this region to activate the expression of a luciferase reporter gene borne on a plasmid transfected into differentiated and undifferentiated C2C12 mouse myoblast cells. Finally, the core promoter region has been screened for mutations in suspected dysferlinopathy patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mice infected with myopathic coxsackievirus B1 Tucson (CVB1(T)) develop chronic inflammatory myopathy (CIM) consisting of hind limb weakness and inflammation. Amyopathic virus variants are infectious but attenuated for CIM. In this report, viral clones, chimeras, and sequencing were used to identify viral determinants of CIM. Chimeras identified several regions involved in CIM and localized a weakness determinant to nucleotides 2493 to 3200 of VP1. Sequencing of multiple clones and viruses identified five candidate determinants that were strictly conserved in myopathic viruses with one located in the 5' untranslated region (UTR), three in the VP1 capsid, and one in the 3C protease. Taken together, these studies implicate Tyr-87 and/or Val-136 as candidate determinants of weakness. They also indicate that there are at least two determinants of inflammation and one additional determinant of weakness encoded by myopathic CVB1(T).</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A mouse mutation (p100H/p100H) has been identified that is associated with cardioskeletal myopathy, heart block, delayed growth and early postnatal death. The gene that is disrupted in this mutation encodes the transcription factor Sox6. P19CL6 cells were used as an in vitro cardiomyocyte differentiation system and revealed that Sox6 is expressed exclusively when the cells are committed to differentiate to beating cardiac myocytes. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify the Prtb (Proline-rich transcript of the brain) protein as a Sox6 interactor, and subsequently confirmed the interaction by co-immunoprecipitation. Prtb expression in P19CL6 cells increased with differentiation to beating cardiomyocytes. Using the P19CL6 cells stably transfected with noggin, an antagonist of BMP (Bone Morphogenic Protein), we found that BMP expression is required for Sox6 expression in cardiomyocyte differentiation. Surprisingly, the expression of the alpha1c-subunit gene of the L-type Ca2+ channel decreased in P19CL6 cells as they differentiated to beating cardiac cells. Ectopic expression of Sox6 or Prtb alone in P19CL6 cells caused down-regulation of L-type Ca2+ alpha1c expression, but when Sox6 and Prtb were co-transfected to the cells, L-type Ca2+ alpha1c remained at basal levels. A similar relationship of Sox6 and L-type Ca2+ alpha1c expression was seen in vivo (comparing wild-type and p(100H)/p(100H) mutant mice). Thus, Sox6 is within the BMP pathway in cardiac differentiation, interacts with Prtb and may play a critical role in the regulation of a cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myosin constitutes the major part of the thick filaments in the contractile apparatus of striated muscle. MYH7 encodes the slow/beta-cardiac myosin heavy chain (MyHC), which is the main MyHC isoform in slow, oxidative, type 1 muscle fibers of skeletal muscle. It is also the major MyHC isoform of cardiac ventricles. Numerous missense mutations in the globular head of slow/beta-cardiac MyHC are associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We identified a missense mutation, Arg1845Trp, in the rod region of slow/beta-cardiac MyHC in patients with a skeletal myopathy from two different families. The myopathy was characterized by muscle weakness and wasting with onset in childhood and slow progression, but no overt cardiomyopathy. Slow, oxidative, type 1 muscle fibers showed large inclusions consisting of slow/beta-cardiac MyHC. The features were similar to a previously described entity: hyaline body myopathy. Our findings indicate that the mutated residue of slow/beta-cardiac MyHC is essential for the assembly of thick filaments in skeletal muscle. We propose the term myosin storage myopathy for this disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP), which is structurally characterized by the presence of four ankyrin repeat motifs in its central region, is believed to be localized in the nucleus and to participate in the regulation of cardiac-specific gene expression in cardiomyocytes. However, we recently found that CARP was induced in skeletal muscle by denervation, leading us to speculate that CARP may be induced under some pathological conditions. In the present study, we immunohistochemically analyzed the expression of CARP in 11 cases of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and 14 cases of congenital myopathy. In SMA, CARP was expressed selectively in severely atrophic myofibers, suggesting that CARP expression may reflect the status of muscle atrophy. Furthermore, in the congenital myopathies, the expression patterns of CARP were distinct among the subtypes, which included nemaline myopathy, myotubular myopathy, central core disease, and congenital fiber type disproportion. Although CARP was preferentially expressed in severely damaged myofibers in nemaline myopathy, it was not detected in central core disease. These findings suggest that immunohistochemical evaluation of CARP may be helpful in the diagnosis of SMA and the congenital myopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Cardiac myopathy manifesting as arrhythmias is common in the neurological disease, myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with DM1. METHODS: In a multicenter study, history, ECG, and genetic testing were performed in DM1 patients. RESULTS: In 289 patients in whom the diagnosis of DM1 was confirmed by a prolonged cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) repeat length the most common ambulatory ECG abnormality was frequent ventricular ectopy (16.3%). The 24-hour time domain parameters of SDNN (SD of the NN interval) and SDANN (SD of the mean NN, 5-minute interval) declined as age and CTG repeat length increased (SDNN: -8.5 ms per decade, 95% confidence intervals [CI]-12.9, -4.2, -8.7 ms per 500 CTG repeats, CI -15.7, -1.8, r=0.24, P&lt;0.001; SDANN: -8.1 ms per decade, CI -12.4, -3.8, -8.8 ms per 500 CTG repeats, CI -15.7, -1.9, r=0.23, P&lt;0.001). Short-term frequency domain parameters declined with age only (total power: -658 ms2 per decade, CI: -984, -331, r=0.23, P&lt;0.001; low frequency (LF) power -287 ms2 per decade, CI: -397, -178, r=0.30, P&lt;0.001; high frequency (HF) power: -267 ms2 per decade, CI: -386, -144, r=0.25, P&lt;0.001). The LF/HF ratio increased as the patient aged (0.5 per decade, CI: 0.1, 0.9, r=0.13, P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In DM1 patients a decline in HRV is observed as the patient ages and CTG repeat length increases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Miyoshi myopathy, caused by mutations in the membrane protein dysferlin, is the most common muscular dystrophy that presents in the posterior calves. Its onset is before the age of 30 years and it is associated with marked elevations of serum creatine kinase (CK). In contrast, little is known about calf myopathies with onset after the age of 30, and it is not clear whether such patients have a dysferlinopathy. We describe five patients with a myopathy predominantly affecting the calf muscles, with onset after the age of 30. Muscle tissue was analyzed by immunoblot for dystrophin and dysferlin. All five had normal dysferlin but one had a dystrophinopathy. Serum CK levels ranged from 3 to 15 times the upper limit of normal. In contrast, all of 13 patients presenting before age 30 with calf weakness had a dysferlinopathy. Thus, isolated calf atrophy and weakness with onset after age 30, and associated with serum CK levels that are only moderately elevated, represents a distinct myopathy phenotype. Most of these cases are sporadic, although the overall phenotype appears genetically heterogeneous and dysferlinopathy is uncommon.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Alcoholic myopathy is characterized by muscle weakness and difficulties in gait and locomotion. It is one of the most prevalent skeletal muscle disorders in the Western hemisphere, affecting between 40% and 60% of all chronic alcohol misusers. However, the pathogenic mechanisms are unknown, although recent studies have suggested that membrane defects occur as a consequence of chronic alcohol exposure. It was our hypothesis that alcohol ingestion perturbs membrane-located proteins associated with intracellular signalling and contractility, in particular those relating to calcium homeostasis. To test this, we fed male Wistar rats nutritionally complete liquid diets containing ethanol as 35% of total dietary energy. Controls were pair-fed identical amounts of the same diet in which ethanol was replaced by isocaloric glucose. At the end of 6 weeks, rats were killed and skeletal muscles dissected. These were used to determine important ion-regulatory skeletal muscle proteins including sarcalumenin (SAR), sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) (SERCA1), the junctional face protein of 90 kd (90-JFP), alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-dihydropyridine receptor (alpha(1)-DHPR and alpha(2)-DHPR), and calsequestrin (CSQ) by immunoblotting. The relative abundance of microsomal proteins was determined by immunoblotting using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) technique. The data showed that alcohol-feeding significantly reduced gastrocnemius and hind limb muscle weights (P &lt;.05 in both instances). Concomitant changes included increases in the relative amounts of SERCA1 (P &lt;.05) and Ca(2+)-ATPase activity (P &lt;.025). However, there were no statistically significant changes in either SAR, 90-JFP, alpha(1)-DHPR or alpha(2)-DHPR (P >.2 in all instances). Reductions in CSQ were of marginal significance (P =.0950). We conclude that upregulation of SERCA1 protein and Ca(2+)-ATPase activity may be an adaptive mechanism and/or a contributory process in the pathology of alcohol-induced muscle disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the dysferlin gene cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and Miyoshi myopathy. We report here the results of expression profile analyses and in vitro investigations that point to an interaction between dysferlin and the Ca2+ and lipid-binding proteins, annexins A1 and A2, and define a role for dysferlin in Ca2+-dependent repair of sarcolemmal injury through a process of vesicle fusion. Expression profiling identified a network of genes that are co-regulated in dysferlinopathic mice. Co-immunofluorescence, co-immunoprecipitation, and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy revealed that dysferlin normally associates with both annexins A1 and A2 in a Ca2+ and membrane injury-dependent manner. The distribution of the annexins and the efficiency of sarcolemmal wound-healing are significantly disrupted in dysferlin-deficient muscle. We propose a model of muscle membrane healing mediated by dysferlin that is relevant to both normal and dystrophic muscle and defines the annexins as potential muscular dystrophy genes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Primary carnitine deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of fatty acid oxidation characterized by hypoketotic hypoglycemia and skeletal and cardiac myopathy. It is caused by mutations in the Na+-dependent organic cation transporter, OCTN2. To define the domains involved in carnitine recognition, we evaluated chimeric transporters created by swapping homologous domains between OCTN1, which does not transport carnitine, and OCTN2. Substitution of the C terminus of OCTN2 (amino acid residues 342-557) with the corresponding residues of OCTN1 completely abolished carnitine transport. The progressive substitution of the N terminus of OCTN2 with OCTN1 resulted in a decrease in carnitine transport associated with a progressive increase in the Km toward carnitine from 3.9 +/-0.5 to 141 +/-19 microM. The largest drop in carnitine transport (and increase in Km toward carnitine) was observed with the substitution of residues 341-454 of OCTN2. An additional chimeric transporter (CHIM-9) in which only residues 341-454 of OCTN2 were substituted by OCTN1 had markedly reduced carnitine transport, with an elevated Km toward carnitine (63 +/-5 microM). Site-directed mutagenesis and introduction of residues nonconserved between OCTN1 and OCTN2 in the OCTN2 cDNA indicated that the R341A, L409W, L424Y, and T429I substitutions significantly decreased carnitine transport. Single substitutions did not increase the Km toward carnitine. By contrast, the combination of three of these substitutions (R341W + L409W + T429I) greatly decreased carnitine transport and increased the Km toward carnitine (20.2 +/-4.5 microm). The Arg-341, Leu-409, and Thr-429 residues are all located in predicted transmembrane domains. Involvement of these residues in carnitine transport was further supported by the partial restoration of carnitine transport by the introduction of these OCTN2 residues in the OCTN1 portion of CHIM-9. These studies indicate that multiple domains of the OCTN2 transporter are required for carnitine transport and identify transmembrane residues important for carnitine recognition.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Several dystrophin isoforms are known. The full-length isoform is present in striated and smooth muscles and neurons and its lack causes Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, a progressive myopathy accompanied by mild cognitive deficits and gastrointestinal dismotility. An ultrastructural study was undertaken in the colon of mice lacking full-length dystrophin and maintaining shorter isoforms (mdx mice) to ascertain whether myenteric neurons have an altered morphology. Results showed a significant increase in the size of synaptic vesicle and in the number of recycling vesicles. An enlargement of endoplasmic reticulum cisternae in a subpopulation of neurons was also seen. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that the shorter isoforms were expressed in mdx mice myenteric neurons. These findings indicate the presence of a neuropathy at the myenteric plexus which might justify the defective neuronal control of gastrointestinal motility reported for these animals and which might be correlated with full-length dystrophin loss, since the shorter isoforms are present.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked myotubular myopathy is a muscle disorder caused by mutations on the myotubular myopathy-1 (MTM-1) gene, coding for myotubularin a 65-kDa polypeptide similar to protein phosphatases. Biochemical and in vivo studies define myotubularin as a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PtdIns(3)P] phosphatase. To efficiently express myotubularin in muscle cell lines and adipocytes, we used an adenoviral genome recombinogenic to pcDNA3, and to other widely used expression vectors, to produce adenoviruses expressing wild-type (wt), catalytically inactive C375S, and substrate trap D278A myotubularin.[32P]Orthophosphate labeling followed by phosphoinositide analysis of differentiated L6 and C2C12 cells expressing myotubularin demonstrated increased PtdIns(3)P levels upon expression of the C375S and D278A mutants. In keeping with its biochemical function, overexpression of wt myotubularin as an enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion disrupted the endosomal punctuated staining of the FYVE (Fab1p/YOTB Vac1p/EEA1)-domain-containing PtdIns(3)P binding protein early endosomal antigen 1 as well as of a gluathione-S-transferase-FYVE probe directed to PtdIns(3)P. Expression of wt myotubularin, although not affecting activation of proximal insulin signal transduction targets such as protein kinase B and MAPK, induced a decrease in insulin-induced glucose uptake, whereas basal glucose uptake was augmented by expression of D278A (DA) and C375S (CS) mutants. Moreover, overexpression of myotubularin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes impaired insulin-induced translocation at the plasma membrane of green fluorescent protein-tagged glucose transporter 4. These data indicate that PtdIns(3)P is required to direct glucose transporter 4 to insulin-responsive compartments and/or to allow the translocation of the latter at the plasma membrane. We conclude that myotubularin, by modulating the intracellular levels of PtdIns(3)P, plays a role in the control of vesicular traffic related to glucose transport, by counteracting the activities of the PtdIns(3)P-producing phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Although rachitic/osteomalacic myopathy caused by impaired vitamin D actions has long been described, the molecular pathogenesis remains elusive. To determine physiological roles of vitamin D actions through vitamin D receptor (VDR) in skeletal muscle development, we examined skeletal muscle in VDR gene deleted (VDR -/-) mice, an animal model of vitamin D-dependent rickets type II, for morphological changes and expression of myoregulatory transcription factors and myosin heavy chain isoforms. We found that each muscle fiber was small and variable in size in hindlimb skeletal muscle from VDR -/-mice, although overall myocyte differentiation occurred normally. These abnormalities were independent of secondary metabolic changes such as hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, and were accompanied by aberrantly high and persistent expression of myf5, myogenin, E2A, and early myosin heavy chain isoforms, which are normally down-regulated at earlier stages. Moreover, treatment of VDR-positive myoblastic cells with 1,25(OH)2D3 in vitro caused down-regulation of these factors. These results suggest that VDR plays a physiological role in skeletal muscle development, participating in temporally strict down-regulation of myoregulatory transcription factors. The present study can form a molecular basis of VDR actions on muscle and should help further establish the physiological roles of VDR in muscle development as well as pharmacological effects of vitamin D on muscle functions.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The authors report a 71-year-old woman with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) associated with an R27Q mutation in the CAV3 gene. Immunohistochemistry showed a >90% reduction of caveolin-3 on the sarcolemma by western blot, and anti-dysferlin immunoreactivity was reduced. This case emphasizes that an R27Q missense mutation in the CAV3 gene can lead to various clinical phenotypes including hyperCKemia, rippling muscle disease, distal myopathy, and LGMD1C.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Members of the synaptotagmin family have been proposed to function as Ca2+ sensors in membrane fusion. Syt VII is a ubiquitously expressed synaptotagmin previously implicated in plasma membrane repair and Trypanosoma cruzi invasion, events which are mediated by the Ca2+-regulated exocytosis of lysosomes. Here, we show that embryonic fibroblasts from Syt VII-deficient mice are less susceptible to trypanosome invasion, and defective in lysosomal exocytosis and resealing after wounding. Examination of mutant mouse tissues revealed extensive fibrosis in the skin and skeletal muscle. Inflammatory myopathy, with muscle fiber invasion by leukocytes and endomysial collagen deposition, was associated with elevated creatine kinase release and progressive muscle weakness. Interestingly, similar to what is observed in human polymyositis/dermatomyositis, the mice developed a strong antinuclear antibody response, characteristic of autoimmune disorders. Thus, defective plasma membrane repair in tissues under mechanical stress may favor the development of inflammatory autoimmune disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The myotubularin family is a large eukaryotic group within the tyrosine/dual-specificity phosphatase super-family (PTP/DSP). Among the 14 human members, three are mutated in genetic diseases: myotubular myopathy and two forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. We present an analysis of the myotubularin family in sequenced genomes. The myotubularin family encompasses catalytically active and inactive phosphatases, and both classes are well conserved from nematode to man. Catalytically active myotubularins dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) and PtdIns3,5P2, leading to the production of PtdIns and PtdIns5P. This activity may be modulated by direct interaction with catalytically inactive myotubularins. These phosphoinositides are signaling molecules that are notably involved in vacuolar transport and membrane trafficking. Myotubularins are thus proposed to be implicated in these cellular mechanisms, and recent observations on myotubularins homologues in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans indicate a role in endocytosis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We have previously reported a new autosomal dominant inclusion body myopathy clinically resembling limb girdle muscular dystrophy, associated with Paget disease of bone in the majority and frontotemporal dementia in a third of individuals. The critical locus for this unique disorder now termed IBMPFD is 9 p21.1-p12, spans 5.5 Mb and contains the gene responsible for the recessive quadriceps-sparing inclusion body myopathy (IBM2). Mutation analysis of the GNE gene associated with IBM2 in affected individuals from four IBMPFD families did not identify any mutations, indicating that the two disorders are not allelic. Expression studies indicate that GNE has a tissue-specific splice pattern, with four splice variants. Mutation analysis in three other candidate genes (beta-tropomyosin, NDUFB6 and SMU1) did not identify any mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the skeletal muscle alpha-actin gene (ACTA1) associated with congenital myopathy with excess of thin myofilaments, nemaline myopathy and intranuclear rod myopathy were first described in 1999. At that time, only 15 different missense mutations were known in ACTA1. More than 60 mutations have now been identified. This review analyses this larger spectrum of mutations in ACTA1. It investigates the molecular consequences of the mutations found to date, provides a framework for genotype-phenotype correlation and suggests future studies in light of results of investigation of normal and mutant actin in other systems, notably the actin specific to the indirect flight muscles of Drosophila. The larger series confirms that the majority of ACTA1 mutations are dominant, a small number are recessive and most isolated cases with no previous family history have de novo dominant mutations. The severity of the disease caused ranges from lack of spontaneous movements at birth requiring immediate mechanical ventilation, to mild disease compatible with life to adulthood. Overall, the mutations within ACTA1 are randomly distributed throughout the protein. However, the larger series of mutations now available indicates that there may be clustering of mutations associated with some phenotypes, e.g. actin myopathy. This would suggest that interference with certain actin functions may be more associated with certain phenotypes, though the exact pathophysiology of the actin mutations remains unknown.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>AIMS: Mutations in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA) have been reported to be involved in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) associated with conduction system disease and/or skeletal myopathy. The aim of this study was to perform a mutational analysis of LMNA in a large white population of patients affected by dilated cardiomyopathy with or without associated symptoms. METHODS: We performed screening of the coding sequence of LMNA on DNA samples from 66 index cases, and carried out cell transfection experiments to examine the functional consequences of the mutations identified. RESULTS: A new missense (E161K) mutation was identified in a family with early atrial fibrillation and a previously described (R377H) mutation in another family with a quadriceps myopathy associated with DCM. A new mutation (28insA) leading to a premature stop codon was identified in a family affected by DCM with conduction defects. No mutation in LMNA was found in cases with isolated dilated cardiomyopathy. Functional analyses have identified potential physiopathological mechanisms involving identified mutations, such as haploinsufficiency (28insA) or intermediate filament disorganisation (E161K, R377H). CONCLUSION: For the first time, a specific phenotype characterised by early atrial fibrillation is associated with LMNA mutation. Conversely, mutations in LMNA appear as a rare cause of isolated dilated cardiomyopathy. The variable phenotypes observed in LMNA-DCM might be explained by the variability of functional consequences of LMNA mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The authors describe a family in which two individuals have clinical distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV). While the clinical and most of the pathologic features in these patients were compatible with a diagnosis of DMRV, the presence of inflammatory changes in the connective tissue between muscle fibers was not. Gene analysis revealed a compound heterozygous mutation in these individuals, characterized by V572L and I472T.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The syntrophins and dystrobrevins are members of the dystrophin-associated protein complex, and are thought to function as modular adaptors for signalling proteins recruited to the sarcolemmal membrane. We have characterised the expression of the syntrophins (alpha-, beta1-, and beta2-) and alpha-dystrobrevin by immunohistochemistry in normal human muscle and in biopsies from 162 patients with myopathies of unknown aetiology (with normal staining for dystrophin and other dystrophin-associated proteins). Unlike mice, beta2-syntrophin is expressed at the sarcolemma in post-natal human skeletal muscle. Deficiency of alpha-dystrobrevin +/-beta2-syntrophin was present in 16/162 (10%) patients, compared to age-matched controls. All patients presented with congenital-onset hypotonia and weakness, although there was variability in clinical severity. Two major clinical patterns emerged: patients with deficiency of beta2-syntrophin and alpha-dystrobrevin presented with severe congenital weakness and died in the first year of life, and two patients with deficiency of alpha-dystrobrevin had congenital muscular dystrophy with complete external ophthalmoplegia. We have sequenced the coding regions of alpha-dystrobrevin and beta2-syntrophin in these patients, and identified a new isoform of dystrobrevin, but have not identified any mutations. This suggests that disease causing mutations occur outside the coding region of these genes, in gene(s) encoding other components of the syntrophin-dystrobrevin subcomplex, or in gene(s) responsible for their post-translational modification and normal localisation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report a Belgian family with autosomal dominant, late-onset, distal myopathy with selective foot extensor muscle involvement of the lower legs. Linkage to the tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD) locus 2q31 was not evident at first because of incomplete disease penetrance in a 50-year-old asymptomatic family member. An abnormal tibialis anterior muscle biopsy established her subclinical status and linkage of the family to the TMD locus. Mutation analysis showed a disease-specific, heterozygous point mutation in the last exon, Mex6, of the titin gene. This is the third mutation found in TMD and the second European family with TMD outside the Finnish population, suggesting that titinopathies may occur in various populations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: The mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder of infancy or childhood characterized by decreased mitochondrial DNA copy number in affected tissues. Mutations in 2 genes involved in deoxyribonucleotide metabolism, the deoxyguanosine kinase gene (DGK) and the thymidine kinase 2 gene (TK2), have been related to this syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To describe 3 siblings with the myopathic form of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome and a homozygous mutation in the TK2 gene. PATIENTS AND METHODS: These children developed normally until 12 to 16 months of age, when they started showing difficulty walking, which rapidly progressed to severe limb weakness. They died of respiratory failure between the ages of 23 and 40 months. Histochemical and biochemical studies of respiratory chain complexes were performed in muscle biopsy specimens. The whole coding region of the TK2 gene was sequenced. RESULTS: Muscle biopsy showed ragged-red cytochrome-c oxidase-negative fibers. All affected siblings had markedly decreased activities of respiratory chain complexes. Southern blot analysis showed severe reduction of the mitochondrial DNA-nuclear DNA ratio in muscle biopsy specimens from all patients, indicating 80% to 90% mitochondrial DNA depletion. Sequencing of the TK2 gene showed a homozygous C-->T transition at nucleotide 228 in exon 5, which changes a threonine to a methionine at position 77 (T77M). CONCLUSIONS: These results document the importance of screening the TK2 gene in patients with myopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome and confirm that exon 5 is a "hot spot" for TK2 mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We describe a family with an extremely mild form of X-linked myotubular myopathy. Three affected males survived to adulthood with sufficient muscle strength to enable them to carry out normal daily activities. The mildness of the myopathy in this family is highlighted by the following: no neonatal or infant mortality resulting from the myopathy; one affected male who did not have neonatal asphyxia and had normal early motor milestones - this affected male was able to increase his muscle bulk and strength to normal by weightlifting; and a 55-year-old male who still lives an independent life. DNA sequencing identified a novel missense mutation - G469A (E157K) - in exon 7 of the MTM1 gene in this family. To our knowledge, this is the third X-linked myotubular myopathy family, with multiple adult survivors, to be reported in the literature.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotubularin is a dual-specific phosphatase that dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate. Mutations in myotubularin result in the human disease X-linked myotubular myopathy, characterized by persistence of muscle fibers that retain an immature phenotype. We have previously reported the identification of the 3-phosphatase adapter protein (3-PAP), a catalytically inactive member of the myotubularin gene family, which coprecipitates lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-3-phosphatase activity from lysates of human platelets. We have now identified myotubularin as the catalytically active 3-phosphatase subunit interacting with 3-PAP. A 65-kDa polypeptide, coprecipitating with endogenous 3-PAP, was purified from SDS/PAGE, subjected to trypsin digestion, and analyzed by collision-induced dissociation tandem MS. Three peptides derived from human myotubularin were identified. Association between 3-PAP and myotubularin was confirmed by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation of both endogenous and recombinant proteins expressed in K562 cells. Recombinant myotubularin localized to the plasma membrane, causing extensive filopodia formation. However, coexpression of 3-PAP with myotubularin led to attenuation of the plasma membrane phenotype, associated with myotubularin relocalization to the cytosol. Collectively these studies indicate 3-PAP functions as an "adapter" for myotubularin, regulating myotubularin intracellular location and thereby altering the phenotype resulting from myotubularin overexpression.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Recessive mutations in two of the three collagen VI genes, COL6A2 and COL6A3, have recently been shown to cause Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD), a frequently severe disorder characterized by congenital muscle weakness with joint contractures and coexisting distal joint hyperlaxity. Dominant mutations in all three collagen VI genes had previously been associated with the considerably milder Bethlem myopathy. Here we report that a de novo heterozygous deletion of the COL6A1 gene can also result in a severe phenotype of classical UCMD precluding ambulation. The internal gene deletion occurs near a minisatellite DNA sequence in intron 8 that removes 1.1 kb of genomic DNA encompassing exons 9 and 10. The resulting mutant chain contains a 33-amino acid deletion near the amino-terminus of the triple-helical domain but preserves a unique cysteine in the triple-helical domain important for dimer formation prior to secretion. Thus, dimer formation and secretion of abnormal tetramers can occur and exert a strong dominant negative effect on microfibrillar assembly, leading to a loss of normal localization of collagen VI in the basement membrane surrounding muscle fibers. Consistent with this mechanism was our analysis of a patient with a much milder phenotype, in whom we identified a previously described Bethlem myopathy heterozygous in-frame deletion of 18 amino acids somewhat downstream in the triple-helical domain, a result of exon 14 skipping in the COL6A1 gene. This deletion removes the crucial cysteine, so that dimer formation cannot occur and the abnormal molecule is not secreted, preventing the strong dominant negative effect. Our studies provide a biochemical insight into genotype-phenotype correlations in this group of disorders and establish that UCMD can be caused by dominantly acting mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Four different phenotypes have been associated with CAV3 mutations: limb girdle muscular dystrophy-1C (LGMD-1C), rippling muscle disease (RMD), and distal myopathy (DM), as well as idiopathic and familial hyperCKemia (HCK). Detailed molecular characterization of two caveolin-3 mutations (P104L and DeltaTFT), associated with LGMD-1C, shows them to impart a dominant-negative effect on wild-type caveolin-3, rendering it dysfunctional through sequestration in the Golgi complex. Interestingly, substitution of glutamine for arginine at amino acid position 26 (R26Q) of caveolin-3 is associated not only with RMD but also with DM and HCK. However, the phenotypic behavior of the caveolin-3 R26Q mutation has never been evaluated in cultured cells. Thus we characterized the cellular and molecular properties of the R26Q mutant protein to better understand how this mutation can manifest as such distinct disease phenotypes. Here, we show that the caveolin-3 R26Q mutant is mostly retained at the level of the Golgi complex. The caveolin-3 R26Q mutant formed oligomers of a much larger size than wild-type caveolin-3 and was excluded from caveolae-enriched membranes. However, caveolin-3 R26Q did not behave in a dominant-negative fashion when coexpressed with wild-type caveolin-3. Thus the R26Q mutation behaves differently from other caveolin-3 mutations (P104L and DeltaTFT) that have been previously characterized. These data provide a possible explanation for the scope of the various disease phenotypes associated with the caveolin-3 R26Q mutation. We propose a haploinsufficiency model in which reduced levels of wild-type caveolin-3, although not rendered dysfunctional due to the caveolin-3 R26Q mutant protein, are insufficient for normal muscle cell function.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Welander distal myopathy (WDM) is a late adult-onset autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by a slow progression and distal limb weakness of the extremity muscles. The WDM locus has been mapped to chromosome 2p13. Within this region a common shared haplotype co-segregates in all affected patients, indicating a founder effect. By undertaking an extended linkage analysis we have significantly reduced the WDM locus to a critical interval of approximately 1.2 Mb flanked by markers D2S358 and PAC3-H52. The dysferlin gene, a strong candidate gene responsible for two other distal myopathies in the same region, is located centromeric to PAC3-H52 and can thereby formally be excluded as cause for WDM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: The X-linked McLeod neuroacanthocytosis syndrome is a multisystem disorder with hematologic, neuromuscular, and central nervous system (CNS) manifestations. All carriers of the McLeod blood group phenotype examined so far had at least subclinical signs of systemic involvement. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Evaluation of two brothers carrying the McLeod phenotype with neurologic examination, immunohematology, RBC membrane protein Western blotting, analysis of XK DNA sequence and RNA levels, muscle histology including XK/Kell immunohistochemistry, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and quantified positron emission tomography (PET). RESULTS: Immunohematology and Western blotting confirmed presence of the McLeod blood group phenotype. No acanthocytosis or other hematologic anomalies were found. XK gene sequence analysis revealed a missense mutation in exon 3 (E327K). WBC XK RNA levels were not decreased. There were no neuromuscular and CNS signs or symptoms. In addition, no subclinical involvement was discovered on the basis of normal muscle histology with a physiologic pattern of XK and Kell immunohistochemistry, normal cerebral MRI, and quantified PET. CONCLUSION: Known disease-causing XK gene mutations comprised deletions, nonsense, or splice-site mutations predicting absent or truncated XK protein devoid of the Kell-protein binding site. Although the E327K missense mutation was associated with the immunohematologic characteristics of McLeod syndrome, the mutated XK protein seemed to be largely functional. These findings contribute to the understanding of the physiology of XK and Kell proteins, and the pathogenetic mechanisms of acanthocytosis, myopathy, and striatal neurodegeneration in McLeod syndrome.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene is the causative gene for autosomal-recessive hereditary inclusion-body myopathy (h-IBM). Two sisters affected with autosomal-recessive h-IBM were shown to be compound heterozygous for two novel GNE mutations: a large deletion involving exons 1-9, and a R162C amino acid change in the epimerase domain. This is the first deletion event observed in a GNE allele and expands the molecular pathogenesis of autosomal-recessive h-IBM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To study dysferlin gene mutations and genotype-phenotype correlations in Japanese patients with Miyoshi myopathy (MM). BACKGROUND: MM is an autosomal recessive distal muscular dystrophy that arises from mutations in the dysferlin gene. This gene is also mutated in families with limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2B. METHODS: The authors examined 25 Japanese patients with MM. Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral lymphocytes of the patients. The PCR products of each of 55 exons were screened by single strand conformation polymorphism or direct sequencing from the PCR fragments. RESULTS: The authors identified 16 different mutations in 20 patients with MM; 10 were novel. Mutations in Japanese patients are distributed along the entire length of the gene. CONCLUSIONS: Four mutations (C1939G, G3370T, 3746delG, and 4870delT) are relatively more prevalent in this population, accounting for 60% of the mutations in this study. This study revealed that the G3370T mutation was associated with milder forms of MM and the G3510A mutation was associated with a more severe form.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotubularins (MTMs) constitute a large family of lipid phosphatases that specifically dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (3)P. MTM1 and MTM2 are mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (type 4B), respectively, although the mechanisms whereby MTM dysfunction leads to these diseases is unknown. To gain insight into MTM function, we undertook the study of MTMs in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which possesses representative homologues of the four major subgroups of MTMs identified in mammals. As in mammals, we found that C. elegans MTMs mediate distinct functions. let-512 (vps34) encodes the C. elegans homologue of the yeast and mammalian homologue of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Vps34. We found that reduction of mtm-6 (F53A2.8) function by RNA inhibition rescued the larval lethality of let-512 (vps34) mutants and that the reduction of mtm-1 (Y110A7A.5) activity by RNA inhibition rescued the endocytosis defect of let-512 animals. Together, these observations provide genetic evidence that MTMs negatively regulate phosphatidylinositol (3)P levels. Analysis of MTM expression patterns using transcriptional green fluorescence protein reporters demonstrated that these two MTMs exhibit mostly non-overlapping expression patterns and that MTM-green fluorescence protein fusion proteins are localized to different subcellular locations. These observations suggest that some of the different functions of MTMs might, in part, be a consequence of unique expression and localization patterns. However, our finding that at least three C. elegans MTMs play essential roles in coelomocyte endocytosis, a process that also requires VPS34, indicates that MTMs do not simply turn off VPS34 but unexpectedly also function as positive regulators of biological processes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in desmin gene have been identified in patients with cardiac and skeletal myopathy characterized by intracytoplasmic accumulation of desmin-reactive deposits and electron-dense granular aggregates. We characterized two new desminopathy families with unusual features of adult-onset, slowly progressive, diffuse skeletal myopathy and respiratory insufficiency. Progressive reduction of respiratory muscle strength became clinically detectable between the 3rd and the 8th years of illness and led to recurrent chest infections and death in one of the patients. Novel mutations, A357P and L370P, predicted to introduce proline residue into a highly conserved alpha-helical region of desmin, were identified. Proline is known to disrupt the alpha-helix. In addition, the A357P mutation distorts a unique stutter sequence that is considered to be critically important for proper filament assembly. Functional assessment in two cell-lines, one of which does and the other of which does not constitutively produce type III intermediate filaments, demonstrated the inability of mutant desmin carrying either the A357P or the L370P mutation to polymerize and form an intracellular filamentous network. The results of this study indicate that respiratory insufficiency is an intrinsic feature of disease associated with specific desmin mutations; in some patients, respiratory weakness may present as a dominant clinical manifestation and a major cause of disability and death.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is a major chaperone that folds protein and prevents aggregation. The Hsp70 family contains both constitutive and stress-inducible forms. In humans, two of the inducible Hsp70 genes are located within the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on 6p21.3, as a duplicated locus, 12 kb apart from each other. We report that loss of one of the duplicated Hsp70 genes, the bovine homologue within the bovine MHC, is responsible for hereditary myopathy of diaphragmatic muscles (HMDM) in Holstein-Friesian cattle. Although the remaining Hsp70 gene is intact, Hsp70 protein levels are dramatically decreased in affected cattle. In normal diaphragmatic muscle, Hsp70 binds several proteins involved in energy metabolism including glycogen phosphorylase (PYGM). Immunohistochemical staining indicated that PYGM accumulated in the HMDM-specific core-like structures in affected cattle. Misfolding of energy-related proteins due to Hsp70 deficiency might lead to protein aggregation and muscle fibre degeneration.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The MAPKs are important transducers of growth and stress stimuli in virtually all eukaryotic cell types. In the mammalian heart, MAPK signaling pathways have been hypothesized to regulate myocyte growth in response to developmental signals or physiologic and pathologic stimuli. Here we generated cardiac-specific transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative mutants of p38alpha, MKK3, or MKK6. Remarkably, attenuation of cardiac p38 activity produced a progressive growth response and myopathy in the heart that correlated with the degree of enzymatic inhibition. Moreover, dominant-negative p38alpha, MKK3, and MKK6 transgenic mice each showed enhanced cardiac hypertrophy following aortic banding, Ang II infusion, isoproterenol infusion, or phenylephrine infusion for 14 days. A mechanism underlying this enhanced-growth profile was suggested by the observation that dominant-negative p38alpha directly augmented nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcriptional activity and its nuclear translocation. In vivo, NFAT-dependent luciferase reporter transgenic mice showed enhanced activation in the presence of the dominant-negative p38alpha transgene before and after the onset of cardiac hypertrophy. More significantly, genetic disruption of the calcineurin Abeta gene rescued hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and depressed functional capacity observed in p38-inhibited mice. Collectively, these observations indicate that reduced p38 signaling in the heart promotes myocyte growth through a mechanism involving enhanced calcineurin-NFAT signaling.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Deletion of murine Smn exon 7, the most frequent mutation found in spinal muscular atrophy, has been directed to either both satellite cells, the muscle progenitor cells and fused myotubes, or fused myotubes only. When satellite cells were mutated, mutant mice develop severe myopathic process, progressive motor paralysis, and early death at 1 mo of age (severe mutant). Impaired muscle regeneration of severe mutants correlated with defect of myogenic precursor cells both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, when satellite cells remained intact, mutant mice develop similar myopathic process but exhibit mild phenotype with median survival of 8 mo and motor performance similar to that of controls (mild mutant). High proportion of regenerating myofibers expressing SMN was observed in mild mutants compensating for progressive loss of mature myofibers within the first 6 mo of age. Then, in spite of normal contractile properties of myofibers, mild mutants develop reduction of muscle force and mass. Progressive decline of muscle regeneration process was no more able to counterbalance muscle degeneration leading to dramatic loss of myofibers. These data indicate that intact satellite cells remarkably improve the survival and motor performance of mutant mice suffering from chronic myopathy, and suggest a limited potential of satellite cells to regenerate skeletal muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Muscular dystrophy includes a diverse group of inherited muscle diseases characterized by wasting and weakness of skeletal muscle. Mutations in dysferlin are linked to two clinically distinct muscle diseases, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B and Miyoshi myopathy, but the mechanism that leads to muscle degeneration is unknown. Dysferlin is a homologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans fer-1 gene, which mediates vesicle fusion to the plasma membrane in spermatids. Here we show that dysferlin-null mice maintain a functional dystrophin-glycoprotein complex but nevertheless develop a progressive muscular dystrophy. In normal muscle, membrane patches enriched in dysferlin can be detected in response to sarcolemma injuries. In contrast, there are sub-sarcolemmal accumulations of vesicles in dysferlin-null muscle. Membrane repair assays with a two-photon laser-scanning microscope demonstrated that wild-type muscle fibres efficiently reseal their sarcolemma in the presence of Ca2+. Interestingly, dysferlin-deficient muscle fibres are defective in Ca2+-dependent sarcolemma resealing. Membrane repair is therefore an active process in skeletal muscle fibres, and dysferlin has an essential role in this process. Our findings show that disruption of the muscle membrane repair machinery is responsible for dysferlin-deficient muscle degeneration, and highlight the importance of this basic cellular mechanism of membrane resealing in human disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A lethal form of nemaline myopathy, named "Amish Nemaline Myopathy" (ANM), is linked to a nonsense mutation at codon Glu180 in the slow skeletal muscle troponin T (TnT) gene. We found that neither the intact nor the truncated slow TnT protein was present in the muscle of patients with ANM. The complete loss of slow TnT is consistent with the observed recessive pattern of inheritance of the disease and indicates a critical role of the COOH-terminal T2 domain in the integration of TnT into myofibrils. Expression of slow and fast isoforms of TnT is fiber-type specific. The lack of slow TnT results in selective atrophy of type 1 fibers. Slow TnT confers a higher Ca2+ sensitivity than does fast TnT in single fiber contractility assays. Despite the lack of slow TnT, individuals with ANM have normal muscle power at birth. The postnatal onset and infantile progression of ANM correspond to a down-regulation of cardiac and embryonic splice variants of fast TnT in normal developing human skeletal muscle, suggesting that the fetal TnT isoforms complement slow TnT. These results lay the foundation for understanding the molecular pathophysiology and the potential targeted therapy of ANM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The ryanodine receptor (RYR1) is an essential component of the calcium homeostasis of the skeletal muscle in mammals. Inactivation of the RYR1 gene in mice is lethal at birth. In humans only missense and in-frame mutations in the RYR1 gene have been associated so far with various muscle disorders including malignant hyperthermia, central core disease and the moderate form of multi-minicore disease (MmD). We identified a cryptic splicing mutation in the RYR1 gene that resulted in a 90% decrease of the normal RYR1 transcript in skeletal muscle. The 14646+2.99 kb A-->G mutation was associated with the classical form of MmD with ophthalmoplegia, whose genetic basis was previously unknown. The mutation present at a homozygous level was responsible for a massive depletion of the RYR1 protein in skeletal muscle. The mutation was not expressed in lymphoblastoid cells, pointing toward a tissue specific splicing mechanism. This first report of an out-of-frame mutation that affects the amount of RYR1 raised the question of the amount of RYR1 needed for skeletal muscle function in humans.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Rigid spine muscular dystrophy and the classical form of multiminicore disease are caused by mutations in SEPN1 gene, leading to a new clinical entity referred to as SEPN1-related myopathy. SEPN1 codes for selenoprotein N, a new member of the selenoprotein family, the function of which is still unknown. In a previous study, two isoforms were deduced from SEPN1 transcript analyses. Using polyclonal antibodies directed against SEPN1 and cDNA constructs encoding for the two isoforms, we show that the main SEPN1 gene product corresponds to a 70 kDa protein, containing a single selenocysteine residue. Subcellular fractionation experiments and endoglycosidase H sensitivity indicate that SEPN1 is a glycoprotein-localized within the endoplasmic reticulum. Immunofluorescence analyses confirm this subcellular localization and green fluorescent protein fusion experiments demonstrate the presence of an endoplasmic reticulum-addressing and -retention signal within the N-terminus. SEPN1 is present at a high level in several human fetal tissues and at a lower level in adult ones, including skeletal muscle. Its high expression in cultured myoblasts is also down-regulated in differentiating myotubes, suggesting a role for SEPN1 in early development and in cell proliferation or regeneration.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) with autosomal recessive (AR) inheritance is a heterogeneous group of inherited motor and sensory neuropathies. In some families from Japan and Brazil, a demyelinating CMT, mainly characterized by the presence of myelin outfoldings on nerve biopsies, cosegregated as an autosomal recessive trait with early-onset glaucoma. We identified two such large consanguineous families from Tunisia and Morocco with ages at onset ranging from 2 to 15 years. We mapped this syndrome to chromosome 11p15, in a 4.6-cM region overlapping the locus for an isolated demyelinating ARCMT (CMT4B2). In these two families, we identified two different nonsense mutations in the myotubularin-related 13 gene, MTMR13. The MTMR protein family includes proteins with a phosphoinositide phosphatase activity, as well as proteins in which key catalytic residues are missing and that are thus called "pseudophosphatases." MTM1, the first identified member of this family, and MTMR2 are responsible for X-linked myotubular myopathy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B1, an isolated peripheral neuropathy with myelin outfoldings, respectively. Both encode active phosphatases. It is striking to note that mutations in MTMR13 also cause peripheral neuropathy with myelin outfoldings, although it belongs to a pseudophosphatase subgroup, since its closest homologue is MTMR5/Sbf1. This is the first human disease caused by mutation in a pseudophosphatase, emphasizing the important function of these putatively inactive enzymes. MTMR13 may be important for the development of both the peripheral nerves and the trabeculum meshwork, which permits the outflow of the aqueous humor. Both of these tissues have the same embryonic origin.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Heritable dilated cardiomyopathy is a genetically highly heterogeneous disease. To date 17 different chromosomal loci have been described for autosomal dominant forms of dilated cardiomyopathy with or without additional clinical manifestations. Among the 10 mutated genes associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, the lamin A/C (LMNA) gene has been reported in forms associated with conduction-system disease with or without skeletal muscle myopathy. For the first time, we report here a French family affected with a new phenotype composed of an autosomal dominant severe dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects or atrial/ventricular arrhythmias, and a specific quadriceps muscle myopathy. In all previously reported cases with both cardiac and neuromuscular involvement, neuromuscular disorders preceded cardiac abnormalities. The screening of the coding sequence of the LMNA gene on all family members was performed and we identified a missense mutation (R377H) in the lamin A/C gene that cosegregated with the disease in the family. Cell transfection experiments showed that the R377H mutation leads to mislocalization of both lamin and emerin. These results were obtained in both muscular (C2C12) and non-muscular cells (COS-7). This new phenotype points out the wide spectrum of neuromuscular and cardiac manifestations associated with lamin A/C mutations, with the functional consequence of this mutation seemingly associated with a disorganization of the lamina.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Synemin is a member of the intermediate protein superfamily. Previous studies in avian and rodent skeletal and cardiac muscles have demonstrated that synemin localises at the Z-band, where it associates with desmin and alpha-actinin. In the present study, the distribution of synemin was examined using immunohistochemistry in muscle biopsy specimens from patients suffering from myofibrillar myopathy (MM, n=6), dermatomyositis (DM, n=3), inclusion body myositis (IBM, n=5), oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPD, n=3) and denervation atrophy (DA, n=3), to investigate the possible participation of this protein in the pathogenesis of various muscular diseases. Of patients affected by MM, two showed the presence of mutations in the desmin gene; none had mutations in the alphaB-crystallin gene; and no mutations were identified in synemin or syncoilin genes of three patients. Synemin immunohistochemistry disclosed a faint staining corresponding to the Z-bands in the cytoplasm of control muscle fibres; in contrast, focal aggregates of synemin were seen in patients with MM. Increased synemin immunoreactivity was identified diffusely or in the subsarcolemmal space of scattered fibres in patients with DM, and in vacuolated fibres of patients with IBM and OPD. Strong synemin immunoreactivity was observed in target formations and atrophic fibres of patients with denervating disorders, as well as in atrophic fibres, regardless of their origin, in all patients studied. Synemin co-localised with desmin, as seen on consecutive serial sections immunostained with anti-synemin or anti-desmin antibodies. These observations demonstrate abnormal accumulations containing both synemin and desmin in muscle fibres in patients with MM, IBM, DM, OPD and DA. Considering the important role of synemin as one of intermediate filaments of skeletal and cardiac muscle, its destruction and accumulation in the intracellular debris suggest that synemin may participate in the pathogenesis of these disorders.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The myotubularin (MTM) family constitutes one of the most highly conserved protein-tyrosine phosphatase subfamilies in eukaryotes. MTM1, the archetypal member of this family, is mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy, whereas mutations in the MTM-related (MTMR)2 gene cause the type 4B1 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a severe hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. In this study, we identified a protein that specifically interacts with MTMR2 but not MTM1. The interacting protein was shown by mass spectrometry to be MTMR5, a catalytically inactive member of the MTM family. We also demonstrate that MTMR2 interacts with MTMR5 via its coiled-coil domain and that mutations in the coiled-coil domain of either MTMR2 or MTMR5 abrogate this interaction. Through this interaction, MTMR5 increases the enzymatic activity of MTMR2 and dictates its subcellular localization. This article demonstrates an active MTM member being regulated by an inactive family member.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Phosphoinositides control many different processes required for normal cellular function. Myotubularins are a family of Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) phosphatases identified by the positional cloning of the MTM1 gene in patients suffering from X-linked myotubular myopathy and the MTMR2 gene in patients suffering from the demyelinating neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B. MTM1 is a phosphatidylinositol phosphatase with reported specificity toward PtdIns3P, while the related proteins MTMR2 and MTMR3 hydrolyze both PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,5)P2. We have investigated MTM1 and MTMR6 and find that they use PtdIns(3,5)P2 in addition to PtdIns3P as a substrate in vitro. The product of PtdIns(3,5)P2 hydrolysis, PtdIns5P, causes MTM1 to form a heptameric ring that is 12.5 nm in diameter, and it is a specific allosteric activator of MTM1, MTMR3, and MTMR6. A disease-causing mutation at arginine 69 of MTM1 falling within a putative pleckstrin homology domain reduces the ability of the enzyme to respond to PtdIns5P. We propose that the myotubularin family of enzymes utilize both PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,5)P2 as substrates, and that PtdIns5P functions in a positive feedback loop controlling their activity. These findings highlight the importance of regulated phosphatase activity for the control of phosphoinositide metabolism.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Recent studies in desmin (-/-) mice have shown that the targeted ablation of desmin leads to pathological changes of the extrasarcomeric intermediate filament cytoskeleton, as well as structural and functional abnormalities of mitochondria in striated muscle. Here, we report on a novel heterozygous single adenine insertion mutation (c.5141_5143insA) in a 40-year-old patient with a distal myopathy. The insertion mutation leads to a frameshift and a truncated desmin (K239fs242). Using transfection studies in SW13 and BHK21 cells, we show that the K239fsX242 desmin mutant is incapable of forming a desmin intermediate filament network. Furthermore, it induces the collapse of a pre-existing desmin cytoskeleton, alters the subcellular distribution of mitochondria and leads to abnormal cytoplasmic protein aggregates reminiscent of desmin-immunoreactive granulofilamentous material seen in the ultrastructural analysis of the patient's muscle. Analysis of mitochondrial function in isolated saponin-permeablized skeletal muscle fibres from our patient showed decreased maximal rates of respiration with the NAD-dependent substrate combination glutamate and malate, as well as a higher amytal sensitivity of respiration, indicating an in vivo inhibition of complex I activity. Our findings suggest that the heterozygous K239fsX242 desmin insertion mutation has a dominant negative effect on the polymerization process of desmin intermediate filaments and affects not only the subcellular distribution, but also biochemical properties of mitochondria in diseased human skeletal muscle. As a consequence, the intermediate filament pathology-induced mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to the degeneration/regeneration process leading to progressive muscle dysfunction in human desminopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a dystrophinopathy, and its associated gene is located on Xp21. Moreover, utrophin, a recently identified structural homologue of dystrophin is reported to be up-regulated in DMD. In order to investigate the association between utrophin and muscle regeneration in DMD, an immunohistochemical study using antibodies to utrophin, dystrophin, vimentin and desmin was carried out in 17 cases of DMD, 3 cases of polymyositis and 1 case of dermatomyositis. Dystrophin was negative in almost all cases of DMD, but positive in all cases of inflammatory myopathy (IM). Utrophin was positive in 94.0% of DMD and in 75.0% of IM. 36.4% of the myofibers were positive in DMD, as compared to 10.5% in IM (p=0.001). In both groups, utrophin positivity was present most commonly in small regenerating fibers (p=0.001, 0.013). Vimentin and desmin were intensely positive in regenerating fibers in all cases of DMD and IM. 34.4% and 35.4% of myofibers were positive for vimentin and desmin in DMD, as compared to 21.8% and 20.9% in IM (p=0.001, 0.001). In both groups, vimentin and desmin positivity were present most commonly in small regenerating fibers (p=0.001, 0.001). The staining intensities of utrophin, vimentin and desmin were also higher in small regenerating fibers. These results show that utrophin up-regulation is regeneration-associated, and that it is proportional to the quantity of regenerating myofibers, but is not specific for DMD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACE1 and BACE2 are recently discovered enzymes participating in processing of amyloid beta precursor protein (AbetaPP). Their discovery is contributing importantly to understanding the mechanism of amyloid-beta generation, and hence the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM) and hereditary inclusion-body myopathy (h-IBM) are progressive muscle diseases in which overproduction of AbetaPP and accumulation of its presumably toxic proteolytic product amyloid-beta (Abeta) in abnormal muscle fibers appear to play an important upstream role in the pathogenic cascade. In normal human muscle AbetaPP was also shown to be present and presumably playing a role (a) at neuromuscular junctions and (b) during muscle development. To investigate whether BACE1 and BACE2 play a role in normal and diseased human muscle, we have now studied them by immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting in 35 human muscle biopsies, including: 5 s-IBM; 5 chromosome-9p1-linked quadriceps-sparing h-IBM; and 25 control muscle biopsies. In addition, expression of BACE1 and BACE2 was studied in normal cultured human muscle. Our studies demonstrate that BACE1 and BACE2 (a) are expressed in normal adult muscle at the postsynaptic domain of neuromuscular junctions, and in cultured human muscle; (b) are accumulated in the form of plaque-like inclusions in both s-IBM and h-IBM vacuolated muscle fibers; and (c) are immunoreactive in necrotizing muscle fibers. Accordingly, BACE1 and BACE2 participate in normal and abnormal processes of human muscle, suggesting that their functions are broader than previously thought.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Desmin myopathy is a familial or sporadic disorder characterized by the presence of desmin mutations that cause skeletal muscle weakness associated with cardiac conduction block, arrhythmia and heart failure. Distinctive histopathologic features include intracytoplasmic accumulation of desmin-reactive deposits and electron-dense granular aggregates in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. We describe two families with features of adult-onset slowly progressive skeletal myopathy without cardiomyopathy. N342D point mutation was present in the desmin helical rod domain in patients of family 1, and I451M mutation was found in the non-helical tail domain in patients of family 2. Of interest, the same I451M mutation has previously been reported in patients with cardiomyopathy and no signs of skeletal myopathy. Some carriers of the I451M mutation did not develop any disease, suggesting incomplete penetrance. Expression studies demonstrated inability of the N342D mutant desmin to form cellular filamentous network, confirming the pathogenic role of this mutation, but the network was not affected by the tail-domain I451M mutation. Progressive skeletal myopathy is a rare phenotypic variant of desmin myopathy allelic to the more frequent cardio-skeletal form.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The congenital myopathies are a group of disorders characterised by the predominance of specific histological features observed in biopsied muscle. Central core disease and nemaline myopathy are examples of congenital myopathies that have specific histological characteristics but significantly overlapping clinical pictures. Central core disease is an autosomal dominant disorder with variable penetrance which has been linked principally to the gene for the skeletal muscle calcium release channel (RYR1). Two recent reports have identified the 3' transmembrane domain of this gene as a common site for mutations. Two other studies have reported single families that have features of both central core disease and nemaline myopathy (core/rod disease) caused by mutations in RYR1. Screening of the 3' region (exons 93-105) of the RYR1 gene for mutations in 27 apparently unrelated patients with either central core disease or core/rod disease by single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing identified three described and nine novel mutations in 15 patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the human caveolin-3 gene (cav-3) on chromosome 3p25 have been described in limb girdle muscular dystrophy, rippling muscle disease, hyperCKemia, and distal myopathy. Here, we describe the genetic, myopathological, and clinical findings in a large German family harboring a novel heterozygous mutation (GAC-->GAA) in codon 27 of the cav-3 gene. This missense mutation causes an amino acid change from asparagine to glutamate (Asp27Glu) in the N-terminal region of the Cav-3 protein, which leads to a drastic decrease of Cav-3 protein expression in skeletal muscle tissue. In keeping with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, this novel cav-3 mutation was found to cosegregate with neuromuscular involvement in the reported family. Ultrastructural analysis of Cav-3-deficient muscle showed an abnormal folding of the plasma membrane as well as multiple vesicular structures in the subsarcolemmal region. Neurological examination of all nine subjects from three generations harboring the novel cav-3 mutation showed clear evidence of rippling muscle disease. However, only two of these nine patients showed isolated signs of rippling muscle disease without muscle weakness or atrophy, whereas five had additional signs of a distal myopathy and two fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of a coexisting limb girdle muscular dystrophy. These findings indicate that mutations in the human cav-3 gene can lead to different and overlapping clinical phenotypes even within the same family. Different clinical phenotypes in caveolinopathies may be attributed to so far unidentified modifying factors/genes in the individual genetic background of affected patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We have taken advantage of the similarity between human and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mitochondrial tRNA(Leu)(UUR), and of the possibility of transforming yeast mitochondria, to construct yeast mitochondrial mutations in the gene encoding tRNA(Leu)(UUR) equivalent to the human A3243G, C3256T and T3291C mutations that have been found in patients with the neurodegenerative disease MELAS (for mitochondrial 'myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes'). The resulting yeast cells (bearing the equivalent mutations A14G, C26T and T69C) were defective for growth on respiratory substrates, exhibited an abnormal mitochondrial morphology, and accumulated mitochondrial DNA deletions at a very high rate, a trait characteristic of severe mitochondrial defects in protein synthesis. This effect was specific at least in the pathogenic mutation T69C, because when we introduced A or G instead of C, the respiratory defect was absent or very mild. All defective phenotypes returned to normal when the mutant cells were transformed by multicopy plasmids carrying the gene encoding the mitochondrial elongation factor EF-Tu. The ability to create and analyse such mutated strains and to select correcting genes should make yeast a good model for the study of tRNAs and their interacting partners and a practical tool for the study of pathological mutations and of tRNA sequence polymorphisms.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked myotubular myopathy is characterised by neonatal hypotonia, muscle weakness and respiratory distress in affected males, leading often to early death, although prolonged survival is observed in milder forms, or as a result of prolongation of ventilation support. It is caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene, which encodes a phosphatase called myotubularin, which has been highly conserved during evolution, down to yeasts ( S. cerevisiae and S. pombe). To date, 251 mutations have been identified in unrelated families, corresponding to 158 different disease-associated mutations, which are widespread throughout the gene. We have found additional mutations in 77 patients, including 35 novel ones. We identified a missense mutation N180K in a 67-year-old grandfather (the oldest known patient with an MTM1 mutation), previously suspected to have autosomal centronuclear myopathy, and in his two grandsons also mildly affected. Mild and moderate phenotypes associated with novel missense mutations and with a translation initiation defect mutation are discussed, as well as severe phenotypes associated with particular novel mutations. With the present report, 192 different mutations in the MTM1 gene have been described in 328 families. The spectrum of mutations is now enlarged from the very severe classic neonatal phenotype to very mild phenotype allowing survival to the age of 67 years.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy (HIBM) is a unique group of neuromuscular disorders characterized by adult onset and a typical muscle pathology. We have recently identified the gene encoding for a bifunctional enzyme, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2 epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE), as the mutated gene in the prototype form of the disease presenting quadriceps sparing, particularly common in Middle Eastern Jews. Interestingly, we have identified the homozygous M712T Middle Eastern Jewish mutation also in two unrelated Middle Eastern Moslem families. We have also evaluated the involvement of GNE in several families from worldwide non-Jewish ethnic origins presenting symptoms similar to the Middle Eastern HIBM prototype. A total of 14 GNE mutations were identified (one nonsense and 13 missense), of which six are novel: an homozygous missense mutation in a consanguineous family from Italy and in a non consanguineous family from USA, and distinct compound heterozygotes in families from Germany, Italy, Ireland, Bahamas, USA and East India. This study brings to 17 the number of reported GNE mutations in quadriceps sparing myopathy, occurring either in the epimerase or the kinase domain of the enzyme. The mechanism leading to this unique phenotype still remains to be elucidated.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Filamin C is the muscle isoform of a group of large actin-crosslinking proteins. On the one hand, filamin C is associated with the Z-disk of the myofibrillar apparatus and binds to myotilin; on the other hand, it interacts with the sarcoglycan complex at the sarcolemma. Filamin C may be involved in reorganizing the cytoskeleton in response to signalling events and in muscle it may, in addition, fulfill structural functions at the Z-disk. An examination of biopsies from patients with multi-minicore myopathy, central core myopathy and neurogenic target fibers with core-like target formations (TF) revealed strong reactivity of all the cores and target formations with two different anti-filamin C antibodies. In all three conditions, the immunoreactivity in the cores for filamin C was considerably stronger than that for desmin. Only for alphaB-crystallin were comparable levels of immunoreactivity detected. There was no difference in intensity for filamin C between the three pathological conditions. Thus, filamin C along with alphaB-crystallin is a strong and robust, but nonspecific marker of core formation. The reason why filamin C accumulates in cores is unclear at present, but we postulate that it may be critically involved in the chain of events eventually leading to myofibrillar degeneration.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Analysis for GNE mutations was performed in an American, non-Iranian Jewish, family with quadriceps-sparing inclusion body myopathy (QS-IBM) and in 11 patients with sporadic IBM (s-IBM). Two novel nonallosteric site missense mutations were found in the QS-IBM kinship. No mutations were identified in s-IBM patients. After 8 years of follow-up and severe disease progression, the quadriceps muscle in the QS-IBM patient remains strong despite subclinical involvement documented with repeat MRI and muscle biopsy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV) is an autosomal-recessive disorder with preferential involvement of the tibialis anterior muscle that starts in young adulthood and spares quadriceps muscles. The disease locus has been mapped to chromosome 9p1-q1, the same region as the hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM) locus. HIBM was originally described as rimmed vacuole myopathy sparing the quadriceps; therefore, the two diseases have been suspected to be allelic. Recently, HIBM was shown to be associated with the mutations in the gene encoding the bifunctional enzyme, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE). OBJECTIVE: To determine whether DMRV and HIBM are allelic. METHODS: The GNE gene was sequenced in 34 patients with DMRV. The epimerase activity in lymphocytes from eight DMRV patients was also measured. RESULTS: The authors identified 27 unrelated DMRV patients with homozygous or compound-heterozygous mutations in the GNE gene. DMRV patients had markedly decreased epimerase activity. CONCLUSIONS: DMRV is allelic to HIBM. Various mutations are associated with DMRV in Japan. The loss-of-function mutations in the GNE gene appear to cause DMRV/HIBM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>AlphaB-crystallin is a small heat-shock protein in which three serine residues (positions 19, 45, and 59) can be phosphorylated under various conditions. We describe here the interaction of alphaB-crystallin with FBX4, an F-box-containing protein that is a component of the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase SCF (SKP1/CUL1/F-box). The interaction with FBX4 was enhanced by mimicking phosphorylation of alphaB-crystallin at both Ser-19 and Ser-45 (S19D/S45D), but not at other combinations. Ser-19 and Ser-45 are preferentially phosphorylated during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Also alphaB-crystallin R120G, a mutant found to co-segregate with a desmin-related myopathy, displayed increased interaction with FBX4. Both alphaB-crystallin S19D/S45D and R120G specifically translocated FBX4 to the detergent-insoluble fraction and stimulated the ubiquitination of one or a few yet unknown proteins. These findings implicate the involvement of alphaB-crystallin in the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway in a phosphorylation- and cell cycle-dependent manner and may provide new insights into the alphaB-crystallin-induced aggregation in desmin-related myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We describe an atypical case of nemaline myopathy with an unusual distribution of muscle weakness who presented at 14 years of age with kyphoscoliosis. In this patient, we demonstrate heterozygosity for a de novo CGT-CAT (Arg167His) mutation in a constitutively expressed exon (exon 5) of slow alpha-tropomyosin (TPM3). This is the first mutation identified in a constitutively expressed exon of TPM3 in a nemaline myopathy patient, but is similar to recently described mutations in beta-tropomyosin (TPM2) associated with nemaline myopathy and mutations in fast alpha-tropomyosin (TPM1) which cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked myotubular myopathy is a severe congenital myopathy in males, caused by mutations in the myotubularin (MTM1) gene on chromosome Xq28. In heterozygous carriers of MTM1 mutations, clinical symptoms are usually absent or only mild. We report a 6-year-old girl presenting at birth with marked hypotonia and associated feeding and respiratory difficulties. A muscle biopsy performed at 5 months suggested a diagnosis of myotubular myopathy. On examination at 6 years she had marked facial weakness with bilateral ptosis and external ophthalmoplegia, severe axial and proximal weakness and a mild scoliosis. Muscle magnetic resonance imaging showed a distinctive pattern of muscle involvement. Molecular genetic investigation of the MTM1 gene identified a heterozygous mutation in exon 12. X-inactivation studies in lymphocytes showed an extremely skewed pattern (97:3). This case emphasizes that investigation of the MTM1 gene and X-inactivation studies are indicated in isolated females with histopathological and clinical findings suggestive of myotubular myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We have generated an animal model for mitochondrial myopathy by disrupting the gene for mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) in skeletal muscle of the mouse. The knockout animals developed a myopathy with ragged-red muscle fibers, accumulation of abnormally appearing mitochondria, and progressively deteriorating respiratory chain function in skeletal muscle. Enzyme histochemistry, electron micrographs, and citrate synthase activity revealed a substantial increase in mitochondrial mass in skeletal muscle of the myopathy mice. Biochemical assays demonstrated that the increased mitochondrial mass partly compensated for the reduced function of the respiratory chain by maintaining overall ATP production in skeletal muscle. The increased mitochondrial mass thus was induced by the respiratory chain deficiency and may be beneficial by improving the energy homeostasis in the affected tissue. Surprisingly, in vitro experiments to assess muscle function demonstrated that fatigue development did not occur more rapidly in myopathy mice, suggesting that overall ATP production is sufficient. However, there were lower absolute muscle forces in the myopathy mice, especially at low stimulation frequencies. This reduction in muscle force is likely caused by deficient formation of force-generating actin-myosin cross bridges and/or disregulation of Ca(2+) homeostasis. Thus, both biochemical measurements of ATP-production rate and in vitro physiological studies suggest that reduced mitochondrial ATP production might not be as critical for the pathophysiology of mitochondrial myopathy as thought previously.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Recently, mutations in the gene encoding for the bi-functional enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE/MNK), symbol GNE or GLCNE (MIM: 603824) [EC 5.1.3.14], were associated with IBM2 (MIM: 600737). IBM2 is a recessively inherited vacuolar myopathy with a prevalence rate of 1-2/1000 amongst people of Iranian-Jewish descent. Seven missense mutations were previously described by Eisenberg et al. All families tested from Iranian and Middle Eastern Jewish ancestry have the same homozygous mutation (bp2186t>c). Here we review the mutations in GNE associated with IBM2, and we describe additional four mutations found in individuals suffering from clinically similar disorder who are not of Iranian or Jewish descent. These findings further confirm that homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations of GNE/MNK gene associated with IBM2 are not confined to any single specific region of the enzyme outside its negative feedback regulatory domain located at codons 249-275.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Although many lysosomal disorders are corrected by a small amount of the missing enzyme, it has been generally accepted that 20-30% of normal acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) activity, provided by gene or enzyme replacement therapy, would be required to reverse the myopathy and cardiomyopathy in Pompe disease. We have addressed the issue of reversibility of the disease in the Gaa(-/-) mouse model. We have made transgenic lines expressing human GAA in skeletal and cardiac muscle of Gaa(-/-) mice, and we turned the transgene on at different stages of disease progression by using a tetracycline-controllable system. We have demonstrated that levels of 20-30% of normal activity are indeed sufficient to clear glycogen in the heart of young Gaa(-/-) mice, but not in older mice with a considerably higher glycogen load. However, in skeletal muscle-a major organ affected in infantile and in milder, late-onset variants in humans-induction of GAA expression in young Gaa(-/-) mice to levels greatly exceeding wildtype values did not result in full phenotypic correction, and some muscle fibers showed little or no glycogen clearance. The results demonstrate that complete reversal of pathology in skeletal muscle or long-affected heart muscle will require much more enzyme than previously expected or a different approach.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Systemic carnitine deficiency (CDSP) (McKusick 212140) is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by defective plasma membrane uptake of carnitine. The disease is characterized by Reye syndrome, progressive cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, hypoglycaemia and hyperammonaemia. CDSP is a treatable disease provided an early diagnosis is made and prompt treatment with L-carnitine is initiated. The biochemical diagnosis of the disease is based on the findings of very low plasma and tissue carnitine concentrations. Recently, a human gene, SLC22A5, encoding a sodium-dependent high-affinity carnitine transporter OCTN2 was cloned from human kidney and shown to be mutated in systemic carnitine deficiency. Here we report two unrelated Saudi CDSP patients who were detected by tandem mass spectrometric analysis (MS/MS) of blood spots. Studies in skin fibroblasts from the two patients showed a severely reduced carnitine uptake. Subsequent molecular studies led to the identification of two novel missense mutations in the OCTN2 gene in the two patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Herein, we report a new case of Danon's disease in a 41-year-old Frenchman. This patient displays the typical clinical triad, with cardiomyopathy, mental retardation and myopathy, and a vacuolar myopathy without acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency. He has also developed a diffuse chorio-capillary ocular atrophy, and represents the second case of successful heart transplantation in this lysosomal disease. Interestingly, analysis of LAMP-2 protein expression in cultured fibroblasts revealed a primary deficiency of this lysosomal membrane protein. This defect resulted from a yet undescribed deletion in exon 7 of lamp-2 gene.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome (MDS) is an autosomal recessive disorder of early childhood characterized by decreased mtDNA copy number in affected tissues. Recently, MDS has been linked to mutations in two genes involved in deoxyribonucleotide (dNTP) metabolism: thymidine kinase 2 (TK2) and deoxy-guanosine kinase (dGK). Mutations in TK2 have been associated with the myopathic form of MDS, and mutations in dGK with the hepatoencephalopathic form. OBJECTIVES: To further characterize the frequency and clinical spectrum of these mutations, the authors screened 20 patients with myopathic MDS. RESULTS: No patient had dGK gene mutations, but four patients from two families had TK2 mutations. Two siblings were compound heterozygous for a previously reported H90N mutation and a novel T77M mutation. The other siblings harbored a homozygous I22M mutation, and one of them had evidence of lower motor neuron disease. The pathogenicity of these mutations was confirmed by reduced TK2 activity in muscle (28% to 37% of controls). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that the clinical expression of TK2 mutations is not limited to myopathy and that the myopathic form of MDS is genetically heterogeneous.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotubularin is a ubiquitously expressed phosphatase that acts on phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate [PI(3)P], a lipid implicated in intracellular vesicle trafficking and autophagy. It is encoded by the MTM1 gene, which is mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM), a muscular disorder characterized by generalized hypotonia and muscle weakness at birth leading to early death of most affected males. The disease was proposed to result from an arrest in myogenesis, as the skeletal muscle from patients contains hypotrophic fibers with centrally located nuclei that resemble fetal myotubes. To understand the physiopathological mechanism of XLMTM, we have generated mice lacking myotubularin by homologous recombination. These mice are viable, but their lifespan is severely reduced. They develop a generalized and progressive myopathy starting at around 4 weeks of age, with amyotrophy and accumulation of central nuclei in skeletal muscle fibers leading to death at 6-14 weeks. Contrary to expectations, we show that muscle differentiation in knockout mice occurs normally. We provide evidence that fibers with centralized myonuclei originate mainly from a structural maintenance defect affecting myotubularin-deficient muscle rather than a regenerative process. In addition, we demonstrate, through a conditional gene-targeting approach, that skeletal muscle is the primary target of murine XLMTM pathology. These mutant mice represent animal models for the human disease and will be a valuable tool for understanding the physiological role of myotubularin.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mdx mouse, the animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, develops an X-linked recessive inflammatory myopathy with an apparent sustained capacity for muscle regeneration. We analysed whether changes in the skeletal muscle during myonecrosis and regeneration would correlate with functional alterations in peripheral lymphoid tissues. Here we show that during the height of myonecrosis, mdx mice display marked atrophy of peripheral lymph nodes and extensive muscle inflammation. In contrast, enlargement of draining lymph nodes with accumulation of CD4+ CD44+, CD4+ CD25+, CD8+ CD44+ T lymphocytes and type-2 B cells was consistently observed during amelioration of the muscle lesion. In addition, regeneration of the muscular tissue was accompanied by concomitant increase of immunoglobulin-secreting cells in regional lymph nodes and bone marrow. Double immunolabelling analysis revealed intense B cell proliferation and formation of germinal centre in the follicles of dystrophic regional lymph nodes. Furthermore, lymph node cells produced large amounts of IFN-gamma but not IL-4, IL-6 or IL-10 after in vitro mitogen stimulation with Concanavalin A. As these alterations occurred mainly during the recovery period, we suggested that local activation of the immune system could be an influence which mitigates the myonecrosis of muscular tissue in the mdx dystrophic mouse.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We investigated distribution of HLA class II alleles among 52 unrelated patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (25 consecutive men, 27 consecutive women, mean age 38 +/-16 years) to determine if there is any immunogenetic predisposition to the disease. DCM was diagnosed according to WHO criteria. HLA-DR and DQ alleles were examined by PCR-SSP typing. Frequency of DRB1* and DQB1* alleles in the study group was compared to local control group (n = 126 for DRB1* and n = 76 for DQB1* alleles). There was a non-significant increase in the frequency of HLA-DRB1*03 (chi square = 4.78, p &lt; 0.05, p corrected for multiple comparisons (pcorr)--NS) and HLA-DQB1*02 (chi square = 4.92, p &lt; 0.05, pcorr--NS) among DCM patients as compared to controls. Frequency of DRB1*04 allele was lower than expected (chi square = 4.58, p &lt; 0.05, pcorr--NS). DRB1*03 is associated with several autoimmune diseases, of interest it confers risk for idiopathic myopathy in Polish patients. Heterozygosity for DRB1*03/DRB1*04, known for association with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was found in 3 patients (5.7%), two of them had adult-onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. There was a tendency to overrepresentation of DRB1*08 among men with DCM. In conclusion, these data give some support for autoimmune involvement in the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the major indication for heart transplantation. Approximately 30% of all DCM is thought to be inherited, while 70% is sporadic. Mutations in the dystrophin gene have been associated with the uncommon X-linked form of DCM. We hypothesized that missense mutations and other less severe mutations of the dystrophin gene might predispose to the common form of sporadic DCM. To test this hypothesis, 22kb of genomic dystrophin DNA was scanned with DOVAM-S in each of the 22 patients with sporadic DCM, including all 79 coding sequences and splice junctions, as well as six alternative exon 1 dystrophin isoforms (484kb, total). Three putative new mutations (IVS5+1 G>T, K18N, and F3228L) and seven polymorphisms were identified. The splice site mutation IVS5+1 is predicted to cause skipping of exon 5, which is within a region containing an actin binding site. The missense mutations occur at amino acids that display substantial evolutionary conservation. Screening of 236 control individuals failed to identify these three mutations. The three patients with putative mutations had CK-MM (creatine kinase, skeletal muscle) levels greater than 250 units while the 14 patients without mutations for which CK-MM were available had values ranging from 20 to 200. The first comprehensive mutation scanning of the exons and splice junctions of the dystrophin gene in patients with sporadic DCM presents the evidence that point mutations are associated with sporadic DCM without clinical evidence of skeletal myopathy. It may be prudent to measure CK-MM in all patients with dilated cardiomyopathy to identify candidates at high risk for dystrophin mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to perform comprehensive mutation analysis of the dystrophin gene in patients with X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy (XLCM). BACKGROUND: X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy is a familial disease that is characterized by congestive heart failure without clinical signs of skeletal myopathy. Mutations in the dystrophin gene have been associated with the X-linked form of dilated cardiomyopathy. However, the fraction of XLCM with dystrophin mutations and the distribution of those mutations is not clear. Technical difficulties previously limited comprehensive mutation analysis of this very large gene. METHODS: The Detection Of Virtually All Mutations-Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) (DOVAM-S), a robotically enhanced multiplexed scanning method that is a highly sensitive modification of SSCP, has successfully detected all of 240 mutations and polymorphisms in three blinded analyses of the factor VIII, factor IX, and ATM genes. Utilizing this method all 79 coding exons and splice junctions for the muscle dystrophin gene, along with six alternative exon 1 sequences, were scanned in eight patients with XLCM. RESULTS: This is the first comprehensive scanning of the dystrophin gene in XLCM. Three of eight patients have putative mutations, including two splicing mutations and a missense mutation at a highly conserved amino acid. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations within the coding regions and splice junctions in the dystrophin gene only account for some cases of XLCM. Genetic heterogeneity and/or undetected mutations in auxiliary regulatory regions or deep within introns may occur in XLCM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV) is an autosomal recessive muscular disorder characterized by weakness of the anterior compartment of the lower limbs with onset in early adulthood and sparing of the quadricep muscles. The UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene was recently identified as the causative gene for hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM). To investigate whether DMRV and HIBM are allelic diseases, we conducted mutational analysis of the GNE gene of six Japanese DMRV pedigrees and found that all the pedigrees share a homozygous mutation (V572L) associated with a strong linkage disequilibrium, suggesting a strong founder effect in Japanese DMRV pedigrees.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We recently reported a severe deficiency in collagen type VI, resulting from recessive mutations of the COL6A2 gene, in patients with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy. Their parents, who are all carriers of one mutant allele, are unaffected, although heterozygous mutations in collagen VI caused Bethlem myopathy. Here we investigated the consequences of three COL6A2 mutations in fibroblasts from patients and their parents in two Ullrich families. All three mutations lead to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. However, very low levels of undegraded mutant mRNA remained in patient B with compound heterozygous mutations at the distal part of the triple-helical domain, resulting in deposition of abnormal microfibrils that cannot form extensive networks. This observation suggests that the C-terminal globular domain is not essential for triple-helix formation but is critical for microfibrillar assembly. In all parents, the COL6A2 mRNA levels are reduced to 57-73% of the control, but long term collagen VI matrix depositions are comparable with that of the control. The almost complete absence of abnormal protein and near-normal accumulation of microfibrils in the parents may account for their lack of myopathic symptoms.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The myotubularin-related 1 (MTMR1) gene belongs to a highly conserved family of eucaryotic phosphatases, with at least 11 members in humans. The founder member of this gene family, MTM1, is mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy, a severe congenital disorder that affects skeletal muscle, and codes for myotubularin, a specific phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PI(3)P] phosphatase. MTM1 and MTMR1 are adjacent on the X chromosome, and the corresponding proteins share 59% sequence identity. In the present study, we investigated the putative role of MTMR1 in myogenesis by analysing its expression pattern in muscle cells during differentiation and in skeletal muscle throughout development. We have identified three novel coding exons in the MTMR1 intron 2 that are conserved between mouse and human, are alternatively spliced, and give rise to six mRNA isoforms. One of the transcripts is muscle-specific and is induced during myogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, and represents the major isoform in adult skeletal muscle. We show that the two main MTMR1 protein muscular isoforms, like myotubularin, efficiently dephosphorylate PI(3)P in vitro. We have also analysed whether MTMR1 alternative splicing is affected in skeletal muscle cells derived from patients with congenital myotonic dystrophy (cDM1), in which mRNA splicing disturbances of specific genes are thought to constitute an important pathogenic mechanism. We found a striking reduction in the level of the muscle-specific isoform and the appearance of an abnormal MTMR1 transcript in differentiated cDM1 muscle cells in culture and in skeletal muscle from cDM1 patients. Our results suggest that MTMR1 plays a role in muscle formation and represents a novel target for abnormal mRNA splicing in myotonic dystrophy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR1) gene are associated with Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) and Central Core Disease (CCD). We report here on the molecular analysis of the RYR1 gene in Italian families referred as potential cases of MH or in patients with CCD or multicore/minicore myopathy. Of a total of 20 individuals with mutations in the RYR1 gene, 14 were part of a group of 47 MH susceptible (MHS) patients, 4 of 34 individuals diagnosed as MH equivocal (MHE), and 2 were patients diagnosed with minicore myopathy and CCD, respectively. Mutations were found to segregate with the MHS or MHE phenotype within the families of the probands. A discordance between phenotype and genotype was observed in a family where a mutation detected in an MHS proband was also found in the father who had been diagnosed MH normal (MHN) at the IVCT. In addition to known mutations, seven novel mutations were found, five of which occurred in exons encoding the C-terminal region of RYR1. These results indicate that the C-terminal region of RYR1 represents an additional hot spot for mutations in patients with MH, similar to what has been reported for patients with CCD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Previously, we reported results indicating that nebulin was the gene causing the typical form of autosomal recessive nemaline (rod) myopathy. Here we describe the identification of mutations in the nebulin gene in seven offspring of five families affected by the severe congenital form of nemaline myopathy. One pregnancy was terminated on the grounds of foetal abnormality, while six affected infants died at ages ranging from the first day of life to 19 months. Only three of the six neonates were able to establish spontaneous respiration. Three had arthrogryposis. In three of the five families, the mutations were located in exon 184. These mutations are predicted to cause absence of the C-terminal part of nebulin.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The alpha-tropomyosin-3 (TPM3) gene was screened in 40 unrelated patients with nemaline myopathy (NM). A single compound heterozygous patient was identified carrying one mutation that converts the stop codon to a serine and a second splicing mutation that is predicted to prevent inclusion of skeletal muscle exon IX. TPM3 mutations are a rare cause of NM, probably accounting for less than 3% of cases. The severity of cases with TPM3 mutations may vary from severe infantile to late childhood onset, slowly progressive forms.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Multiminicore disease (MmD) is an autosomal recessive congenital myopathy characterized by the presence of multiple, short core lesions (known as "minicores") in most muscle fibers. MmD is a clinically heterogeneous condition, in which four subgroups have been distinguished. Homozygous RYR1 mutations have been recently identified in the moderate form of MmD with hand involvement. The genes responsible for the three other forms (including the most prevalent phenotype, termed the "classical" phenotype) remained, so far, unknown. To further characterize the genetic basis of MmD, we analyzed a series of 62 patients through a combined positional/candidate-gene approach. On the basis of clinical and morphological data, we suspected a relationship between classical MmD and the selenoprotein N gene (SEPN1), which is located on chromosome 1p36 (RSMD1 locus) and is responsible for the congenital muscular dystrophy with rigid spine syndrome (RSMD). A genomewide screening, followed by the analysis of 1p36 microsatellite markers in 27 informative families with MmD, demonstrated linkage to RSMD1 in eight families. All showed an axial myopathy with scoliosis and respiratory failure, consistent with the most severe end of the classical MmD spectrum; spinal rigidity was evident in some, but not all, patients. We excluded linkage to RSMD1 in 19 families with MmD, including 9 with classical MmD. Screening of SEPN1 in the 8 families that showed linkage and in 14 patients with classical sporadic disease disclosed 9 mutations affecting 17 patients (12 families); 6 were novel mutations, and 3 had been described in patients with RSMD. Analysis of three deltoid biopsy specimens from patients with typical RSMD revealed a wide myopathological variability, ranging from a dystrophic to a congenital myopathy pattern. A variable proportion of minicores was found in all the samples. The present study represents the first identification of a gene responsible for classical MmD, demonstrates its genetic heterogeneity, and reassesses the nosological boundaries between MmD and RSMD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Tibial muscular dystrophy (TMD) is an autosomal dominant late-onset distal myopathy linked to chromosome 2q31. The linked region includes the giant TTN gene, which encodes the central sarcomeric protein, titin. We have previously shown a secondary calpain-3 defect to be associated with TMD, which further underscored that titin is the candidate. We now report the first mutations in TTN to cause a human skeletal-muscle disease, TMD. In Mex6, the last exon of TTN, a unique 11-bp deletion/insertion mutation, changing four amino acid residues, completely cosegregated with all tested 81 Finnish patients with TMD in 12 unrelated families. The mutation was not found in 216 Finnish control samples. In a French family with TMD, a Leu-->Pro mutation at position 293,357 in Mex6 was discovered. Mex6 is adjacent to the known calpain-3 binding site Mex5 of M-line titin. Immunohistochemical analysis using two exon-specific antibodies directed to the M-line region of titin demonstrated the specific loss of carboxy-terminal titin epitopes in the TMD muscle samples that we studied, thus implicating a functional defect of the M-line titin in the genesis of the TMD disease phenotype.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myoblasts respond to growth factor deprivation either by differentiating into multinucleated myotubes or by undergoing apoptosis; hence, the acquisition of apoptosis resistance by myogenic precursors is essential for their development. Here we demonstrate that the expression of the small heat shock protein alpha B-crystallin is selectively induced in C2C12 myoblasts that are resistant to differentiation-induced apoptosis, and we show that this induction occurs at an early stage in their differentiation in vitro. In contrast, the expression of several known anti-apoptotic proteins (FLIP, XIAP, Bcl-x(L)) was not altered during myogenesis. We also demonstrate that ectopic expression of alpha B-crystallin, but not the closely related small heat shock protein Hsp27, renders C2C12 myoblasts resistant to differentiation-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that the myopathy-causing R120G alpha B-crystallin mutant is partly impaired in its cytoprotective function, whereas a pseudophosphorylation alpha B-crystallin mutant that mimics stress-induced phosphorylation is completely devoid of anti-apoptotic activity. Finally, we demonstrate that alpha B-crystallin negatively regulates apoptosis during myogenesis by inhibiting the proteolytic activation of caspase-3, whereas the R120G and pseudophosphorylation mutants are defective in this function. Taken together, our findings indicate that alpha B-crystallin is a novel negative regulator of myogenic apoptosis that directly links the differentiation program to apoptosis resistance.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A novel human transcript, C9orf19, mapped to the genomic region involved in hereditary inclusion body myopathy (IBM2) at chromosome 9p12-p13, has been cloned and characterized. A single cDNA clone consisting of the full-length 1.9 kb transcript has been isolated from a human placenta cDNA library and further analyzed. Genomic characterization of the C9orf19 gene identified five exons extending over 27.2 kb of genomic DNA, located 12 kb centromeric to the tumor suppressor RECK gene. C9orf19 mRNA is expressed in a wide range of adult tissues as a single transcript, most abundantly in lung and peripheral blood leukocytes. The predicted protein contains the SCP-like extracellular protein signature classified to IPR001283, a family of evolutionary related proteins with extracellular domains, which includes the human glioma pathogenesis-related protein (GliPR), the human testis specific glycoprotein (TPX-1), and several other extracellular proteins from rodents (SCP), insects venom allergens (Ag5, Ag3), plants pathogenesis proteins (PR-1) and yeast hypothetical proteins. Homology searches with the deduced 154 amino acid protein sequence of C9orf19 revealed highly similar proteins in mouse, drosophila, nematode and yeast. Mutation analysis of C9orf19 in IBM2 patients excluded it as the disease causing gene and revealed four single nucleotide polymorphisms within and in the vicinity of the gene, which will certainly be useful tools to study its potential role in several human diseases mapped to chromosome 9p12-p13. Parallel to this study, the gene termed GNE, approximately 50 kb centromeric to C9orf19, was shown to be the disease causing gene in IBM2.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Central core disease (CCD) is a congenital myopathy due to dominant mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1). The authors report three patients from two consanguineous families with symptoms of a congenital myopathy, cores on muscle biopsy, and confirmed linkage to the RYR1 locus. Molecular genetic studies in one family identified a V4849I homozygous missense mutation in the RYR1 gene. This report suggests a congenital myopathy associated with recessive RYR1 mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: As part of a larger, worldwide study of the ethnogeography of myositis, we evaluated the clinical, serologic, and immunogenetic features of Mestizo (Mexican and Guatemalan) and North American Caucasian patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM). METHODS: Clinical manifestations, autoantibodies, HLA-DRB1 and DQA1 alleles, and immunoglobulin Gm/Km allotypes were compared between 138 Mestizos with IIM and 287 Caucasians with IIM, using the same classification criteria and standardized questionnaires. RESULTS: IIM in Mestizo patients was characterized by a higher proportion of dermatomyositis (69% of adult Mestizos versus 35% of adult Caucasians; P &lt; 0.001) and anti-Mi-2 autoantibodies (30% versus 7% of adults, respectively, and 32% versus 4% of children, respectively; P &lt; 0.01). Genetic risk factors also differed in these populations. Whereas Mestizos had no HLA risk factors for IIM, HLA-DRB1*0301, the linked allele DQA1*0501, and DRB1 alleles sharing the first hypervariable region motif (9)EYSTS(13) were major risk factors in Caucasian patients with IIM. Furthermore, different HLA-DRB1 and DQA1 alleles were associated with anti-Mi-2 autoantibodies (DRB1*04 and DQA1*03 in Mestizos and DRB1*07 and DQA1*02 in Caucasians). Immunoglobulin gamma-chain allotypes Gm(1), Gm(17) (odds ratio for both 11.3, P = 0.008), and Gm(21) (odds ratio 7.3, P = 0.005) and kappa-chain allotype Km(3) (odds ratio 7.3, P = 0.005) were risk factors for IIM in Mestizos; however, no Gm or Km allotypes were risk or protective factors in Caucasians. In addition, Gm and Km phenotypes were unique risk factors (Gm 1,3,17 5,13,21 and Gm 1,17 23 21 and Km 3,3) or protective factors (Km 1,1) for the development of myositis and anti-Mi-2 autoantibodies (Gm 1,2,3,17 23 5,13,21) in adult Mestizos. CONCLUSION: IIM in Mesoamerican Mestizos differs from IIM in North American Caucasians in the frequency of phenotypic features and in the immune-response genes predisposing to and protecting from myositis and anti-Mi-2 autoantibodies at 4 chromosomal loci. These and other data suggest the likelihood that the expression of IIM is modulated by different genes and environmental exposures around the world.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotubularin, the phosphatase mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy, was shown to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate (PtdIns3P) and was also reported to interact with nuclear transcriptional regulators from the trithorax family. We have characterized a panel of specific antibodies and investigated the subcellular localization of myotubularin. Myotubularin is not detected in the nucleus, and localizes mostly as a dense cytoplasmic network. Overexpression of myotubularin does not detectably affect vesicle trafficking in the mammalian cells investigated, in contrast to previous observations in yeast models. Both mutation of a key aspartate residue of myotubularin and dominant activation of Rac1 GTPase lead to the recruitment of myotubularin to specific plasma membrane domains. Localization to Rac1-induced ruffles is dependent on the presence of a domain highly conserved in the myotubularin family (that we named RID). We thus propose that myotubularin may dephosphorylate a subpool of PtdIns3P (or another related substrate) at the plasma membrane.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myoadenylate deaminase deficiency is the most common metabolic disorder of skeletal muscle in the Caucasian population, affecting approximately 2% of all individuals. Although most deficient subjects are asymptomatic, some suffer from exercise-induced myalgia suggesting a causal relationship between a lack of enzyme activity and muscle function. In addition, carriers of this derangement in purine nucleotide catabolism may have an adaptive advantage related to clinical outcome in heart disease. The molecular basis of myoadenylate deaminase deficiency in Caucasians has been attributed to a single mutant allele characterized by double C to T transitions at nucleotides +34 and +143 in mRNA encoded by the AMPD1 gene. Polymerase chain reaction-based strategies have been developed to specifically identify this common mutant allele and are considered highly sensitive. Consequently, some laboratories preferentially use this technique over other available diagnostic tests for myoadenylate deaminase deficiency. We previously identified a G468-T mutation in one symptomatic patient who was only heterozygous for the common AMPD1 mutant allele. In this report, nine additional individuals with this compound heterozygous genotype are revealed in a survey of 48 patients with documented deficiency of skeletal muscle adenosine monophosphate deaminase and exercise-induced myalgia. Western blot analysis of leftover biopsy material from one of these individuals does not detect any immunoreactive myoadenylate deaminase polypeptide. Baculoviral expression of the G468-T mutant allele produces a Q156H substitution enzyme exhibiting labile catalytic activity. These combined results demonstrate that the G468-T transversion is dysfunctional and further indicate that AMPD1 alleles harboring this mutation contribute to the high incidence of partial and complete myoadenylate deaminase deficiency in the Caucasian population. Consequently, genetic tests for abnormal AMPD1 expression designed to diagnose patients with metabolic myopathy, and to evaluate genetic markers for clinical outcome in heart disease should not be based solely on the detection of a single mutant allele.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Multi-minicore disease is an autosomal recessive congenital myopathy characterized by the presence of multiple, short-length core lesions (minicores) in both muscle fiber types. These lesions being nonspecific and the clinical phenotype being heterogeneous, multi-minicore disease boundaries remain unclear. To identify its genetic basis, we performed a genome-wide screening in a consanguineous Algerian family in which three children presented in infancy with moderate weakness predominant in axial muscles, pelvic girdle and hands, joint hyperlaxity (hand involvement phenotype), and multiple minicores. We mapped the disease to chromosome 19q13 in this family and, subsequently, in three additional families showing a similar phenotype, with a maximum LOD score of 5.19 for D19S570. This locus was excluded in 16 other multi-minicore disease families with predominantly axial weakness, scoliosis, and respiratory insufficiency ("classical" phenotype). In the Algerian family, we identified a novel homozygous missense mutation (P3527S) in the ryanodine receptor type 1 gene, a positional candidate gene responsible for the autosomal dominant congenital myopathy central core disease. New muscle biopsies from the three patients at adulthood demonstrated typical central core disease with rods; no cores were found in the healthy parents. This subgroup of families linked to 19q13 represents the first variant of central core disease with genetically proven recessive inheritance and transient presentation as multi-minicore disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) is a lysosomal enzyme that degrades glycogen. A deficiency of GAA is responsible for a recessively inherited myopathy and cardiomyopathy, glycogenosis type II. Previously, we identified an intronic repressor element in the GAA gene and demonstrated that Hes-1, a basic helix-loop-helix factor, binds to a C class E box within the element and functions as a transcriptional repressor in HepG2 cells. Hes-1 is a well studied downstream target gene in the Notch signaling pathway. In this study, over-expression and depletion of Notch-1 intracellular domain (NICD) strategies were used to investigate whether expression of the GAA gene is under the control of Notch-1/Hes-1 signaling. In co-transfection experiments, Hes-1, up-regulated by over-expressed NICD, enhanced the repressive effect of the DNA element with wild type Hes-1 binding sites but not with mutant Hes-1 binding sites. Conversely, depletion of Notch-1 with phosphorothioated antisense oligonucleotides, corresponding to the fourth ankyrin repeat within NICD, led to reduced Hes-1. Constitutively over-expressed Hes-1 and Notch-1 repressed GAA gene expression. Therefore, our data establish that the human GAA gene, encoding a lysosomal enzyme, is a downstream target of the Notch-1/Hes-1 signaling pathway.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Duchenne muscular dystrophy is one of the most common neuromuscular diseases. It is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Dystrobrevins are dystrophin-associated proteins potentially involved in signal transduction. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans possesses one dystrophin-like (dys-1) and one dystrobrevin-like (dyb-1) gene. Mutations of dyb-1 and dys-1 lead to similar phenotypes, comprising hyperactivity and a tendency to hypercontract, which suggest that these proteins may participate in a common function. We show here that overexpression of the Dyb-1 protein delays the onset of the myopathy observed in the C. elegans double mutant (dys-1; hlh-1 mutations). This finding indicates that, in C. elegans, (1) the absence of dystrophin can be partly compensated for by extra doses of dystrobrevin, and (2) dystrobrevin is partly functional in absence of dystrophin.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>To investigate the role of integrin alpha 7 in muscle pathology, we used a "candidate gene" approach in a large cohort of muscular dystrophy/myopathy patients. Antibodies against the intracellular domain of the integrin alpha 7A and alpha 7B were used to stain muscle biopsies from 210 patients with muscular dystrophy/myopathy of unknown etiology. Levels of alpha 7A and alpha 7B integrin were found to be decreased in 35 of 210 patients (approximately 17%). In six of these patients no integrin alpha 7B was detected. Screening for alpha 7B mutation in 30 of 35 patients detected only one integrin alpha 7 missense mutation (the mutation on the second allele was not found) in a patient presenting with a congenital muscular dystrophy-like phenotype. No integrin alpha 7 gene mutations were identified in all of the other patients showing integrin alpha 7 deficiency. In the process of mutation analysis, we identified a novel integrin alpha 7 isoform presenting 72-bp deletion. This isoform results from a partial deletion of exon 21 due to the use of a cryptic splice site generated by a G to A missense mutation at nucleotide position 2644 in integrin alpha 7 cDNA. This spliced isoform is present in about 12% of the chromosomes studied. We conclude that secondary integrin alpha 7 deficiency is rather common in muscular dystrophy/myopathy of unknown etiology, emphasizing the multiple mechanisms that may modulate integrin function and stability.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the gene encoding myotubularin-related protein 2 (MTMR2) are responsible for autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B1 (CMT4B1), a severe hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy characterized by focally folded myelin sheaths and demyelination. MTMR2 belongs to the myotubularin family, which is characterized by the presence of a phosphatase domain. Myotubularin (MTM), the archetype member of this family, is mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy. Although MTMR2 and MTM are closely related, they are likely to have different functions. Recent studies revealed that MTM dephosphorylates specifically phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. Here we analyze the biochemical properties of the mouse Mtmr2 protein, which shares 97% amino acid identity with human MTMR2. We show that phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate is also a substrate for Mtmr2, but, unlike myotubularin, Mtmr2 dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate with high efficiency and peak activity at neutral pH. We demonstrate that the known disease-associated MTMR2 mutations lead to dramatically reduced phosphatase activity, suggesting that the MTMR2 phosphatase activity is crucial for the proper function of peripheral nerves in CMT4B1. Expression analysis of Mtmr2 suggests particularly high levels in neurons. Thus, the demyelinating neuropathy CMT4B1 might be triggered by the malfunction of neural membrane recycling, membrane trafficking, and/or endocytic or exocytotic processes, combined with altered axon-Schwann cell interactions. Furthermore, the different biochemical properties of MTM and MTMR2 offer a potential explanation for the different human diseases caused by mutations in their respective genes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Antiretroviral therapy, although successful in reducing HIV load and accordingly decreasing the incidence of HIV infection-related symptoms, has its drawbacks in the form of severe side effects. Recognized drug-related side effects are, for example, nausea, fatigue, lactic acidosis, neuropathy, lipodystrophy, and myopathy. Because not all patients experience these side effects, genetic factors could be involved. It is believed that the main toxicity of nucleoside analog drugs is due to a decrease in mitochondrial function, possibly by inhibition of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication. mtDNA is replicated by a multienzyme complex, the main component of which is the nuclear-encoded DNA polymerase gamma. Presently, the only known variation in the DNA polymerase gamma gene is variation in the number of CAG repeats in the second exon. To investigate whether CAG repeat expansion or mutations in the DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) gene could predispose to peripheral neuropathy or lactic acidosis, we have sequenced part of the second exon of the DNA polymerase gamma gene, containing the CAG repeat, of 59 drug-treated HIV-infected patients, 11 of whom experienced drug-induced neuropathy, and 3 of whom died from lactic acidosis. No correlation was found between numbers of CAG repeats and any of the symptoms. The coding regions of the POLG gene from the three lactic acidosis patients were then completely sequenced, but no mutations were found. In addition, no variation was detected in exons 3, 8, and 19 of seven neuropathy patients and three control subjects without symptoms. These exons were the only sites of amino acid changes between human and chimpanzee POLG genes, and were chosen as targets of tolerated variation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM; OMIM# 310400) is a severe congenital muscle disease caused by mutations in the myotubularin (MTM1) gene. This gene encodes for a lipid phosphatase belonging to a large gene family involved in the regulation of phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathway and membrane trafficking. To date, more than 130 different mutations, distributed in all exons, have been identified in a large number of families. The majority of MTM1 mutations are private and rare, generating high allelic diversity, with a restricted number of recurrent mutations. We set up and formatted a denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) method to allow high throughput, greater accuracy and high resolution in detecting myotubularin mutations. The entire coding sequence of the gene was screened in 10 XLMTM patients using this technique. We identified seven mutated alleles [R37X, (137-11) A, (592-593) insA, T197I, R253X, G378R, G402R] previously characterised by SSCP and DNA sequencing, plus two novel mutations which are reported here [P199S, (1644+2) insG]. In addition we detected a common polymorphism within intron 11 (1314+3A/G). Our results suggest that denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography provides an accurate method for the rapid identification of MTM1 mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in mitochondrial genes encoded by both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA have been implicated in a wide range of degenerative diseases. MtDNA base substitution and rearrangement mutations can cause myopathy, cardiomyopathy, ophthalmological defects, growth retardation, movement disorders, dementias, and diabetes. nDNA mutations can affect mtDNA replication and transcription, increase mtDNA mutations through defects in the adenine nucleotide translocator isoform 1 (ANT1), or cause Leigh's syndrome, as a result of defects in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) structural genes. Mouse models of mtDNA base substitution mutations have been created by introducing the mtDNA 16S rRNA chloramphenicol (CAP)-resistance mutation into the mouse female germline. This resulted in ophthalmological defects in chimeras and perinatal lethality resulting from myopathy and cardiomyopathy in mutant animals. Mouse models of mtDNA rearrangements have resulted in animals with myopathy, cardiomyopathy, and nephropathy. Conditional inactivation of the mouse nDNA mitochondrial transcription factor (Tfam) gene in the heart caused neonatal lethal cardiomyopathy, whereas its inactivation in the pancreatic beta-cells caused diabetes. Mutational inactivation of the mouse Ant1 gene resulted in myopathy, cardiomyopathy, and multiple mtDNA deletions in association with elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. This suggests that multiple mtDNA deletion syndrome can be caused by increased ROS damage. The inactivation of the uncoupler protein genes (Ucp) 1-3 resulted in alterations in delta mu H+ and increased ROS production. Inactivation of the Ucp2 gene, which is expressed in the pancreatic beta-cells, resulted in increased islet ATP, increased serum insulin levels, and suppression of the diabetes of the ob/ob mouse genotype. Transgenic mice with altered beta-cell ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP) also developed diabetes. Mutational inactivation of the mitochondrial antioxidant genes for glutathione peroxidase (GPx1) and Mn superoxide dismutase (Sod2) caused reduced energy production and neonatal lethal dilated cardiomyopathy, respectively, the later being ameliorated by treatment with MnSOD mimics. Partial Sod2 deficiency (+/-) resulted in mice with increased mitochondrial damage during aging, and treatment of C. elegans with catalytic antioxidant drugs can extend their life-span. Mice deficient in cytochrome-c died early in embryogenesis, but cells derived from these embryos had a complete deficiency in mitochondrial apoptosis. Mice lacking the proapoptotic Bax and Bak genes were not able to release cytochrome-c from the mitochondrion and were blocked in apoptosis. Mice lacking Apaf1, Cas9, and Cas3 did release mitochondrial cytochrome-c and were blocked in the downstream steps of apoptosis. These animal studies confirm that alterations in mitochondrial energy generation, ROS production, and apoptosis can all contribute to the pathophysiology of mitochondrial disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The most common autosomal recessive form of nemaline myopathy is due to mutations in the nebulin gene. Among eight patients studied, we identified one, a 14-year-old girl, with a specific pattern of diffuse rods in muscle fibers. Western blot analysis detected absence of the C-terminal domain of nebulin. Protein analysis may represent a good screening method to direct molecular studies in the case of very large and complex genes such as the large 1298 kb nebulin gene.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS), due to a contiguous gene deletion of approximately 1.5 Mb at 7q11.23, is a complex developmental disorder with multisystemic manifestations including supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) and a specific cognitive phenotype. Large repeats containing genes and pseudogenes flank the deletion breakpoints, and the mutation mechanism commonly appears to be unequal meiotic crossover. Except for elastin, hemizygosity of which is associated with supravalvular aortic stenosis, it is unknown which of the 18 genes in the deletion area contributes to the phenotype. Here, we report the identification and characterization of two novel genes, WBSCR20 and WBSCR22, which map to the common WBS deletion region. WBSCR22 encodes a putative methyltransferase protein strongly expressed in heart, skeletal muscle and kidney. WBSCR20 encodes a novel protein expressed in skeletal muscle with similarity to p120 (NOL1), a 120-kDa proliferation-associated nucleolar antigen, a member of an evolutionarily conserved protein family. A highly similar putative gene, WBSCR20B, flanks the WBS deletion at the telomeric side. Hemizygous deletion of either of the novel genes might contribute to the growth retardation, the myopathy or the premature aging effects in the pathogenesis of WBS.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Tropomodulins (Tmods) are tropomyosin (TM) binding proteins that bind to the pointed end of actin filaments and modulate thin filament dynamics. They bind to the N termini of both "long" TMs (with the N terminus encoded by exon 1a of the alpha-TM gene) and "short" nonmuscle TMs (with the N terminus encoded by exon 1b). In this present study, circular dichroism was used to study the interaction of two designed chimeric proteins, AcTM1aZip and AcTM1bZip, containing the N terminus of a long or a short TM, respectively, with protein fragments containing residues 1 to 130 of erythrocyte or skeletal muscle Tmod. The binding of either TMZip causes similar conformational changes in both Tmod fragments promoting increases in both alpha-helix and beta-structure, although they differ in binding affinity. The circular dichroism changes in the Tmod upon binding and modeling of the Tmod sequences suggest that the interface between TM and Tmod includes a three- or four-stranded coiled coil. An intact coiled coil at the N terminus of the TMs is essential for Tmod binding, as modifications that disrupt the N-terminal helix, such as removal of the N-terminal acetyl group from AcTM1aZip or striated muscle alpha-TM, or introduction of a mutation that causes nemaline myopathy, Met-8-Arg, into AcTM1aZip destroyed Tmod binding.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a congenital X-linked myopathy caused by lack of dystrophin protein expression. In DMD, the expression of many dystrophin-associated proteins (DAPs) is reduced along the sarcolemmal membrane, but the same proteins remain concentrated at the neuromuscular junction where utrophin, a dystrophin homologue, is expressed [Matsumura, K., Ervasti, J. M., Ohlendieck, K., Kahl, K. D. &amp; Campbell, K. (1992) Nature (London) 360, 588-591]. This outcome has led to the concept that ectopic expression of a "synaptic scaffold" of DAPs and utrophin along myofibers might compensate for the molecular defects in DMD. Here we show that transgenic overexpression of the synaptic CT GalNAc transferase in the skeletal muscles of mdx animals (mdx/CT) increases the expression of utrophin and many DAPs, including dystroglycans, sarcoglycans, and dystrobrevins, along myofibers. Protein expression of utrophin and DAPs was equal to or above that of wild-type mice. In addition, alpha-dystroglycan was glycosylated with the CT carbohydrate antigen in mdx/CT but not in mdx muscles. mdx/CT mice have little or no evidence of muscular dystrophy by several standard measures; Serum creatine kinase levels, percentage of centrally located myofiber nuclei, and variance in myofiber diameter in mdx/CT muscles were dramatically reduced compared with mdx mice. These data suggest that ectopic expression of the CT GalNAc transferase creates a functional dystrophin-related complex along myofibers in the absence of dystrophin and should be considered as a target for therapeutic intervention in DMD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Perlecan, a large heparan sulfate proteoglycan, is a component of the basement membrane and other extracellular matrices and has been implicated in multiple biological functions. Mutations in the perlecan gene (HSPG2) cause two classes of skeletal disorders: the relatively mild Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS) and severe neonatal lethal dyssegmental dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type (DDSH). SJS is an autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia characterized by varying degrees of myotonia and chondrodysplasia, and patients with SJS survive. The molecular mechanism underlying the chondrodystrophic myotonia phenotype of SJS is unknown. In the present report, we identify five different mutations that resulted in various forms of perlecan in three unrelated patients with SJS. Heterozygous mutations in two patients with SJS either produced truncated perlecan that lacked domain V or significantly reduced levels of wild-type perlecan. The third patient had a homozygous 7-kb deletion that resulted in reduced amounts of nearly full-length perlecan. Unlike DDSH, the SJS mutations result in different forms of perlecan in reduced levels that are secreted to the extracellular matrix and are likely partially functional. These findings suggest that perlecan has an important role in neuromuscular function and cartilage formation, and they define the molecular basis involved in the difference in the phenotypic severity between DDSH and SJS.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Patients with isolated complex I deficiency (CID) in skeletal muscle mitochondria often present with exercise intolerance as their major clinical symptom. OBJECTIVE: To study the in vivo bioenergetics in patients with complex I deficiency in skeletal muscle mitochondria. METHODS: In vivo bioenergetics were studied in three of these patients by measuring oxygen uptake at rest and during maximal exercise, together with forearm ADP concentrations ([ADP]) at rest. Whole-body oxygen consumption at rest (VO(2)) was measured with respiratory calorimetry. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2)max) was measured during maximal exercise on a cycle ergometer. Resting [ADP] was estimated from in vivo (31)P MRS measurements of inorganic phosphate, phosphocreatine, and ATP content of forearm muscle. RESULTS: Resting VO(2) was significantly increased in all three patients: 128 +/-14% (SD) of values in healthy control subjects. VO(2)max in patients was on average 2.8 times their VO(2) at rest and was only 28% of VO(2)max in control subjects. Resting [ADP] in forearm muscle was significantly increased compared with healthy control subjects (patients 26 +/-2 microM, healthy controls 9 +/-2 microM). CONCLUSION: In patients with CID, the increased whole-body oxygen consumption rate at rest reflects increased electron transport through the respiratory chain, driven by a decreased phosphorylation potential. The increased electron transport rate may compensate for the decreased efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation (phosphorylation potential).</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Bethlem myopathy is an early-onset benign myopathy characterized by proximal muscular weakness and multiple flexion contractures. It is a dominantly inherited disorder associated with mutations in the three COL6 genes encoding type VI collagen. We detected a g-->a substitution at +1 position of COL6A1 intron 3 in a four-generation Italian family affected by a mild form of Bethlem myopathy. The mutation results in the activation of a cryptic splice donor site at the 3' end of exon 3, leading to the loss of 66 nucleotides and an "in-frame" deletion of 22 amino acids in the NH2-domain. Molecular analysis on fibroblasts of the propositus showed that the mutated mRNA was present and stable, but the mutated protein could not be detected. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses showed a decreased level of collagen VI synthesis and deposition in fibroblasts of the propositus. Together, the results suggest that the mutated protein was highly unstable and rapidly degraded, and that the mild phenotype was caused by a reduced amount of normal collagen VI microfibrils. In addition, we demonstrated that lymphocytes can be used for the first mutation screening analysis of patients with Bethlem myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>This is the first report on mutations of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase gene (GNE) in Nonaka myopathy or distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (OMIM 605820), an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder. Sequence and haplotype analyses of GNE in two siblings with Nonaka myopathy from a Japanese family revealed that both patients were compound heterozygotes for a C-->T transition (A460V) in exon 8 and a G-->C transition (V572L) in exon 10. Their parents and a normal elder brother were all carriers for one or the other of the mutations. GNE mutations are known to cause two other disorders: sialuria (OMIM #269921) and autosomal recessive inclusion body myopathy (IBM2, OMIM #600737). Mutations associated with sialuria are located in the epimerase domain, and those associated with IBM2 are in the epimerase or the kinase domain or both, whereas the mutations we observed in the Nonaka myopathy patients were located in the sugar kinase domain of the gene. Thus, Nonaka myopathy is the third disease known to be caused by GNE mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Deficiency of the Golgi enzyme UDP-Gal:N-acetylglucosamine beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase I (beta4GalT I) (E.C.2.4.1.38) causes a new congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG), designated type IId (CDG-IId), a severe neurologic disease characterized by a hydrocephalus, myopathy, and blood-clotting defects. Analysis of oligosaccharides from serum transferrin by HPLC, mass spectrometry, and lectin binding revealed the loss of sialic acid and galactose residues. In skin fibroblasts and leukocytes, galactosyltransferase activity was reduced to 5% that of controls. In fibroblasts, a truncated polypeptide was detected that was about 12 kDa smaller in size than wild-type beta4GalT I and that failed to localize to the Golgi apparatus. Sequencing of the beta4GalT I cDNA and gene revealed an insertion of a single nucleotide (1031-1032insC) leading to premature translation stop and loss of the C-terminal 50 amino acids of the enzyme. The patient was homozygous and his parents heterozygous for this mutation. Expression of a corresponding mutant cDNA in COS-7 cells led to the synthesis of a truncated, inactive polypeptide, which localized to the endoplasmic reticulum.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The nuclear lamins form a two-dimensional matrix that provides integrity to the cell nucleus and participates in nuclear activities. Mutations in the region of human LMNA encoding the carboxyl-terminal tail Lamin A/C are associated with forms of muscular dystrophy and familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD). To help discriminate tissue-specific phenotypes, we have solved at 1.4-A resolution the three-dimensional crystal structure of the lamin A/C globular tail. The domain adopts a novel, all beta immunoglobulin-like fold. FPLD-associated mutations cluster within a small surface, whereas muscular dystrophy-associated mutations are distributed throughout the protein core and on its surface. These findings distinguish myopathy- and lipodystrophy-associated mutations and provide a structural framework for further testing hypotheses concerning lamin function.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We found that up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression accompanies, but is not required for, appearance of spontaneous myopathy in SJL/J mice. In some neuromuscular diseases, MHC class I expression is markedly up-regulated in muscles, though the consequences of this up-regulation for pathology are not clear. To study MHC class I in myopathy, we compared muscles of SJL/J mice to muscles of SJL/J mice that were also MHC class I-deficient due to targeted mutation in the beta-2-microglobulin gene (SJL/J B2m (-/-) mice). SJL/J mice show spontaneous myopathy and have a mutation in the dysferlin gene, a gene which is also mutated in human limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B). Muscles of eight-month-old SJL/J mice had higher levels of MHC class I expression than muscles of either C57BL/6J (wild-type) or SJL/J B2m (-/-) mice. In contrast, the percentage of abnormal muscle fibers was similar in SJL/J and SJL/J B2m (-/-) muscles. Invading Mac-1(+) cells were most abundant in SJL/J B2m (-/-) muscles, moderately abundant in SJL/J muscles, and rare in C57BL/6J muscles. Thus, MHC class I was markedly up-regulated in SJL/J muscles, but this high level of MHC class I was not necessary for the appearance of myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: The authors recently described a new autosomal dominant myopathy (OMIM 605637 inclusion body myopathy 3) associated with a missense mutation in the myosin heavy chain (MyHC) IIa gene (MyHC IIa, Human Gene Map [HGM] locus MYH2). Young patients showed minor changes in their muscle biopsies, although dystrophic alterations and rimmed vacuoles with 15-to 20-nm tubulofilaments identical to those in sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM) were observed in some of the adult (especially older) patients. The current study was undertaken to investigate the relation between expression of the mutant MyHC IIa and pathologic changes in muscle. METHODS: The expression of MyHC IIa in nine muscle specimens from six individuals carrying the mutation was analyzed by immunohistochemistry, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and a new reverse transcriptase--PCR method to measure the relative abundance of the various MyHC transcripts. RESULTS: Young patients with muscle weakness and minor pathologic changes in muscle expressed MyHC IIa at undetectable levels. MyHC IIa was expressed at high levels in adults with a progressive clinical course and dystrophic muscle changes. In these cases, a large number of muscle fibers were hybrids with expression of more than one MyHC isoform. Both MyHC IIa alleles were equally expressed. The relative level of MyHC IIa transcripts exceeded that of the corresponding protein, indicating an increased turnover of mutated protein. MyHC IIa expression was a consistent finding in muscle fibers with rimmed vacuoles. CONCLUSIONS: The clear correlation between pathologic changes and expression of MyHC IIa indicates that defects in MyHC may lead not only to muscle weakness but also to muscle degeneration. The consistent expression of MyHC IIa in muscle fibers with rimmed vacuoles indicates that the breakdown of sarcomeric proteins is a key element in the pathogenesis of rimmed vacuoles of s-IBM type.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The autoantigenic polymyositis/scleroderma (PM/Scl) complex was recently shown to be the human homologue of the yeast exosome, which is an RNA-processing complex. Our aim was to assess whether, in addition to targeting the known autoantigens PM/Scl-100 and PM/Scl-75, autoantibodies also target recently identified components of the PM/Scl complex. The prevalence of autoantibodies directed to six novel human exosome components (hRrp4p, hRrp40p, hRrp41p, hRrp42p, hRrp46p, hCsl4p) was determined in sera from patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (n = 48), scleroderma (n = 11), or the PM/Scl overlap syndrome (n = 10). The sera were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and western blotting using the affinity-purified recombinant proteins. Our results show that each human exosome component is recognized by autoantibodies. The hRrp4p and hRrp42p components were most frequently targeted. The presence of autoantibodies directed to the novel components of the human exosome was correlated with the presence of the anti-PM/Scl-100 autoantibody in the sera of patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM), as was previously found for the anti-PM/Scl-75 autoantibody. Other clear associations between autoantibody activities were not found. These results further support the conception that the autoimmune response may initially be directed to PM/Scl-100, whereas intermolecular epitope spreading may have caused the autoantibody response directed to the associated components.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular basis of autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (AD-LGMD) in three large new families. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genome-wide linkage was performed to show that the causative gene in all three families localized to chromosome 21q22.3 (Zmax = 10.3; theta = 0). This region contained the collagen VI alpha1 and alpha2 genes, which have been previously shown to harbor mutations causing a relatively mild congenital myopathy with contractures (Bethlem myopathy). Screening of the collagen VI alpha1 and alpha2 genes revealed novel, causative mutations in each family (COL6A1-K121R, G341D; COL6A2-D620N); two of these mutations were in novel regions of the proteins not previously associated with disease. Collagen VI is a ubiquitously expressed component of connective tissue; however, both limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and Bethlem myopathy patients show symptoms restricted to skeletal muscle. To address the muscle-specific symptoms resulting from collagen VI mutations, the authors studied three patient muscle biopsies at the molecular level (protein expression). A marked reduction of laminin beta1 protein in the myofiber basal lamina in all biopsies was found, although this protein was expressed normally in the neighboring capillary basal laminae. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' studies widen the clinical spectrum of Bethlem myopathy and suggest collagen VI etiology should be investigated in dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The authors hypothesize that collagen VI mutations lead to muscle-specific defects of the basal lamina, and may explain the muscle-specific symptoms of Bethlem and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy patients with collagen VI mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotubularin-related genes define a novel highly conserved family of eukaryotic proteins of at least 11 human members. The hMTM1 gene that codes for myotubularin is mutated in X-linked myotubular myopathy, a severe congenital disease. Recently, we and others have characterized myotubularin as a potent and specific phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 3-phosphatase. In the present study we investigated the lipid phosphatase activity and the subcellular localization of two other members of the family, hMTMR2 protein that is mutated in the demyelinating neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B and the FYVE-finger containing hMTMR3 protein. Our results show that both proteins are potent phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 3-phosphatases either in vitro or in yeast where they interfered with vesicular trafficking. Their localization is mainly cytoplasmic, with however strong labeling of Rac-inducible plasma membrane ruffles. The fact that the ubiquitously expressed hMTM1 and hMTMR2 genes are involved in different pathologies indicates that despite their shared enzymatic activity, they are not functionally redundant, at least in certain cell types. This might be explained by subtle differences in expression and/or in recruitment and regulation at their specific site of action.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Oxidative stress has been suggested as one of the pathogenetic mechanisms of inclusion body myositis (IBM). To study the role of antioxidant enzymes in myopathies with rimmed vacuoles, we examined expressions of copper, zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu, Zn-SOD) and manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), and the relationship between SODs and other proteins localized in rimmed vacuoles in muscle biopsy specimens from three cases of sporadic IBM and two of distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles (DMRV) as well as eight control cases of myopathies without rimmed vacuoles. Immunoblot analysis showed distinct protein bands of both SODs in IBM and DMRV using subtype-specific antibodies. Intensities of immunoreactive bands for Mn-SOD in IBM and DMRV were stronger than those in the control cases. Immunohistochemistry disclosed accumulation of both SODs in vacuolated muscle fibers in all cases of IBM and DMRV. Immunoreactivity for Mn-SOD was often colocalized with that of nitrotyrosine, cytochrome oxidase, tau, and lysosome-associated membrane proteins 2 (LAMP-2) in vacuolated fibers. Some of the Cu, Zn-SOD-positive vacuolated fibers were associated with ubiquitin. The two SODs may have different roles for cell protection, and the expression of Mn-SOD is associated with nitric oxide-induced oxidative damage in myopathies with rimmed vacuoles.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Lack of type XV collagen in mice results in mild skeletal myopathy and increases vulnerability to exercise-induced skeletal muscle and cardiac injury [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98 (2001), 1194]. The expression of type XV collagen was studied during murine fetal development from 10.5 to 18.5 dpc using immunofluorescence. The first sign of type expression was seen in the capillaries of many tissues at 10.5 dpc, some of them showing developmental transitions in the expression. Interestingly, capillaries forming the blood-brain barrier and those of the sinusoidal type were essentially lacking in this collagen. Early expression was also detected in the skeletal muscle and peripheral nerves, while expression in the heart, kidney and lung appeared to be developmentally regulated. In addition, distinct staining was found in the perichondrium of the cartilage. Collectively, the dynamics of its expression during development, its localization in the basement membrane--fibrillar matrix interface and the consequences of its absence in mice suggest a structural role in providing stability at least in skeletal muscle and capillaries. The early prominent expression of type XV collagen in newly forming blood vessels could also indicate a possible role in angiogenic processes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Desmin intermediate filaments are key structures in the cytoskeleton of cardiac muscle. Since they are associated with Z-discs and intercalated discs, they may have a role in sarcomere alignment or force transmission. We have explored the mechanical function of the desmin filaments in the cardiac wall by comparing desmin-deficient (Des-/-) and wild-type (Des+/+) mice. METHODS: The Langendorff technique was used to examine the contractility of the whole heart. Rate of force generation, Ca(2+)-sensitivity and force per cross-sectional area were measured in skinned ventricle muscle preparations. RESULTS: Des-/-mice have a cardiomyopathy with increased heart weight. Diastolic pressure was increased at all filling volumes in the Des-/-group. Since passive wall stress (i.e. force per area) was unchanged, the alteration in diastolic pressure is a consequence of the thicker ventricle wall. Developed pressure, rate of pressure increase and developed wall stress were significantly reduced, suggesting that active force generation of the contractile apparatus is reduced in Des-/-. Concentrations of actin and myosin in the ventricle were unaltered. Measurements in skinned muscle preparations showed a lower active force development with unaltered Ca(2+)-sensitivity and rate of tension development. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that the intermediate filaments have a role in active force generation of cardiac muscle, possibly by supporting sarcomere alignment or force transmission. The desmin filaments do not contribute the passive elasticity of the ventricle wall. Des-/-mice provide a model for genetic cardiomyopathy where the main factor contributing to altered cardiac performance is a decrease in active force generation, possibly in combination with a loss of functional contractile units.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H (LGMD2H) is a mild autosomal recessive myopathy that was first described in the Manitoba Hutterite population. Previous studies in our laboratory mapped the causative gene for this disease to a 6.5-Mb region in chromosomal region 9q31-33, flanked by D9S302 and D9S1850. We have now used additional families and a panel of 26 microsatellite markers to construct haplotypes. Twelve recombination events that reduced the size of the candidate region to 560 kb were identified or inferred. This region is flanked by D9S1126 and D9S737 and contains at least four genes. Exons of these genes were sequenced in one affected individual, and four sequence variations were identified. The families included in our study and 100 control individuals were tested for these variations. On the basis of our results, the mutation in the tripartite-motif-containing gene (TRIM32) that replaces aspartate with asparagine at position 487 appears to be the causative mutation of LGMD2H. All affected individuals were found to be homozygous for D487N, and this mutation was not found in any of the controls. This mutation occurs in an NHL (named after the proteins NCL1, HT2A, and LIN-41) domain at a position that is highly conserved. NHL domains are known to be involved in protein-protein interactions. Although the function of TRIM32 is unknown, current knowledge of the domain structure of this protein suggests that it may be an E3-ubiquitin ligase. If proven, this represents a new pathogenic mechanism leading to muscular dystrophy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The authors describe a patient with sporadic distal myopathy associated with reduced caveolin-3 in muscle fibers in which the muscle atrophy was restricted to the small muscles of the hands and feet. Gene analysis disclosed a heterozygous 80 G-->A substitution in the caveolin-3 gene that was identical to that of reported cases of elevated serum creatine kinase. This patient further demonstrated possible clinical heterogeneity of myopathies with mutations in the caveolin-3 gene.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked myotubular myopathy (MTM1) is a rare developmental disorder of skeletal muscle that is characterized by the presence of abnormal central nuclei in biopsy specimens taken from affected individuals. To date 133 different mutations have been identified in the MTM1 gene worldwide. We report here mutations detected in 50 additional U.S. families with biopsy-proven MTM1. Forty-one of the patients have not been described previously, including 18 with novel mutations. Eighty-eight percent of the mothers of sporadic cases that were studied were identified as carriers, extending the previously reported high-carrier frequency for this disorder. Clinical information collected on the majority of patients helps to further correlate genotype with phenotype, and implications of these data for genetic counseling in families are discussed.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>McLeod syndrome is caused by mutations of XK, an X-chromosomal gene of unknown function. Originally defined as a peculiar Kell blood group variant, the disease affects multiple organs, including the nervous system, but is certainly underdiagnosed. We analyzed the mutations and clinical findings of 22 affected men, aged 27 to 72 years. Fifteen different XK mutations were found, nine of which were novel, including the one of the eponymous case McLeod. Their common result is predicted absence or truncation of the XK protein. All patients showed elevated levels of muscle creatine phosphokinase, but clinical myopathy was less common. A peripheral neuropathy with areflexia was found in all but 2 patients. The central nervous system was affected in 15 patients, as obvious from the occurrence of seizures, cognitive impairment, psychopathology, and choreatic movements. Neuroimaging emphasized the particular involvement of the basal ganglia, which was also detected in 1 asymptomatic young patient. Most features develop with age, mainly after the fourth decade. The resemblance of McLeod syndrome with Huntington's disease and with autosomal recessive chorea-acanthocytosis suggests that the corresponding proteins--XK, huntingtin, and chorein--might belong to a common pathway, the dysfunction of which causes degeneration of the basal ganglia.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To determine the cause of sporadic rippling muscle disease (RMD) in a 24-year-old patient. BACKGROUND: RMD is a rare myopathy characterized by percussion-induced rapid muscle contractions (PIRC), muscle mounding, and rippling waves. We have recently found that autosomal dominant RMD is caused by mutations in the caveolin-3 gene (CAV3) on chromosome 3p25. Possibly, increased activity of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) contributes to the clinical characteristics of increased mechanical muscle hyperexcitability. METHODS: Clinical examination, mutational analysis, and immunohistochemistry of muscle tissue were performed in a patient with sporadic RMD. RESULTS: The authors observed a de novo CAV3 missense mutation Arg26Gln. Immunohistochemistry showed reduced caveolin-3 surface expression in a muscle biopsy. In addition, the authors found normal sarcolemmal nNOS expression and a reduced expression of alpha-dystroglycan in muscle fibers. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that RMD is caused by CAV3 mutations. Moreover, there is evidence that CAV3 mutations may also be found in patients without a positive family history of RMD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Autosomal dominant myopathy, Paget disease of bone, and dementia constitute a unique disorder (MIM 605382). Here we describe the clinical, biochemical, radiological, and pathological characteristics of 49 affected (23 male, 26 female) individuals from four unrelated United States families. Among these affected individuals 90% have myopathy, 43% have Paget disease of bone, and 37% have premature frontotemporal dementia. EMG shows myopathic changes and muscle biopsy reveals nonspecific myopathic changes or blue-rimmed vacuoles. After candidate loci were excluded, a genome-wide screen in the large Illinois family showed linkage to chromosome 9 (maximum LOD score 3.64 with marker D9S301). Linkage analysis with a high density of chromosome 9 markers generated a maximum two-point LOD score of 9.29 for D9S1791, with a maximum multipoint LOD score of 12.24 between D9S304 and D9S1788. Subsequent evaluation of three additional families demonstrating similar clinical characteristics confirmed this locus, refined the critical region, and further delineated clinical features of this unique disorder. Hence, autosomal dominant inclusion body myopathy (HIBM), Paget disease of bone (PDB), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) localizes to a 1.08-6.46 cM critical interval on 9p13.3-12 in the region of autosomal recessive IBM2.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous muscle disorder. In the nebulin gene we have detected a number of autosomal recessive mutations. Both autosomal dominant and recessive mutations have been detected in the genes for alpha-actin and alpha-tropomyosin 3. A recessive mutation causing nemaline myopathy among the Old Order Amish has recently been identified in the gene for slow skeletal muscle troponin T. As linkage studies had shown that at least one further gene exists for nemaline myopathy, we investigated another tropomyosin gene expressed in skeletal muscle, the beta-tropomyosin 2 gene. Screening 66 unrelated patients, using single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and sequencing, we found four polymorphisms and two heterozygous missense mutations. Both mutations affect conserved amino acids, and in both cases, the mutant allele is expressed. We speculate that the observed mutations affect the formation of the tropomyosin dimer and its actin-binding properties.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The autosomal dominant mutation causing myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is a CTG repeat expansion in the 3'-UTR of the DM protein kinase (DMPK) gene. This multisystemic disorder includes myotonia, progressive weakness and wasting of skeletal muscle and extramuscular symptoms such as cataracts, testicular atrophy, endocrine and cognitive dysfunction. The mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis are complex. Recent reports have revealed that DMPK gene haploinsufficiency may account for cardiac conduction defects whereas cataracts may be due to haploinsufficiency of the neighboring gene, the DM-associated homeobox protein (DMAHP or SIX5) gene. Furthermore, mice expressing the CUG expansion in an unrelated mRNA develop myotonia and myopathy, consistent with an RNA gain of function. We demonstrated that transgenic mice carrying the CTG expansion in its human DM1 context (>45 kb) and producing abnormal DMPK mRNA with at least 300 CUG repeats, displayed clinical, histological, molecular and electrophysiological abnormalities in skeletal muscle consistent with those observed in DM1 patients. Like DM1 patients, these transgenic mice show abnormal tau expression in the brain. These results provide further evidence for the RNA trans-dominant effect of the CUG expansion, not only in muscle, but also in brain.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Central core disease (CCD) is an autosomal dominant congenital myopathy. Diagnosis is based on the presence of cores in skeletal muscles. CCD has been linked to the gene encoding the ryanodine receptor (RYR1) and is considered to be an allelic disease of malignant hyperthermia susceptibility. However, the report of a recessive form of transmission together with a variable clinical presentation has raised the question of the genetic heterogeneity of the disease. Analyzing a panel of 34 families exclusively recruited on the basis of both clinically and morphologically expressed CCD, 12 different mutations of the C-terminal domain of RYR1 have been identified in 16 unrelated families. Morphological analysis of the patients' muscles showed different aspects of cores, all of them associated with mutations in the C-terminal region of RYR1. Furthermore, we characterized the presence of neomutations in the RyR1 gene in four families. This indicates that neomutations into the RyR1 gene are not a rare event and must be taken into account for genetic studies of families that present with congenital myopathies type 'central core disease'. Three mutations led to the deletion in frame of amino acids. This is the first report of amino acid deletions in RYR1 associated with CCD. According to a four-transmembrane domain model, the mutations concentrated mostly in the myoplasmic and luminal loops linking, respectively, transmembrane domains T1 and T2 or T3 and T4 of RYR1.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Cypher is a member of a recently emerging family of proteins containing a PDZ domain at their NH(2) terminus and one or three LIM domains at their COOH terminus. Cypher knockout mice display a severe form of congenital myopathy and die postnatally from functional failure in multiple striated muscles. Examination of striated muscle from the mutants revealed that Cypher is not required for sarcomerogenesis or Z-line assembly, but rather is required for maintenance of the Z-line during muscle function. In vitro studies demonstrated that individual domains within Cypher localize independently to the Z-line via interactions with alpha-actinin or other Z-line components. These results suggest that Cypher functions as a linker-strut to maintain cytoskeletal structure during contraction.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The mitochondrial deoxyribonucleotide (dNTP) pool is separated from the cytosolic pool because the mitochondria inner membrane is impermeable to charged molecules. The mitochondrial pool is maintained by either import of cytosolic dNTPs through dedicated transporters or by salvaging deoxynucleosides within the mitochondria; apparently, enzymes of the de novo dNTP synthesis pathway are not present in the mitochondria. In non-replicating cells, where cytosolic dNTP synthesis is down-regulated, mtDNA synthesis depends solely on the mitochondrial salvage pathway enzymes, the deoxyribonucleosides kinases. Two of the four human deoxyribonucleoside kinases, deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) and thymidine kinase-2 (TK2), are expressed in mitochondria. Human dGK efficiently phosphorylates deoxyguanosine and deoxyadenosine, whereas TK2 phosphorylates deoxythymidine, deoxycytidine and deoxyuridine. Here we identify two mutations in TK2, histidine 90 to asparagine and isoleucine 181 to asparagine, in four individuals who developed devastating myopathy and depletion of muscular mitochondrial DNA in infancy. In these individuals, the activity of TK2 in muscle mitochondria is reduced to 14-45% of the mean value in healthy control individuals. Mutations in TK2 represent a new etiology for mitochondrial DNA depletion, underscoring the importance of the mitochondrial dNTP pool in the pathogenesis of mitochondrial depletion.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Inositol lipids play key roles in many fundamental cellular processes that include growth, cell survival, motility, and membrane trafficking. Recent studies on the PTEN and Myotubularin proteins have underscored the importance of inositol lipid 3-phosphatases in cell function. Inactivating mutations in the genes encoding PTEN and Myotubularin are key steps in the progression of some cancers and in the onset of X-linked myotubular myopathy, respectively. Myotubularin-related protein 3 (MTMR3) shows extensive homology to Myotubularin, including the catalytic domain, but additionally possesses a C-terminal extension that includes a FYVE domain. We show that MTMR3 is an inositol lipid 3-phosphatase, with a so-far-unique substrate specificity. It is able to hydrolyze PtdIns3P and PtdIns3,5P2, both in vitro and when heterologously expressed in S. cerevisiae, and to thereby provide the first clearly defined route for the cellular production of PtdIns5P. Overexpression of a catalytically dead MTMR3 (C413S) in mammalian cells induces a striking formation of vacuolar compartments that enclose membranous structures that are highly concentrated in mutant proteins.</rdfs:comment>

Previously, two kinds of deletions and eight missense mutations have been identified in the desmin gene and proven to be responsible for the disorder. The present study was conducted to determine structural and functional defects in a pathogenic desmin variant that caused a disabling disorder in an isolated case presenting with distal and proximal limb muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy. We identified a novel heterozygous Q389P desmin mutation located at the C-terminal part of the rod domain as the causative mutation in this case. Transfection of desmin cDNA containing the patient's mutation into C2.7, MCF7, and SW13 cells demonstrated that the Q389P mutant is incapable of constructing a functional intermediate filament network and has a dominant negative effect on filament formation. We conclude that Q389P mutation is the molecular event leading to the development of desmin-related myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Both enzyme replacement and gene therapy of lysosomal storage disorders rely on the receptor-mediated uptake of lysosomal enzymes secreted by cells, and for each lysosomal disorder it is necessary to select the correct cell type for recombinant enzyme production or for targeting gene therapy. For example, for the therapy of Pompe disease, a severe metabolic myopathy and cardiomyopathy caused by deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), skeletal muscle seems an obvious choice as a depot organ for local therapy and for the delivery of the recombinant enzyme into the systemic circulation. Using knockout mice with this disease and transgenes containing cDNA for the human enzyme under muscle or liver specific promoters controlled by tetracycline, we have demonstrated that the liver provided enzyme far more efficiently. The achievement of therapeutic levels with skeletal muscle transduction required the entire muscle mass to produce high levels of enzyme of which little found its way to the plasma, whereas liver, comprising &lt;5% of body weight, secreted 100-fold more enzyme, all of which was in the active 110 kDa precursor form. Furthermore, using tetracycline regulation, we somatically induced human GAA in the knockout mice, and demonstrated that the skeletal and cardiac muscle pathology was completely reversible if the treatment was begun early.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Type XIII collagen is a type II transmembrane protein found at many sites of cell adhesion in tissues. Homologous recombination was used to generate a transgenic mouse line (Col13a1(N/N)) that expresses N-terminally altered type XIII collagen molecules lacking the short cytosolic and transmembrane domains but retaining the large collagenous ectodomain. The mutant molecules were correctly transported to focal adhesions in cultured fibroblasts derived from the Col13a1(N/N) mice, but the cells showed decreased adhesion when plated on type IV collagen. These mice were viable and fertile, and in immunofluorescence stainings the mutant protein was located in adhesive tissue structures in the same manner as normal alpha1(XIII) chains. In immunoelectron microscopy of wild-type mice type XIII collagen was detected at the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle cells whereas in the mutant mice the protein was located in the adjacent extracellular matrix. Affected skeletal muscles showed abnormal myofibers with a fuzzy plasma membrane-basement membrane interphase along the muscle fiber and at the myotendinous junctions, disorganized myofilaments, and streaming of z-disks. The findings were progressive and the phenotype was aggravated by exercise. Thus type XIII collagen seems to participate in the linkage between muscle fiber and basement membrane, a function impaired by lack of the cytosolic and transmembrane domains.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, catalyzing the transfer of electrons from reduced cytochrome c to molecular oxygen. It is composed of 13 structural subunits, three of which are encoded in mtDNA and form the catalytic core of the enzyme. In addition to these structural subunits, a large number of accessory factors are necessary for the assembly and maintenance of the active holoenzyme complex. Most isolated COX deficiencies are inherited as autosomal recessive disorders; mutations in the mtDNA-encoded COX subunit genes are relatively rare. These mutations are associated with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes ranging from isolated myopathy to multisystem disease, with onset from late childhood to adulthood. Autosomal recessive COX deficiencies generally have a very early age of onset and a fatal outcome. Several clinical presentations have been described including Leigh Syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and myopathy, and fatal infantile lactic acidosis. Surprisingly, mutations in the nuclear-encoded structural COX subunits have not been found in association with any of these phenotypes. Mutations have, however, been identified in several COX assembly factors: SURF1 (Leigh Syndrome), SCO2 (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), SCO1 (hepatic failure, ketoacidotic coma), and COX10 (encephalopathy, tubulopathy). As all of these assembly factors are ubiquitously expressed, the molecular basis for the different clinical presentations remains unexplained. Although the genetic defects in the majority of patients with COX deficiency are unknown, it is likely that most will be solved in the near future using functional complementation techniques.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: The LMNA gene, one of 6 autosomal disease genes implicated in familial dilated cardiomyopathy, encodes lamins A and C, alternatively spliced nuclear envelope proteins. Mutations in lamin A/C cause 4 diseases: Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 1B, Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy, and dilated cardiomyopathy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two 4-generation white families with autosomal dominant familial dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction system disease were found to have novel mutations in the rod segment of lamin A/C. In family A a missense mutation (nucleotide G607A, amino acid E203K) was identified in 14 adult subjects; disease was manifest as progressive conduction disease in the fourth and fifth decades. Death was caused by heart failure. In family B a nonsense mutation (nucleotide C673T, amino acid R225X) was identified in 10 adult subjects; disease was also manifest as progressive conduction disease but with earlier onset (third and fourth decades), ventricular dysrhythmias, left ventricular enlargement, and systolic dysfunction. Death was caused by heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Skeletal muscle disease was not observed in either family. CONCLUSIONS: Novel rod segment mutations in lamin A/C cause variable conduction system disease and dilated cardiomyopathy without skeletal myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Although X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a recessive disorder, heterozygous female carriers of MTM1 mutations may present with limb girdle and facial weakness. It is proposed that manifesting heterozygote females with XLMTM have a skewed pattern of X-chromosome inactivation. However, skewed X-chromosome inactivation was not detected in either the lymphocyte or muscle DNA of a woman who presented with limb girdle/facial weakness and was found to be heterozygous for the R224X mutation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlin is a surface membrane protein in skeletal muscle whose deficiency causes distal and proximal, recessively inherited, forms of muscular dystrophy designated Miyoshi myopathy (MM) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B), respectively. The function of dysferlin is not defined. Caveolin-3 is another skeletal muscle membrane protein which is important in the formation of caveolae and whose mutations cause dominantly inherited limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 1C (LGMD1C). We report that dysferlin co-immunoprecipitates with caveolin-3 from biopsied normal human skeletal muscles. We also describe abnormal localization of dysferlin in muscles from patients with LGMD1C including novel missense mutation (T64P) in the human caveolin-3 gene (CAV3). The immunoprecipitation data are consistent with the parallel observation that dysferlin immunostaining is not normal in LGMD1C muscles. Amino acid sequence analysis of the dysferlin protein reveals seven sites that correspond to caveolin-3 scaffold-binding motifs, and one site that is a potential target to bind the WW domain of the caveolin-3 protein. This is the first description of a possible dysferlin interacting protein; it suggests the hypothesis that one function of dysferlin may be to interact with caveolin-3 to subserve signaling functions of caveolae.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hereditary inclusion body myopathy (HIBM; OMIM 600737) is a unique group of neuromuscular disorders characterized by adult onset, slowly progressive distal and proximal weakness and a typical muscle pathology including rimmed vacuoles and filamentous inclusions. The autosomal recessive form described in Jews of Persian descent is the HIBM prototype. This myopathy affects mainly leg muscles, but with an unusual distribution that spares the quadriceps. This particular pattern of weakness distribution, termed quadriceps-sparing myopathy (QSM), was later found in Jews originating from other Middle Eastern countries as well as in non-Jews. We previously localized the gene causing HIBM in Middle Eastern Jews on chromosome 9p12-13 (ref. 5) within a genomic interval of about 700 kb (ref. 6). Haplotype analysis around the HIBM gene region of 104 affected people from 47 Middle Eastern families indicates one unique ancestral founder chromosome in this community. By contrast, single non-Jewish families from India, Georgia (USA) and the Bahamas, with QSM and linkage to the same 9p12-13 region, show three distinct haplotypes. After excluding other potential candidate genes, we eventually identified mutations in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase (GNE) gene in the HIBM families: all patients from Middle Eastern descent shared a single homozygous missense mutation, whereas distinct compound heterozygotes were identified in affected individuals of families of other ethnic origins. Our findings indicate that GNE is the gene responsible for recessive HIBM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A severe muscle enolase deficiency, with 5% of residual activity, was detected in a 47-year-old man affected with exercise intolerance and myalgias. No rise of serum lactate was observed with the ischemic forearm exercise. Ultrastructural analysis showed focal sarcoplasmic accumulation of glycogen beta particles. The enzyme enolase catalyzes the interconversion of 2-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate. In adult human muscle, over 90% of enolase activity is accounted for by the beta-enolase subunit, the protein product of the ENO3 gene. The beta-enolase protein was dramatically reduced in the muscle of our patient, by both immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting, while alpha-enolase was normally represented. The ENO3 gene of our patient carries two heterozygous missense mutations affecting highly conserved amino acid residues; a G467A transition changing a glycine residue at position 156 to aspartate, in close proximity to the catalytic site, and a G1121A transition changing a glycine to glutamate at position 374. These mutations were probably inherited as autosomal recessive traits since the mother was heterozygous for the G467A and a sister was heterozygous for the G1121A transition. Our data suggest that ENO3 mutations result in decreased stability of mutant beta-enolase. Muscle beta-enolase deficiency should be considered in the differential diagnosis of metabolic myopathies due to inherited defects of distal glycolysis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotubularin and myotubularin-related proteins are dual-specificity phosphatases. Several myotubularin-related proteins have been identified in humans and mice. The members of the myotubularin protein family are highly conserved, from humans to yeast. Mutations in the human myotubularin gene (MTM1) lead to X-linked myotubular myopathy. Here we isolate and localize a novel putative myotubularin-related protein gene (MTMR8) on chromosome 8p22--p23,between the markers D8S550 and D8S265, by exon-trapping experiments and RT-PCR. Genomic sequencing revealed that the gene consists of 10 exons and spans approximately 43 kb. The corresponding cDNA is 7081 bp. The open reading frame predicts a protein of 549 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 63 kDa. Like myotubularin-related protein-5, MTMR8 has no dual-specificity phosphatase domain. It contains a double-helical motif similar to the SET interaction domain, which is thought to have a role in the control of cell proliferation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the skeletal muscle gene dysferlin cause two autosomal recessive forms of muscular dystrophy: Miyoshi myopathy (MM) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B). The purpose of this study was to define the genomic organization of the dysferlin gene and conduct mutational screening and a survey of clinical features in 21 patients with defined molecular defects in the dysferlin gene. METHODS: Genomic organization of the gene was determined by comparing the dysferlin cDNA and genomic sequence in P1-derived artificial chromosomes (PACs) containing the gene. Mutational screening entailed conformational analysis and sequencing of genomic DNA and cDNA. Clinical records of patients with defined dysferlin gene defects were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: The dysferlin gene encompasses 55 exons spanning over 150 kb of genomic DNA. Mutational screening revealed nine novel mutations associated with MM. The range of onset in this patient group was narrow with a mean of 19.0 +/-3.9 years. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that the dysferlin gene is mutated in MM and LGMD2B and extends understanding of the timing of onset of the disease. Knowledge of the genomic organization of the gene will facilitate mutation detection and investigations of the molecular biologic properties of the dysferlin gene.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the MTM1 gene cause X-linked recessive myotubular myopathy (XLMTM; MIM310400). Myotubularin, the implicated protein, is a phosphoinositide phosphatase that belongs to a large protein family conserved through evolution that also includes the antiphosphatase Sbfl and the protein hMTMR2 mutated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B. Myotubularin is detectable in a variety of cell lines by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. We screened 29 independant patients with XLMTM phenotype and four with centronuclear myopathy. 87% (21/24) of patients with known MTM1 mutations showed abnormal myotubularin levels, including some with missense mutations. Moreover, myotubularin was also undetectable in a patient for whom no mutation could be identified by SSCP screening. The centronuclear cases investigated have a normal level of protein, suggesting that the centronuclear form is not the result of a decrease in myotubularin level. Thus, immunoprecipitation of myotubularin from cultured cells represents a rapid and helpful method for classifying those cases where no mutation was found. On the other hand, the amount of expression may be of diagnostic value for disease course in patients with a mutation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Desmuslin is an alpha-dystrobrevin-interacting protein expressed primarily in heart and skeletal muscle. The desmuslin protein interacts with and is closely related to desmin, a protein encoded by a locus mutated in some forms of hereditary distal myopathy. As a muscle-specific intermediate filament protein, desmuslin is also a candidate for myopathies of unknown etiology. RESULTS: The desmuslin gene was localized to chromosome 15q26.3 by electronic screening of the human DNA sequence database. Primer pairs were designed to amplify the 5 exons of the desmuslin gene in 11 overlapping DNA segments. The desmuslin gene was screened for mutations in 71 patients with various forms of myopathy for which there was no known cause. In this analysis, 10 common and 2 rare amino acid altering single-nucleotide polymorphisms were identified, all of which were seen in a control population of individuals thus making these unlikely causes of the phenotype. Interestingly, one of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms found in a patient resulted in a premature stop codon in the first exon. The nonsense mutation was also detected in the patient's unaffected father and one unaffected control; it was detected in 0.44% (2/454) of unrelated chromosomes and is therefore predicted to have a homozygous frequency of 0.002%. CONCLUSION: No causative mutations were found in the desmuslin gene. However, the single-nucleotide polymorphisms mapped in this study represent a well-mapped group that can be used for disequilibrium studies of this region of chromosome 15q26.3.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Cofilins are actin binding proteins and regulate actin assembly in vivo. Numerous cofilin homologues have been characterized in various organisms including mammals. In mice, a ubiquitously expressed cofilin (CFL1) and a skeletal muscle specific cofilin (CFL2) have been described. In the present study, we identified and characterized a human CFL2 gene localized on chromosome 14, with high homology to murine CFL2. Furthermore, we provide evidence for differentially spliced CFL2 transcripts (CFL2a and CFL2b). CFL2b is expressed predominantly in human skeletal muscle and heart, while CFL2a is expressed in various tissues. Genetic defects of CFL2 were excluded for one human muscle disorder, the chromosome 14 linked distal myopathy MPD1, and shown to be only possible to be a rare cause of another, nemaline myopathy. In a mouse model of mechanically induced muscle damage the changes of cofilin expression were monitored during the first 10 days of regeneration, with dephosphorylated CFL2 being the major isoform at later stages of muscle regeneration. A similar predominance of dephosphorylated CFL2 was observed in chronically regenerating dystrophin-deficient muscles of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. Therefore, the CFL2 isoform may play an important role in normal muscle function and muscle regeneration.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Spontaneous and engineered mouse mutants have facilitated our understanding of the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy and they provide models for the development of therapeutic approaches. The mouse myodystrophy (myd) mutation produces an autosomal recessive, neuromuscular phenotype. Homozygotes have an abnormal gait, show abnormal posturing when suspended by the tail and are smaller than littermate controls. Serum creatine kinase is elevated and muscle histology is typical of a progressive myopathy with focal areas of acute necrosis and clusters of regenerating fibers. Additional aspects of the phenotype include sensorineural deafness, reduced lifespan and decreased reproductive fitness. The myd mutation maps to mouse chromosome 8 at approximately 33 centimorgans (cM) (refs. 2, 4-7). Here we show that the gene mutated in myd encodes a glycosyltransferase, Large. The human homolog of this gene (LARGE) maps to chromosome 22q. In myd, an intragenic deletion of exons 4-7 causes a frameshift in the resultant mRNA and a premature termination codon before the first of the two catalytic domains. On immunoblots, a monoclonal antibody to alpha-dystroglycan (a component of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex) shows reduced binding in myd, which we attribute to altered glycosylation of this protein. We speculate that abnormal post-translational modification of alpha-dystroglycan may contribute to the myd phenotype.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A suppressor mutation, D53, of the held-up(2) allele of the Drosophila melanogaster Troponin I (wupA) gene is described. D53, a missense mutation, S185F, of the tropomyosin-2, Tm2, gene fully suppresses all the phenotypic effects of held-up(2), including the destructive hypercontraction of the indirect flight muscles (IFMs), a lack of jumping, the progressive myopathy of the walking muscles, and reductions in larval crawling and feeding behavior. The suppressor restores normal function of the IFMs, but flight ability decreases with age and correlates with an unusual, progressive structural collapse of the myofibrillar lattice starting at the center. The S185F substitution in Tm2 is close to a troponin T binding site on tropomyosin. Models to explain suppression by D53, derived from current knowledge of the vertebrate troponin-tropomyosin complex structure and functions, are discussed. The effects of S185F are compared with those of two mutations in residues 175 and 180 of human alpha-tropomyosin 1 which cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder characterized by muscle weakness and the presence of nemaline bodies (rods) in skeletal muscle. Disease-causing mutations have been reported in five genes, each encoding a protein component of the sarcomeric thin filament. Recently, we identified mutations in the muscle alpha-skeletal-actin gene (ACTA1) in a subset of patients with NM. In the present study, we evaluated a new series of 35 patients with NM. We identified five novel missense mutations in ACTA1, which suggested that mutations in muscle alpha-skeletal actin account for the disease in approximately 15% of patients with NM. The mutations appeared de novo and represent new dominant mutations. One proband subsequently had two affected children, a result consistent with autosomal dominant transmission. The seven patients exhibited marked clinical variability, ranging from severe congenital-onset weakness, with death from respiratory failure during the 1st year of life, to a mild childhood-onset myopathy, with survival into adulthood. There was marked variation in both age at onset and clinical severity in the three affected members of one family. Common pathological features included abnormal fiber type differentiation, glycogen accumulation, myofibrillar disruption, and "whorling" of actin thin filaments. The percentage of fibers with rods did not correlate with clinical severity; however, the severe, lethal phenotype was associated with both severe, generalized disorganization of sarcomeric structure and abnormal localization of sarcomeric actin. The marked variability, in clinical phenotype, among patients with different mutations in ACTA1 suggests that both the site of the mutation and the nature of the amino acid change have differential effects on thin-filament formation and protein-protein interactions. The intrafamilial variability suggests that alpha-actin genotype is not the sole determinant of phenotype.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A nine-octapeptide insertional mutation in the prion protein (PrP) gene is associated with an inherited variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. Transgenic mice that express the mouse PrP homologue of this mutation (designated PG14) under control of a PrP promoter display a progressive neurological disorder characterized by ataxia, apoptosis of cerebellar granule cells, and accumulation in the brain of mutant PrP molecules that display the biochemical hallmarks of PrP(Sc), the pathogenic isoform of PrP. In this report, we have investigated the expression of PG14 PrP in the peripheral tissues of these mice. We found highest levels of mutant PrP in the brain and spinal cord, intermediate levels in skeletal muscle, heart, and testis and low levels in kidney, lung, spleen, intestine, and stomach. Up to 70% of the PG14 PrP expressed in peripheral tissues was detergent-insoluble, and digestion with low concentrations of proteinase K yielded a PrP 27-30 fragment. These results suggest that the mutant protein was converted to a physical state reminiscent of PrP(Sc), although its infectivity remains to be determined. Histological analysis of skeletal muscle, one of the peripheral tissues with the highest level of PG14 PrP, revealed features indicative of a progressive, primary myopathy, including central nuclei, necrotic and regenerating fibers, and variable fiber size. These results indicate that the PG14 mutation structurally alters the protein in a way that promotes conversion to a PrP(Sc)-like state, regardless of the tissue context, and suggest that accumulation of PrP(Sc) can have deleterious effects on skeletal muscle cells as well as on neurons.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy (RC) have impaired diastolic function, but intact systolic function until later stages of the disease, ultimately leading to heart failure. Primary RC is often sporadic, but also may be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, particularly the idiopathic forms. Recently there has been great interest in inherited cardiomyopathy associated with myocyte desmin deposition ('desminopathies'). In some such families, desmin or alpha-B crystallin gene mutation is the underlying cause, and the desmin accumulation affects skeletal muscle as well, usually causing skeletal myopathy. We describe a large family with apparent autosomal dominant inheritance of desmin-associated RC spanning four generations, with the age of onset and severity/rate of progression being highly variable. This family is relatively unique in that there is no symptom-based evidence of skeletal muscle involvement, and the known desminopathy and cardiomyopathy genes/loci have been ruled out. These data support literature suggesting that desmin deposition may be associated with different underlying gene defects, and that a novel desminopathy gene is responsible for the condition in this family.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dystrobrevins are protein components of the dystrophin complex, whose disruption leads to Duchenne muscular dystrophy and related diseases. The Caenorhabditis elegans dystrobrevin gene (dyb-1) encodes a protein 38 % identical with its mammalian counterparts. The C. elegans dystrobrevin is expressed in muscles and neurons. We characterised C. elegans dyb-1 mutants and showed that: (1) their behavioural phenotype resembles that of dystrophin (dys-1) mutants; (2) the phenotype of dyb-1 dys-1 double mutants is not different from the single ones; (3) dyb-1 mutants are more sensitive than wild-type animals to reductions of acetylcholinesterase levels and have an increased response to acetylcholine; (4) dyb-1 mutations alone do not lead to muscle degeneration, but synergistically produce a progressive myopathy when combined with a mild MyoD/hlh-1 mutation. All together, these findings further substantiate the role of dystrobrevins in cholinergic transmission and as functional partners of dystrophin.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The SJL mouse strain has been widely used as an animal model for experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), inflammatory muscle disease and lymphomas and has also been used as a background strain for the generation of animal models for a variety of diseases including motor neurone disease, multiple sclerosis and atherosclerosis. Recently the SJL mouse was shown to have myopathy due to dysferlin deficiency, so that it can now be considered a natural animal model for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy (MM). We have cloned the mouse dysferlin cDNA and analysis of the sequence shows that the mouse dysferlin gene is characterized by six C2 domain sequences and a C-terminal anchoring domain, with the human and the mouse dysferlin genes sharing > 90% sequence homology overall. Genomic analysis of the SJL mutation confirms that the 171 bp RNA deletion has arisen by exon skipping resulting from a splice site mutation. The identification of this mutation has implications for the various groups using this widely available mouse stock.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report a family with a new phenotype of autosomal recessive muscle dystrophy caused by a dysferlin mutation. The onset of the illness is distal, in the muscles of the anterior compartment group. The disease is rapidly progressive, leading to severe proximal weakness. Muscle biopsy showed moderate dystrophic changes with no vacuoles. Dysferlin immunostaining was negative. Gene analysis revealed a frameshift mutation in the exon 50 (delG5966) of the DYSF gene. This phenotype further demonstrates the clinical heterogeneity of the dysferlinopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition. The clinical spectrum ranges from severe cases with antenatal or neonatal onset and early death to late onset cases with only slow progression. Three genes are known to cause nemaline myopathy: the genes for nebulin (NEB) on chromosome 2q22, slow alpha-tropomyosin (TPM3) on chromosome 1q21 and skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) on chromosome 1q42. We present a 39-year-old lady with a mild form of nemaline myopathy, whom we have followed over a period of 25 years. She presented at the age of 7 years with symptoms of mild axial and proximal muscle weakness. The overall course was essentially static, but at 36 years, she went into life-threatening respiratory failure, for which she is currently treated with night-time ventilation. Muscle biopsies at 12, 17 and 39 years of age showed typical nemaline rods, particularly in type 1 fibres. Areas with unevenness of oxidative stain were present in the second and third biopsies. The presence of rods and core-like areas was confirmed on electron microscopy. There was no detectable alteration in actin expression immunocytochemically. A dominant missense mutation in the skeletal muscle alpha-actin gene (ACTA1) was found. This case illustrates the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of nemaline myopathy, and one phenotype of the wide spectrum of severity caused by mutations in the skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) gene. In addition, it shows the diversity of pathological features that can occur in congenital myopathies due to mutations in the same gene.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Caveolin-3 is the muscle-specific isoform of the caveolin protein family, which is a major component of caveolae, small membrane invaginations found in most cell types. Caveolins play important roles in the formation of caveola membranes, acting as scaffolding proteins to organize and concentrate lipid-modified signaling molecules, and modulate a signaling pathway. For instance, caveolin-3 interacts with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and inhibits its catalytic activity. Recently, specific mutations in the caveolin-3 gene, including the Pro104Leu missense mutation, have been shown to cause an autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD1C), which is characterized by the deficiency of caveolin-3 in the sarcolemma. However, the molecular mechanism by which these mutations cause the deficiency of caveolin-3 and muscle cell degeneration remains elusive. Here we generated transgenic mice expressing the Pro104Leu mutant caveolin-3. They showed severe myopathy accompanied by the deficiency of caveolin-3 in the sarcolemma, indicating a dominant negative effect of mutant caveolin-3. Interestingly, we also found a great increase of nNOS activity in their skeletal muscle, which, we propose, may play a role in muscle fiber degeneration in caveolin-3 deficiency.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Type XV collagen occurs widely in the basement membrane zones of tissues, but its function is unknown. To understand the biological role of this protein, a null mutation in the Col15a1 gene was introduced into the germ line of mice. Despite the complete lack of type XV collagen, the mutant mice developed and reproduced normally, and they were indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates. However, Col15a1-deficient mice showed progressive histological changes characteristic for muscular diseases after 3 months of age, and they were more vulnerable than controls to exercise-induced muscle injury. Despite the antiangiogenic role of type XV collagen-derived endostatin, the development of the vasculature appeared normal in the null mice. Nevertheless, ultrastructural analyses revealed collapsed capillaries and endothelial cell degeneration in the heart and skeletal muscle. Furthermore, perfused hearts showed a diminished inotropic response, and exercise resulted in cardiac injury, changes that mimic early or mild heart disease. Thus, type XV collagen appears to function as a structural component needed to stabilize skeletal muscle cells and microvessels.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathy is a hereditary disease of skeletal muscle defined by a distinct pathology of electron-dense accumulations within the sarcomeric units called rods, muscle weakness and, in most cases, a slow oxidative (type 1) fiber predominance. We generated a transgenic mouse model to study this disorder by expressing an autosomal dominant mutant of alpha-tropomyosin(slow) previously identified in a human cohort. Rods were found in all muscles, but to varying extents which did not correlate with the amount of mutant protein present. In addition, a pathological feature not commonly associated with this disorder, cytoplasmic bodies, was found in the mouse and subsequently identified in human samples. Muscle weakness is a major feature of this disease and was examined with respect to fiber composition, degree of rod-containing fibers, fiber mechanics and fiber diameter. Hypertrophy of fast, glycolytic (type 2B) fibers was apparent at 2 months of age. Muscle weakness was apparent in mice at 5-6 months of age, mimicking the late onset observed in humans with this mutation. The late onset did not correlate with observed changes in fiber type and rod pathology. Rather, the onset of muscle weakness correlates with an age-related decrease in fiber diameter and suggests that early onset is prevented by hypertrophy of fast, glycolytic fibers. We suggest that the clinical phenotype is precipitated by a failure of the hypertrophy to persist and therefore compensate for muscle weakness.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The ky mouse mutant exhibits a primary degenerative myopathy preceding chronic thoraco-lumbar kyphoscoliosis. The histopathology of the ky mutant suggests that Ky protein activity is crucial for normal muscle growth and function as well as the maturation and stabilization of the neuromuscular junction. Muscle hypertrophy in response to increasing demand is deficient in the ky mutant, whereas adaptive fibre type shifts take place. The ky locus has previously been localized to a small region of mouse chromosome 9 and we have now identified the gene and the mutation underlying the kyphoscoliotic mouse. The ky transcript encodes a novel protein that is detected only in skeletal muscle and heart. The identification of the ky gene will allow detailed analysis of the impact of primary myopathy on idiopathic scoliosis in mice and man.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy (MM) are autosomal recessive disorders caused by mutations in the dysferlin gene on chromosome 2p13. The authors studied a large Russian family with both LGMD2B and MM. All affected individuals, as well as one preclinical boy with dystrophic changes on muscle biopsy, were found to be homozygous for a novel dysferlin mutation, TG573/574AT (Val67Asp). This finding supports the view that additional factors (e.g., modifier genes) contribute to the phenotypic expression of causative mutations in dysferlinopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We here report on a human myopathy associated with a mutation in a fast myosin heavy chain (MyHC) gene, and also the genetic defect in a hereditary inclusion body myopathy. The disorder has previously been described in a family with an "autosomal dominant myopathy, with joint contractures, ophthalmoplegia, and rimmed vacuoles." Linkage analysis and radiation hybrid mapping showed that the gene locus (Human Genome Map locus name: IBM3) is situated in a 2-Mb region of chromosome 17p13, where also a cluster of MyHC genes is located. These include the genes encoding embryonic, IIa, IIx/d, IIb, perinatal, and extraocular MyHCs. Morphological analysis of muscle biopsies from patients from the family indicated to us that the type 2A fibers frequently were abnormal, whereas other fiber types appeared normal. This observation prompted us to investigate the MyHC-IIa gene, since MyHC-IIa is the major isoform in type 2A fibers. The complete genomic sequence for this gene was deduced by using an "in silico" strategy. The gene, found to consist of 38 exons, was subjected to a complete mutation scan in patients and controls. We identified a missense mutation, Glu-706 --> Lys, which is located in a highly conserved region of the motor domain, the so-called SH1 helix region. By conformational changes this region communicates activity at the nucleotide-binding site to the neck region, resulting in the lever arm swing. The mutation in this region is likely to result in a dysfunctional myosin, compatible with the disorder in the family.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Central core disease (CCD) and nemaline rod myopathy are generally considered two genetically and histologically distinct disorders. CCD is defined by the presence of well-demarcated round cores within most myofibers. Nemaline rod myopathy is distinguished by the presence of characteristic nemaline bodies within myofibers. The simultaneous occurrence of both cores and rods in the same muscle biopsy has been described, but no gene mutations have been reported yet for this condition. OBJECTIVE: To describe a family containing 16 affected individuals in six generations with an autosomal dominant congenital myopathy that shows clinical and histologic features of both CCD and nemaline myopathy, and to determine the genetic etiology and protein composition of the cores/rods in this family. METHODS AND RESULTS: The results of linkage analyses excluded involvement of the two autosomal dominant nemaline myopathy loci on chromosome 1, but were consistent with a localization of the disease gene at the CCD locus on chromosome 19q13.1 (ryanodine receptor). SSCP analysis and DNA sequencing identified a novel Thr4637Ala mutation in the transmembrane region of the ryanodine receptor protein. Immunofluorescence studies of patient muscle biopsies showed the central cores to stain for ryanodine receptor. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the occurrence of nemaline bodies can be a secondary feature of CCD, and that genetic studies on previously reported core/rod families should be targeted to the ryanodine receptor locus. The results of the immunofluorescence studies suggest that the cores contain excess abnormal ryanodine receptor protein.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Skeletal muscle AMP deaminase (AMPD: E.C. 3.5.4.6) deficiency is one of the most common inherited defects in the Caucasians, but not in Asians. Although a diagnosis of AMPD1 deficiency is indeed based on the reduced enzymatic activity, its clinical significance is still rather controversial since most subjects are asymptomatic. Alternative splicing of exon 2 in individuals who have inherited this defect is thought to provide a mechanism for phenotypic rescue that may explain the variability of clinical symptoms as we reported earlier. In this report we present the first case with a detectable defect of the AMPD1 gene in a Japanese patient with myopathy. Two missense mutations (R388W and R425H) in exon 9 and exon 10 of the AMPD1 gene were found. Prokaryotic expression showed a comparable amount of the AMPD1 peptides and undetectable AMPD activity in the constructs with these mutations. From this study, we have concluded that this patient is a compound heterozygote for AMPD1 mutant allele. This study also demonstrates the first reported instance of detectable dysfunction of the AMPD1 gene product, suggesting that AMPD1 indeed has a key role in muscle metabolism and function.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Central core disease (CCD) and nemaline myopathy (NM) are congenital myopathies for which differential diagnosis is often based on the presence either of cores or rods. Missense mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) have been identified in some families with CCD. Mutations in the alpha-tropomyosin and alpha-actin genes have been associated with most dominant forms of NM. Analysis of the RYR1 cDNA in a French family identified a novel Y4796C mutation that lies in the C-terminal channel-forming domain of the RyR1 protein. This mutation was linked not only to a severe and penetrant form of CCD, but also to the presence of rods in the muscle fibres and to the malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) phenotype. The Y4796C mutation was introduced into a rabbit RYR1 cDNA and expressed in HEK-293 cells. Expression of the mutant RYR1 cDNA produced channels with increased caffeine sensitivity and a significantly reduced maximal level of Ca(2+) release. Single-cell Ca(2+) analysis showed that the resting cytoplasmic level was increased by 60% in cells expressing the mutant channel. These data support the view that the rate of Ca(2+) leakage is increased in the mutant channel. The resulting chronic elevation in myoplasmic concentration is likely to be responsible for the severe expression of the disease. Haplotyping analysis indicated that the mutation arose as a neomutation in the proband. This first report of a neomutation in the RYR1 gene has strong implications for genetic linkage studies of MHS or CCD, two diseases characterized by a genetic heterogeneity.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To determine the cause and pathogenic mechanisms of a 21-year-old patient's cardioskeletal myopathy. The patient's muscle atrophy and weakness began in distal parts of limbs; cardiac and facial muscles were later involved. BACKGROUND: Desmin myopathy is a skeletal myopathy often associated with cardiomyopathy, caused by mutations in the desmin gene and characterized by desmin accumulation in affected muscle fibers, a leading marker of myofibrillar myopathies. Two kinds of deletions and seven missense mutations in the desmin gene have been identified. METHODS: Clinical examination, electron microscopy of muscle tissue, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, DNA sequencing, restriction enzyme analysis, and gene transfection were performed. RESULTS: Electron microscopy showed disruption of sarcomeres at Z discs and electron-dense aggregates in biopsied skeletal and heart muscle. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the patient's skeletal muscle proteins showed massive accumulation of desmin. The authors identified a novel desmin mutation, L385P in one allele in the carboxyl end of the rod domain 2B in the patient's leukocytes and skeletal muscle; neither parent had the mutation. Serologic study and DNA markers confirmed the de novo mutation. A peptide harboring desmin rod domains 2A and 2B with L385P tagged with green fluorescent protein induced cytoplasmic aggregates, nuclear DNA condensation, and cell death. CONCLUSIONS: A novel de novo mutation, L385P, causes desmin myopathy. An expression study indicated the toxic effect of the L385P mutation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Primary carnitine deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of fatty acid oxidation caused by defective carnitine transport. This disease is caused by mutations in the novel organic cation transporter OCTN2 (SLC22A5 gene). The disease can present early in life with hypoketotic hypoglycemia or later in life with skeletal myopathy or cardiomyopathy. To determine whether the variation in phenotypic severity is due to mutations retaining residual function, we extended mutational analysis of OCTN2 to four additional European families with primary carnitine deficiency. Three patients were homozygous for novel missense mutations (R169W, G242V, A301D). The fourth patient was compound heterozygous for R169W and W351R substitutions. Stable expression of all the mutations in CHO cells confirmed that all mutations abolished carnitine transport, with the exception of the A301D mutation in which residual carnitine transport was 2-3% of the value measured in cells expressing the normal OCTN2 cDNA. Analysis of the patients characterized in molecular detail by our laboratory failed to indicate a correlation between residual carnitine transport and severity of the phenotype or age at presentation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myogenic factors (MYF) belong to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family and regulate myogenesis and muscle regeneration. The physiological importance of both functions was demonstrated in homozygous Myf knockout mice and mdx mice. Myf5 and Myod are predominantly expressed in proliferating myoblasts while Myf4 and Myf6 are involved in differentiation of myotubes. In a boy with myopathy and an increase of muscle fibres with central nuclei we detected a heterozygous 387G-->T nucleotide transversion in the MYF6 gene (MIM*159991). Protein-protein interaction of mutant MYF6 was reduced, and DNA-binding potential and transactivation capacity were abolished, thus demonstrating MYF6 haploinsufficiency. The boy's father carried the identical mutation and, in addition, an in-frame deletion of exons 45-47 in his dystrophin gene. This mutation is normally associated with a mild to moderate course of Becker muscular dystrophy but the father suffered from a severe course of Becker muscular dystrophy suggesting MYF6 as a modifier.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotubular myopathy (MTM1) is an X-linked disease, characterized by severe neonatal hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness, with pathological features suggesting an impairment in maturation of muscle fibres. The MTM1 gene encodes a protein (myotubularin) with a phosphotyrosine phosphatase consensus. It defines a family of at least nine genes in man, including the antiphosphatase hMTMR5/Sbf1 and hMTMR2, recently found mutated in a recessive form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Myotubularin shows a dual specificity protein phosphatase activity in vitro. We have performed an in vivo test of tyrosine phosphatase activity in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, indicating that myotubularin does not have a broad specificity tyrosine phosphatase activity. Expression of active human myotubularin inhibited growth of S.pombe and induced a vacuolar phenotype similar to that of mutants of the vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) pathway and notably of mutants of VPS34, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). In S.pombe cells deleted for the endogenous MTM homologous gene, expression of human myotubularin decreased the level of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P). We have created a substrate trap mutant which shows relocalization to plasma membrane projections (spikes) in HeLa cells and was inactive in the S.pombe assay. This mutant, but not the wild-type or a phosphatase site mutant, was able to immunoprecipitate a VPS34 kinase activity. Wild-type myotubularin was also able to directly dephosphorylate PI3P and PI4P in vitro. Myotubularin may thus decrease PI3P levels by down-regulating PI3K activity and by directly degrading PI3P.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Dystrophin is the product of the gene that is mutated in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a progressive neuromuscular disease for which no treatment is available. Mice carrying a mutation in the gene for dystrophin (mdx mice) display only a mild phenotype, but it is aggravated when combined with a mutation in the MyoD gene. The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has a dystrophin homologue (dys-1), but null mutations in dys-1 do not result in muscle degeneration. RESULTS: We generated worms carrying both the dys-1 null mutation cx18, and a weak mutation, cc561ts, of the C. elegans MyoD homologue hlh-1. The double mutants displayed a time-dependent impairment of locomotion and egg laying, a phenotype not seen in the single mutants, and extensive muscle degeneration. This result allowed us to look for genes that, when misexpressed, could suppress the dys-1; hlh-1 phenotype. When overexpressed, the dyc-1 gene - whose loss-of-function phenotype resembles that of dys-1 - partially suppressed the dys-1; hlh-1 phenotype. The dyc-1 gene encodes a novel protein sharing similarities with the mammalian neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-binding protein CAPON, and is expressed in the muscles of the worm. CONCLUSIONS: As a C. elegans model for dystrophin-dependent myopathy, the dys-1; hlh-1 worms should permit the identification of genes, and ultimately drugs, that would reverse the muscle degeneration in this model.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dysferlin, the protein product of the gene mutated in patients with an autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) and a distal muscular dystrophy, Miyoshi myopathy, is homologous to a Caenorhabditis elegans spermatogenesis factor, FER-1. Analysis of fer-1 mutants and of sequence predictions of the FER-1 and dysferlin ORFs has predicted a role in membrane fusion. Otoferlin, another human FER-1-like protein (ferlin), has recently been shown to be responsible for autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness (DFNB9). In this report we describe the third human ferlin gene, FER1L3, which maps to chromosome 10q23.3. Expression analysis of the orthologous mouse gene shows ubiquitous expression but predominant expression in the eye, esophagus, and salivary gland. All the ferlins are characterized by sequences corresponding to multiple C2 domains that share the highest level of homology with the C2A domain of rat synaptotagmin III. They are predicted to be Type II transmembrane proteins, with the majority of the protein facing the cytoplasm anchored by the C-terminal transmembrane domain. Sequence and predicted structural comparisons have highlighted the high degree of similarity of dysferlin and FER1L3, which have sequences corresponding to six C2 domains and which share more than 60% amino acid sequence identity.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The syntrophins are a family of structurally related proteins that contain multiple protein interaction motifs. Syntrophins associate directly with dystrophin, the product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus, and its homologues. We have generated alpha-syntrophin null mice by targeted gene disruption to test the function of this association. The alpha-Syn(-/)-mice show no evidence of myopathy, despite reduced levels of alpha-dystrobrevin-2. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase, a component of the dystrophin protein complex, is absent from the sarcolemma of the alpha-Syn(-/)-mice, even where other syntrophin isoforms are present. alpha-Syn(-/)-neuromuscular junctions have undetectable levels of postsynaptic utrophin and reduced levels of acetylcholine receptor and acetylcholinesterase. The mutant junctions have shallow nerve gutters, abnormal distributions of acetylcholine receptors, and postjunctional folds that are generally less organized and have fewer openings to the synaptic cleft than controls. Thus, alpha-syntrophin has an important role in synapse formation and in the organization of utrophin, acetylcholine receptor, and acetylcholinesterase at the neuromuscular synapse.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the molecular basis of a mitochondrial myopathy associated with recurrent myoglobinuria and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency in muscle. BACKGROUND: Recurrent myoglobinuria is typically seen in patients with inborn errors of carbohydrate or lipid metabolism, the main sources of energy for muscle contraction. Relatively little attention has been directed to defects of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in patients with otherwise unexplained recurrent myoglobinuria. METHODS: Having documented COX deficiency histochemically and biochemically in the muscle biopsy from a patient with exercise-induced recurrent myoglobinuria, the authors sequenced the three mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded COX genes, and performed restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and single-fiber PCR. RESULTS: The authors identified a nonsense mutation (G5920A) in the COX I gene in muscle mtDNA. The mutation was heteroplasmic and abundantly present in COX-negative fibers, but less abundant or absent in COX-positive fibers; it was not found in blood or fibroblasts from the patient or in blood samples from the patient's asymptomatic mother and sister. CONCLUSIONS: The G5920A mutation caused COX deficiency in muscle, explaining the exercise intolerance and the low muscle capacity for oxidative phosphorylation documented by cycle ergometry. The sporadic occurrence of this mutation in muscle alone suggests that it arose de novo in myogenic stem cells after germ-layer differentiation. Mutations in mtDNA-encoded COX genes should be considered in patients with recurrent myoglobinuria.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotonic dystrophy (DM), the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adult humans, results from expansion of a CTG repeat in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. The mutant DMPK messenger RNA (mRNA) contains an expanded CUG repeat and is retained in the nucleus. We have expressed an untranslated CUG repeat in an unrelated mRNA in transgenic mice. Mice that expressed expanded CUG repeats developed myotonia and myopathy, whereas mice expressing a nonexpanded repeat did not. Thus, transcripts with expanded CUG repeats are sufficient to generate a DM phenotype. This result supports a role for RNA gain of function in disease pathogenesis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We have identified a mutation in the myotilin gene in a large North American family of German descent expressing an autosomal dominant form of limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD1A). We have previously mapped this gene to 5q31. Symptoms of this adult onset disease are progressive weakness of the hip and shoulder girdles, as well as a distinctive dysarthric pattern of speech. Muscle of affected individuals shows degeneration of myofibers, variations in fiber size, fiber splitting, centrally located myonuclei and a large number of autophagic vesicles. Affected muscle also exhibits disorganization and streaming of the Z-line similar to that seen in nemaline myopathy. We have identified a C450T missense mutation in the myotilin gene that is predicted to result in the conversion of residue 57 from threonine to isoleucine. This mutation has not been found in 396 control chromosomes. The mutant allele is transcribed and normal levels of correctly localized myotilin protein are seen in LGMD1A muscle. Myotilin is a sarcomeric protein that binds to alpha-actinin and is localized in the Z-line. The observed missense mutation does not disrupt binding to alpha-actinin.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The nemaline myopathies are characterized by weakness and eosinophilic, rodlike (nemaline) inclusions in muscle fibers. Amish nemaline myopathy is a form of nemaline myopathy common among the Old Order Amish. In the first months of life, affected infants have tremors with hypotonia and mild contractures of the shoulders and hips. Progressive worsening of the proximal contractures, weakness, and a pectus carinatum deformity develop before the children die of respiratory insufficiency, usually in the second year. The disorder has an incidence of approximately 1 in 500 among the Amish, and it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Using a genealogy database, automated pedigree software, and linkage analysis of DNA samples from four sibships, we identified an approximately 2-cM interval on chromosome 19q13.4 that was homozygous in all affected individuals. The gene for the sarcomeric thin-filament protein, slow skeletal muscle troponin T (TNNT1), maps to this interval and was sequenced. We identified a stop codon in exon 11, predicted to truncate the protein at amino acid 179, which segregates with the disease. We conclude that Amish nemaline myopathy is a distinct, heritable, myopathic disorder caused by a mutation in TNNT1.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>INTRODUCTION: Myotonic dystrophy is caused by expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat on human chromosome 19, and leads to progressive skeletal myopathy and atrioventricular conduction disturbances. A murine model of myotonic dystrophy has been designed by targeted disruption of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene. The DMPK-deficient mice display abnormalities in A-V conduction characteristics, similar to the human cardiac phenotype. The purpose of this study was to determine whether age-related progression of A-V block occurs in a mouse model of DMPK-deficiency. METHODS AND RESULTS: Surface ECGs and intracardiac electrophysiology (EP) studies were performed in 60 immature and 90 adult homozygous (DMPK-/-), heterozygous (DMPK+/-), and wild-type (WT) DMPK+/+ control mice. Complete studies were obtained on 141 of 150 mice. The RR, PR, QRS, and QT intervals were measured on ECG. Sinus node recovery time, AV refractory periods, paced AV Wenckebach and 2:1 block cycle lengths, atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods were compared between genotypes and age groups. There were no differences in ECG intervals or EP findings in the young mutant mice, but progressive PR prolongation in older mice. The A-V conduction defects are also sensitive to DMPK gene dosage. Adult DMPK-/-mice develop 1 degrees, 2 degrees and 3 degrees A-V block, whereas DMPK+/-mice develop only 1 degrees heart block. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that both age and DMPK dose are important factors regulating cardiac conduction in myotonic dystrophy. This mouse model of DM is remarkably similar to the human phenotype, with age-related progression in atrioventricular conduction defects.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Desmin myopathy is a familial or sporadic disorder characterized by intracytoplasmic accumulation of desmin in the muscle cells. We and others have previously identified desmin gene mutations in patients with familial myopathy, but close to 45% of the patients do not report previous family history of the disease. The present study was conducted to determine the cause of desmin myopathy in a sporadic patient presenting with symmetrical muscle weakness and atrophy combined with atrioventricular conduction block requiring a permanent pacemaker. A novel heterozygous R406W mutation in the desmin gene was identified by sequencing cDNA and genomic DNA. Expression of a construct containing the patient's mutant desmin cDNA in SW13 (vim-) cells demonstrated a high pathogenic potential of the R406W mutation. This mutation was not found in the patient's father, mother or sister by sequencing and restriction analysis. Testing with five microsatellite markers and four intragenic single nucleotide polymorphisms excluded alternative paternity. Haplotype analysis indicates that the patient's father was germ-line mosaic for the desmin mutation. We conclude that de novo mutations in the desmin gene may be the cause of sporadic forms of desmin-related cardiac and skeletal myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate [PI(3)P] plays a crucial role in intracellular membrane trafficking. We report here that myotubularin, a protein tyrosine phosphatase required for muscle cell differentiation, is a potent PI(3)P phosphatase. Recombinant human myotubularin specifically dephosphorylates PI(3)P in vitro. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive substrate-trapping myotubularin mutant (C375S) in human 293 cells increases PI(3)P levels relative to that of cells overexpressing the wild-type enzyme, demonstrating that PI(3)P is a substrate for myotubularin in vivo. In addition, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain in which the myotubularin-like gene (YJR110w) is disrupted also exhibits increased PI(3)P levels. Both the recombinant yeast enzyme and a human myotubularin-related protein (KIAA0371) are able to dephosphorylate PI(3)P in vitro, suggesting that this activity is intrinsic to all myotubularin family members. Mutations in the MTM1 gene that cause human myotubular myopathy dramatically reduce the ability of the phosphatase to dephosphorylate PI(3)P. Our findings provide evidence that myotubularin exerts its effects during myogenesis by regulating cellular levels of the inositol lipid PI(3)P.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Adult-onset carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by muscle pain and stiffness with rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria in severe cases. Exercise, fasting, viral infection, anesthesia, or extremes in temperature may trigger symptoms. A 54-year-old woman exhibited a 35-year history of progressive weakness and myopathic symptoms. CPT II activity in the patient's lymphoblasts, cultured skin fibroblasts, and skeletal muscle was reduced to 47, 43, and 13% of normal, respectively. Respiratory chain enzymes were also reduced in muscle ranging from 22 to 49% of their respective normal reference means. beta-oxidation enzymes in fibroblasts ranged from 29 to 63% of normal. The patient, her father, and her 26-year-old son were all heterozygous for the R503C mutation. The patient's son has a lifelong history of myopathic symptoms while his grandfather only had mild weakness during childhood. Analysis of the V368I and M647V polymorphisms in the CPT2 gene showed that the mutant allele is linked to 368I and 647M in this family and that the normal allele is linked to 647V in the affected patient and her son, and to 647M in the patient's father. While the variability in CPT2 gene haplotypes may contribute to the phenotypic complexities in this family, it is also possible that an additional gene defect in the transport of mitochondrial proteins contributes to the complex phenotype in the patient. We present biochemical and molecular evidence for vertical transmission of a variable myopathy caused by heterozygosity for a single mutation, R503C, in the CPT2 gene.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Recent studies on the IF(1) inhibitor protein of the mitochondrial F(1)F(0)-ATPase from molecular biochemistry to possible pathophysiological roles are reviewed. The apparent mechanism of IF(1) inhibition of F(1)F(0)-ATPase activity and the biophysical conditions that influence IF(1) activity are summarized. The amino acid sequences of human, bovine, rat and murine IF(1) are compared and domains and residues implicated in IF(1) function examined. Defining the minimal inhibitory sequence of IF(1) and the role of conserved histidines and conformational changes using peptides or recombinant IF(1) is reviewed. Luft's disease, a mitochondrial myopathy where IF(1) is absent, is described with respect to IF(1) relevance to mitochondrial bioenergetics and clinical observations. The possible pathophysiological role of IF(1) in conserving ATP under conditions where cells experience oxygen deprivation (tumor growth, myocardial ischemia) is evaluated. Finally, studies attempting to correlate IF(1) activity to ATP conservation in myocardial ischemic preconditioning are compared.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A defect of the gene for p94 (calpain 3), a skeletal muscle-specific calpain, is responsible for limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A), or 'calpainopathy', which is an autosomal recessive and progressive neuromuscular disorder. To study the relationships between the physiological functions of p94 and the etiology of LGMD2A, we created transgenic mice that express an inactive mutant of p94, in which the active site Cys129 is replaced by Ser (p94:C129S). Three lines of transgenic mice expressing p94:C129S mRNA at various levels showed significantly decreased grip strength. Sections of soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of the aged transgenic mice showed increased numbers of lobulated and split fibers, respectively, which are often observed in limb girdle muscular dystrophy muscles. Centrally placed nuclei were also frequently found in the EDL muscle of the transgenic mice, whereas wild-type mice of the same age had almost none. There was more p94 protein produced in aged transgenic mice muscles and it showed significantly less autolytic degradation activity than that of wild-type mice. Although no necrotic-regenerative fibers were observed, the age and p94:C129S expression dependence of the phenotypes strongly suggest that accumulation of p94:C129S protein causes these myopathy phenotypes. The p94:C129S transgenic mice could provide us with crucial information on the molecular mech-anism of LGMD2A.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3' UTR of the gene DMPK at the DM1 locus on chromosome 19 causes myotonic dystrophy, a dominantly inherited disease characterized by skeletal muscle dystrophy and myotonia, cataracts and cardiac conduction defects. Targeted deletion of Dm15, the mouse orthologue of human DMPK, produced mice with a mild myopathy and cardiac conduction abnormalities, but without other features of myotonic dystrophy, such as myotonia and cataracts. We, and others, have demonstrated that repeat expansion decreases expression of the adjacent gene SIX5 (refs 7,8), which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor. To determine whether SIX5 deficiency contributes to the myotonic dystrophy phenotype, we disrupted mouse Six5 by replacing the first exon with a beta-galactosidase reporter. Six5-mutant mice showed reporter expression in multiple tissues, including the developing lens. Homozygous mutant mice had no apparent abnormalities of skeletal muscle function, but developed lenticular opacities at a higher rate than controls. Our results suggest that SIX5 deficiency contributes to the cataract phenotype in myotonic dystrophy, and that myotonic dystrophy represents a multigenic disorder.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myocyte nuclear factor (MNF) is a winged helix transcription factor that is expressed selectively in myogenic stem cells (satellite cells) of adult animals. Using a gene knockout strategy to generate a functional null allele at the Mnf locus, we observed that mice lacking MNF are viable, but severely runted. Skeletal muscles of Mnf-/-animals are atrophic, and satellite cell function is impaired. Muscle regeneration after injury is delayed and incomplete, and the normal timing of expression of cell cycle regulators and myogenic determination genes is dysregulated. Mnf mutant mice were intercrossed with mdx mice that lack dystrophin and exhibit only a subtle myopathic phenotype. In contrast, mdx mice that also lack MNF die in the first few weeks of life with a severe myopathy. Haploinsufficiency at the Mnf locus (Mnf+/-) also exacerbates the mdx phenotype to more closely resemble Duchenne's muscular dystrophy in humans. We conclude that MNF acts to regulate genes that coordinate the proliferation and differentiation of myogenic stem cells after muscle injury. Animals deficient in MNF may prove useful for evaluation of potential therapeutic interventions to promote muscle regeneration for patients having Duchenne's muscular dystrophy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM; MIM# 310400) is a severe congenital muscle disorder caused by mutations in the MTM1 gene. This gene encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase named myotubularin, defining a large gene family highly conserved through evolution (which includes the putative anti-phosphatase Sbf1/hMTMR5). We report 29 mutations in novel cases, including 16 mutations not described before. To date, 198 mutations have been identified in unrelated families, accounting for 133 different disease-associated mutations which are widespread throughout the gene. Most point mutations are truncating, but 26% (35/133) are missense mutations affecting residues conserved in the Drosophila ortholog and in the homologous MTMR1 gene. Three recurrent mutations affect 17% of the patients, and a total of 21 different mutations were found in several independent families. The frequency of female carriers appears higher than expected (only 17% are de novo mutations). While most truncating mutations cause the severe and early lethal phenotype, some missense mutations are associated with milder forms and prolonged survival (up to 54 years).</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The mouse p locus encodes a gene that functions in normal pigmentation. We have characterized a radiation-induced mutant allele of the mouse p locus that is associated with a failure-to-thrive syndrome, in addition to diminished pigmentation. Mice homozygous for this mutant allele, p(100H), show delayed growth and die within 2 wk after birth. We have discovered that the mutant mice develop progressive atrioventricular heart block and significant ultrastructural changes in both cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. These observations are common characteristics described in human myopathies. The karyotype of p(100H) chromosomes indicated that the mutation is associated with a chromosome 7 inversion. We demonstrate here that the p(100H) chromosomal inversion disrupts both the p gene and the Sox6 gene. Normal Sox6 gene expression has been examined by Northern blot analysis and was found most abundantly expressed in skeletal muscle in adult mouse tissues, suggesting an involvement of Sox6 in muscle maintenance. The p(100H) mutant is thus a useful animal model in the elucidation of myopathies at the molecular level.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Myofibrillar myopathies, often referred to as desmin-related myopathies, are a heterogeneous group of inherited or sporadic distal-onset skeletal myopathies associated with cardiomyopathy. Among the myofibrillar proteins that characteristically accumulate within the muscle fibers of affected patients, the one found most consistently is desmin, a muscle-specific intermediate-filament protein responsible for the structural integrity of the myofibrils. Skeletal and cardiac myopathy develops in mice that lack desmin, suggesting that mutations in the desmin gene may be pathogenic. METHODS: We examined 22 patients from 8 families with dominantly inherited myofibrillar or desmin-related myopathy and 2 patients with sporadic disease and analyzed the desmin gene for mutations, using complementary DNA (cDNA) amplified from muscle-biopsy specimens and genomic DNA extracted from blood lymphocytes. Restriction-enzyme analysis was used to confirm the mutations. Expression vectors containing normal or mutant desmin cDNA were introduced into cultured cells to determine whether the mutant desmin formed intermediate filaments. RESULTS: Six missense mutations in the coding region of the desmin gene that cause the substitution of an amino acid were identified in 11 patients (10 members of 4 families and 1 patient with sporadic disease); a splicing defect that resulted in the deletion of exon 3 was identified in the other patient with sporadic disease. Mutations were clustered in the carboxy-terminal part of the rod domain, which is critical for filament assembly. In transfected cells, the mutant desmin was unable to form a filamentous network. Seven of the 12 patients with mutations in the desmin gene had cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in the desmin gene affecting intermediate filaments cause a distinct myopathy that is often associated with cardiomyopathy and is termed "desmin myopathy." The mutant desmin interferes with the normal assembly of intermediate filaments, resulting in fragility of the myofibrils and severe dysfunction of skeletal and cardiac muscles.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Primary carnitine deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder of fatty acid oxidation caused by defective carnitine transport. This disease can present early in life with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and acute metabolic decompensation, or later in life with skeletal or cardiac myopathy. Mutations abolishing the function of OCTN2, an organic cation/carnitine transporter with twelve putative transmembrane spanning domains, were recently demonstrated in patients with early- and late-onset (up to seven years of age) presentation of this syndrome. Most of the reported mutations are null alleles. Here we evaluate the OCTN2 gene in a male patient who presented at seven years of age with severe dilated cardiomyopathy. Plasma carnitine levels were undetectable and carnitine transport by his fibroblasts was reduced to about 3% of normal controls. This patient was homozygous for a single base pair change in exon 8 of the OCTN2 gene (1354G>A) converting the codon for Glu 452 to Lys (E452K) in the predicted intracellular loop between transmembrane domains 10 and 11. Stable expression of the mutant E452K-OCTN2 cDNA in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells caused a partial increase in carnitine transport to 2-4% of the levels measured in the wild type transporter. This reduced transport activity was associated with normal Km toward carnitine (3.1 +/-1.1 microM), but markedly reduced Vmax. These results indicate that primary carnitine deficiency can be caused by mutations encoding for carnitine transporters with residual activity, and that the E452K affects a domain not involved in carnitine recognition.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report a novel beta-sarcoglycan gene mutation identified in a 21-year-old Portuguese male with a progressive myopathy of intermediate severity, who had been misdiagnosed as Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) based on clinical observations and muscle immunocytochemical anaylsis with dystrophin antibodies only. Since no detectable deletions or duplications were found in the dystrophin gene, we screened for mutations in the sarcoglycan genes by PCR-SSCP. The patient's sample showed a band of increased mobility in exon 4 of the beta-sarcoglycan gene which, upon sequencing, was found to represent a homozygous A-->G transversion at nucleotide 551, resulting in a tyrosine to cysteine substitution at position 184 (Y184C). Carrier status was ascertained in both parents and a sister. These aberrant conformers were not detected in 85 unrelated control individuals screened by PCR-SSCP analysis. All seven beta-sarcoglycan mutations reported to date are associated with a severe phenotype and occur in exons 3 and 4, which correspond to the immediate extracellular domain of the protein. This region contains five conserved cysteine residues. In our patient, the presence of an extra cysteine residue could interefere with intra-and/or inter-molecular disulphide bond formation. The intermediate phenotype could perhaps result from the assembly of both normal and abnormal complexes, depending on the formation of the disulphide bonds.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Primary systemic carnitine deficiency (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder of fatty acid oxidation caused by defective cellular carnitine transport. The disease is characterized by metabolic derangement simulating Reye's syndrome, hypoglcaemia, progressive cardiomyopathy and skeletal myopathy. Recently, it was shown that SCD is caused by mutations in the organic cation/carnitine transporter OCTN2 (SLC22A5). We report two novel mutations, W283R and V446F, which are both missense mutations in an affected infant. In vitro expression studies demonstrated that both are actually function-loss mutations with virtually no uptake activity. This is the first report of compound heterozygosity for two missense mutations in a patient with SCD. Hum Mutat 15:118, 2000.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Desmin is the muscle-specific member of the intermediate filament family of cytoskeletal proteins, expressed both in striated and smooth muscle tissues. In mature striated muscle fibers, the desmin filament lattice surrounds the Z-discs, interconnects them to each other and links the entire contractile apparatus to the sarcolemmal cytoskeleton, cytoplasmic organelles and the nucleus. There have been increasing reports of human cardiomyopathies associated with abnormal accumulation and aggregation of desmin filaments. Recently identified desmin mutations in humans suffering from skeletal muscle myopathy and cardiomyopathy suggest that these diseases might arise as a consequence of impaired function of desmin filaments. Previous generation of desmin null mice in our laboratory demonstrated that the absence of desmin results in myocyte ultrastructural defects and myocyte cell death leading to fibrosis and calcification of the myocardium. However, the effects that these defects have on cardiac function were not addressed. To further our understanding of desmin function in vivo, and in order to address the direct involvement of desmin in cardiomyopathy, we investigated the effect of the absence of desmin on myocardial mass, myocyte size and shape, changes in gene expression and cardiac systolic and diastolic function in mice. Morphometric characterization of isolated cardiomyocytes demonstrated a 24% increase in cell volume in the desmin null mice, solely due to an increase in transverse section area, suggesting for the first time that mice lacking the intermediate filament protein desmin develop concentric cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. This type of hypertrophy was accompanied by induction of embryonic gene expression and later by ventricular dilatation, and compromised systolic function. These results demonstrate that desmin is essential for normal cardiac function, and they suggest that the absence of an intact desmin filament system, rather than accumulation of the protein, may be responsible for the pathology seen in some of the desmin associated cardiomyopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a rare autosomal dominant skeletal muscle myopathy characterized by severe muscle weakness and the subsequent appearance of nemaline rods within the muscle fibers. Recently, a missense mutation inTPM3, which encodes the slow skeletal alpha-tropomyosin (alphaTm), was linked to NM in a large kindred with an autosomal-dominant, childhood-onset form of the disease. We used adenoviral gene transfer to fully differentiated rat adult myocytes in vitro to determine the effects of NM mutant human alphaTm expression on striated muscle sarcomeric structure and contractile function. The mutant alphaTm was expressed and incorporated correctly into sarcomeres of adult muscle cells. The primary defect caused by expression of the mutant alphaTm was a decrease in the sensitivity of contraction to activating Ca(2+), which could help explain the hypotonia seen in NM. Interestingly, NM mutant alphaTm expression did not directly result in nemaline rod formation, which suggests that rod formation is secondary to contractile dysfunction and that load-dependent processes are likely involved in nemaline rod formation in vivo.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Inherited mutations cause approximately 35 percent of cases of dilated cardiomyopathy; however, few genes associated with this disease have been identified. Previously, we located a gene defect that was responsible for autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction-system disease on chromosome 1p1-q21, where nuclear-envelope proteins lamin A and lamin C are encoded by the LMNA (lamin A/C) gene. Mutations in the head or tail domain of this gene cause Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, a childhood-onset disease characterized by joint contractures and in some cases by abnormalities of cardiac conduction during adulthood. METHODS: We evaluated 11 families with autosomal dominant dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction-system disease. Sequences of the lamin A/C exons were determined in probands from each family, and variants were confirmed by restriction-enzyme digestion. The genotypes of the family members were ascertained. RESULTS: Five novel missense mutations were identified: four in the alpha-helical-rod domain of the lamin A/C gene, and one in the lamin C tail domain. Each mutation caused heritable, progressive conduction-system disease (sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular conduction block, or atrial arrhythmias) and dilated cardiomyopathy. Heart failure and sudden death occurred frequently within these families. No family members with mutations had either joint contractures or skeletal myopathy. Serum creatine kinase levels were normal in family members with mutations of the lamin rod but mildly elevated in some family members with a defect in the tail domain of lamin C. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic defects in distinct domains of the nuclear-envelope proteins lamin A and lamin C selectively cause dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction-system disease or autosomal dominant Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Missense mutations in the rod domain of the lamin A/C gene provide a genetic cause for dilated cardiomyopathy and indicate that this intermediate filament protein has an important role in cardiac conduction and contractility.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>This report describes a congenital myopathy and major loss of thymic lymphocytes in ankyrin-B (-/-) mice as well as dramatic alterations in intracellular localization of key components of the Ca(2+) homeostasis machinery in ankyrin-B (-/-) striated muscle and thymus. The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and SR/T-tubule junctions are apparently preserved in a normal distribution in ankyrin-B (-/-) skeletal muscle based on electron microscopy and the presence of a normal pattern of triadin and dihydropyridine receptor. Therefore, the abnormal localization of SR/ER Ca ATPase (SERCA) and ryanodine receptors represents a defect in intracellular sorting of these proteins in skeletal muscle. Extrapolation of these observations suggests defective targeting as the basis for abnormal localization of ryanodine receptors, IP3 receptors and SERCA in heart, and of IP3 receptors in the thymus of ankyrin-B (-/-) mice. Mis-sorting of SERCA 2 and ryanodine receptor 2 in ankyrin-B (-/-) cardiomyocytes is rescued by expression of 220-kD ankyrin-B, demonstrating that lack of the 220-kD ankyrin-B polypeptide is the primary defect in these cells. Ankyrin-B is associated with intracellular vesicles, but is not colocalized with the bulk of SERCA 1 or ryanodine receptor type 1 in skeletal muscle. These data provide the first evidence of a physiological requirement for ankyrin-B in intracellular targeting of the calcium homeostasis machinery of striated muscle and immune system, and moreover, support a catalytic role that does not involve permanent stoichiometric complexes between ankyrin-B and targeted proteins. Ankyrin-B is a member of a family of adapter proteins implicated in restriction of diverse proteins to specialized plasma membrane domains. Similar mechanisms involving ankyrins may be essential for segregation of functionally defined proteins within specialized regions of the plasma membrane and within the Ca(2+) homeostasis compartment of the ER.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In some myopathies of distal onset, the intermediate filament desmin is abnormally accumulated in skeletal and cardiac muscle. We report the first point mutation in desmin cosegregating with an autosomal dominant form of desmin-related myopathy. The L345P desmin missense mutation occurs in a large, six generation Ashkenazi Jewish family. The mutation is located in an evolutionarily highly conserved position of the desmin coiled-coil rod domain important for dimer formation. L345P desmin is incapable of forming filamentous networks in transfected HeLa and SW13 cells. We conclude that the L345P desmin missense mutation causes myopathy by interfering in a dominant-negative manner with the dimerization-polymerization process of intermediate filament assembly.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We have identified a novel missense mutation in the gene for glycogen branching enzyme (GBE 1) in a 16-month-old infant with a combination of hepatic and muscular features, an atypical clinical presentation of glycogenosis type IV (GSD IV). The patient was heterozygous for a G-to-A substitution at codon 524 (R524Q), changing an encoded arginine (CGA) to glutamine (CAA), while the GBE1 gene on the other allele was not expressed. This case broadens the spectrum of mutations in patients with GSD IV and confirms the clinical and molecular heterogeneity of this disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Muscle-specific phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM-M) deficiency results in a metabolic myopathy (glycogenosis type X). Three mutations in the PGAM-M gene have been described thus far, two in African-American families and one in a Caucasian family. In two of them, manifesting heterozygotes were documented. We found a new PGAM-M mutation in a Japanese family with partial PGAM deficiency: a G-to-A transition at nucleotide position 209, resulting in the substitution of a highly conserved glycine at codon 97 with aspartic acid (G97D). Two heterozygous family members for the G97D mutation presented with exercise intolerance and muscle cramps. We describe the first PGAM-M mutation in the Japanese population and confirm that heterozygous individuals can be symptomatic.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The mdx mouse, an animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, develops an X-linked recessive inflammatory myopathy. During onset of disease and height of myonecrosis, mdx mice also display important changes in the microenvironment of lymphoid tissues. Draining lymph nodes showed reduced cellularity and atrophy accompanied by intense immunolabeling for fibronectin, laminin, and type-IV collagen. Following clinical amelioration of dystrophy, mdx mice showed enhanced cellularity and a consistent increase in the absolute numbers of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells expressing alpha4(high) and alpha5(high) extracellular matrix receptors. Furthermore, infiltrating cells in the proximity of myonecrosis expressed alpha4, alpha5, and alpha6 integrin chains during both height of myonecrosis and muscular tissue regeneration. Such results indicate that during distinct phases of muscular dystrophy, altered expression of extracellular matrix ligands and receptors may be influencing myonecrosis by promoting adhesion and migration of mononuclear cells into the altered skeletal muscle and toward local draining lymphoid tissue.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Muscle contraction results from the force generated between the thin filament protein actin and the thick filament protein myosin, which causes the thick and thin muscle filaments to slide past each other. There are skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, smooth muscle and non-muscle isoforms of both actin and myosin. Inherited diseases in humans have been associated with defects in cardiac actin (dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), cardiac myosin (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) and non-muscle myosin (deafness). Here we report that mutations in the human skeletal muscle alpha-actin gene (ACTA1) are associated with two different muscle diseases, 'congenital myopathy with excess of thin myofilaments' (actin myopathy) and nemaline myopathy. Both diseases are characterized by structural abnormalities of the muscle fibres and variable degrees of muscle weakness. We have identified 15 different missense mutations resulting in 14 different amino acid changes. The missense mutations in ACTA1 are distributed throughout all six coding exons, and some involve known functional domains of actin. Approximately half of the patients died within their first year, but two female patients have survived into their thirties and have children. We identified dominant mutations in all but 1 of 14 families, with the missense mutations being single and heterozygous. The only family showing dominant inheritance comprised a 33-year-old affected mother and her two affected and two unaffected children. In another family, the clinically unaffected father is a somatic mosaic for the mutation seen in both of his affected children. We identified recessive mutations in one family in which the two affected siblings had heterozygous mutations in two different exons, one paternally and the other maternally inherited. We also identified de novo mutations in seven sporadic probands for which it was possible to analyse parental DNA.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a congenital muscular disease characterized by severe hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness, leading in most cases to early postnatal death. The gene responsible for the disease, MTM1, encodes a dual specificity phosphatase, named myotubularin, which is highly conserved throughout evolution. To date, 139 MTM1 mutations in independent patients have been reported, corresponding to 93 different mutations. In this report we describe the identification of 21 mutations (14 novel) in XLMTM patients. Seventeen mutations are associated with a severe phenotype in males, with death occurring mainly before the first year of life. However, four mutations-three missense (R241C, I225T, and novel mutation P179S) and one single-amino acid deletion (G294del)-were found in patients with a much milder phenotype. These patients, while having a severe hypotonia at birth, are still alive at the age of 4, 7, 13, and 15 years, respectively, and display mild to moderate muscle weakness.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: The mitochondrial myopathies typically affect many organ systems and are associated with mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that are maternally inherited. However, there is also a sporadic form of mitochondrial myopathy in which exercise intolerance is the predominant symptom. We studied the biochemical and molecular characteristics of this sporadic myopathy. METHODS: We sequenced the mtDNA cytochrome b gene in blood and muscle specimens from five patients with severe exercise intolerance, lactic acidosis in the resting state (in four patients), and biochemical evidence of complex III deficiency. We compared the clinical and molecular features of these patients with those previously described in four other patients with mutations in the cytochrome b gene. RESULTS: We found a total of three different nonsense mutations (G15084A, G15168A, and G15723A), one missense mutation (G14846A), and a 24-bp deletion (from nucleotide 15498 to 15521) in the cytochrome b gene in the five patients. Each of these mutations impairs the enzymatic function of the cytochrome b protein. In these patients and those previously described, the clinical manifestations included progressive exercise intolerance, proximal limb weakness, and in some cases, attacks of myoglobinuria. There was no maternal inheritance and there were no mutations in tissues other than muscle. The absence of these findings suggests that the disorder is due to somatic mutations in myogenic stem cells after germ-layer differentiation. All the point mutations involved the substitution of adenine for guanine, but all were in different locations. CONCLUSIONS: The sporadic form of mitochondrial myopathy is associated with somatic mutations in the cytochrome b gene of mtDNA. This myopathy is one cause of the common and often elusive syndrome of exercise intolerance.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Recently we reported that mutations in a muscle protein "dysferlin" are present in limb girdle muscular dystrophy-2B and a related, adult-onset, distal dystrophy known as Miyoshi myopathy (MM). We report that antibodies to dysferlin identify a protein of approximately 230 kDa and show that dysferlin is located in the muscle membrane. This protein is absent in MM and LGMD-2B muscle. By contrast, dystrophin and other dystrophin-associated proteins are normal in these patients. Thus, dysferlin is a membrane-associated protein that is not likely to be an integral component of the dystrophin complex. Although it is not essential for initial myogenesis, it appears to be critical for sustained normal function in mature muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report the first missense mutation in the mtDNA gene for subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase (COX). The mutation was identified in a 14-year-old boy with a proximal myopathy and lactic acidosis. Muscle histochemistry and mitochondrial respiratory-chain enzymology demonstrated a marked reduction in COX activity. Immunohistochemistry and immunoblot analyses with COX subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies showed a pattern suggestive of a primary mtDNA defect, most likely involving CO II, for COX subunit II (COX II). mtDNA-sequence analysis demonstrated a novel heteroplasmic T-->A transversion at nucleotide position 7,671 in CO II. This mutation changes a methionine to a lysine residue in the middle of the first N-terminal membrane-spanning region of COX II. The immunoblot studies demonstrated a severe reduction in cross-reactivity, not only for COX II but also for the mtDNA-encoded subunit COX III and for nuclear-encoded subunits Vb, VIa, VIb, and VIc. Steady-state levels of the mtDNA-encoded subunit COX I showed a mild reduction, but spectrophotometric analysis revealed a dramatic decrease in COX I-associated heme a3 levels. These observations suggest that, in the COX protein, a structural association of COX II with COX I is necessary to stabilize the binding of heme a3 to COX I.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Malignant hyperthermia (MH) in man is an autosomal dominant disorder of skeletal muscle Ca(2+)-regulation. During anesthesia in predisposed individuals, it is triggered by volatile anesthetics and depolarizing muscle relaxants. In >50% of the families, MH susceptibility is linked to the gene encoding the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1), the calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, on chromosome 19q12-13.2. To date, 21 RYR1 mutations have been identified in a number of pedigrees. Four of them are also associated with central core disease (CCD), a congenital myopathy. Screening for these 21 mutations in 105 MH families including 10 CCD families phenotyped by the in vitro contracture test (IVCT) according to the European protocol revealed the following approximate distribution: 9% Arg-614-Cys, 1% Arg-614-Leu, 1% Arg-2163-Cys, 1% Val-2168-Met, 3% Thr-2206-Met and 7% Gly-2434-Arg. In one CCD family, the disease was caused by a recently reported MH mutation, Arg-2454-His. Two novel mutations, Thr-2206-Arg and Arg-2454-Cys were detected, each in a single pedigree. In the 109 individuals of the 25 families with RYR1 mutations cosegregation between genetic result and IVCT was almost perfect, only three genotypes were discordant with the IVCT phenotypes, suggesting a true sensitivity of 98.5% and a specificity of minimally 81.8% for this test. Screening of the transmembraneous region of RYR1 did not yield a new mutation confirming the cytosolic portion of the protein to be of main functional importance for disease pathogenesis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Systemic carnitine deficiency is a potentially lethal, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by cardiomyopathy, myopathy, recurrent episodes of hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and failure to thrive. This form of carnitine deficiency is caused by a defect in the active cellular uptake of carnitine, and the gene encoding the high affinity carnitine transporter OCTN2 has recently been shown to be mutated in patients suffering from this disorder. Here, we report the underlying molecular defect in three unrelated patients. Two patients were homozygous for the same missense mutation 632A-->G, which changes the tyrosine at amino acid position 211 into a cysteine (Y211C). The third patient was homozygous for a nonsense mutation, 844C-->T, which converts the arginine at amino acid position 282 into a stop codon (R282X). Reintroduction of wild-type OCTN2 cDNA into fibroblasts of the three patients by transient transfection restored the cellular carnitine uptake, confirming that mutations in OCTN2 are the cause of systemic carnitine deficiency.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM; OMIM310400) is a congenital muscle disorder characterized by severe hypotonia and respiratory insufficiency. The disorder was mapped to Xq28 by linkage studies and the MTM1 gene was isolated by positional cloning. The gene product is a 603 amino acid protein named myotubularin. A small domain in its sequence shows high homology to a consensus active site of tyrosine phosphatases, a diverse class of proteins involved in signal transduction, control of cell growth, and differentiation. In this report, two brothers affected with XLMTM are shown to have a point mutation (G1187A) in exon 11 of the MTM1 gene. Surprisingly, their mother does not have this mutation in her lymphocytes. Therefore, she likely has a germline mosaicism. As this is the third report of germline mosaicism in XLMTM, the finding has important implications for genetic counseling.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We have determined the structure and the exon size pattern of the human integrin alpha7 subunit gene (ITGA7), which has been shown to be affected in a form of congenital myopathy. The gene is composed of at least 27 exons spanning a region of about 22.5 kb. The sequence of all exon/intron boundaries was determined and conforms to the GT/AG splicing consensus. We investigated the different splicing forms previously described in human and rodents. The major cytoplasmic variants alpha7A and alpha7B, which are developmentally regulated and tissue specific, were identified in human tissues, as well as the extracellular isoforms X1 and X2. The recently described D variant was detected in adult tissues by RT-PCR but not the C variant. We localized ITGA7 on chromosome 12q13 by high-resolution radiation hybrid mapping between D12S312 and D12S90 and identified a new CA-repeat microsatellite in intron 1.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Bethlem myopathy is an autosomal dominant inherited disease producing a mild neuromuscular disorder, characterized mainly by muscular weakness and multiple joint contractures. Bethlem myopathy is caused by mutations in one of the three chains of collagen type VI. Here we report the clinical description and the molecular characterization of the defect in a two-generation Italian family in which a Gly-->Arg substitution disrupts the triple helix structure of the alpha 3 chain of collagen type VI, an ubiquitous glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix. In this family the identification of the mutation also allowed one to exclude the disease in the grandfather. It is noteworthy that the father of the proband carries a de novo mutation, the first described for Bethlem myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The striated muscle sarcomeres are highly organized structures composed of actin (thin) and myosin (thick) filaments that slide past each other during contraction. The integrity of sarcomeres is controlled by a set of structural proteins, among which are titin, a giant molecule that contains several immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains and associates with thin and thick filaments, and [alpha]-actinin, an actin cross-linking protein. Mutations in several sarcomeric and sarcolemmal proteins have been shown to result in muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy. On the other hand, the disease genes underlying several disease forms remain to be identified. Here we describe a novel 57 kDa cytoskeletal protein, myotilin. Its N-terminal sequence is unique, but the C-terminal half contains two Ig-like domains homologous to titin. Myotilin is expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, it co-localizes with [alpha]-actinin in the sarcomeric I--bands and directly interacts with [alpha]-actinin. The human myotilin gene maps to chromosome 5q31 between markers AFM350yB1 and D5S500. The locus of a dominantly inherited limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD1A) resides in an overlapping narrow segment, and a new type of distal myopathy with vocal cord and pharyngeal weakness (VCPMD) has been mapped to the same locus. The muscle specificity and apparent role as a sarcomeric structural protein raise the possibility that defects in the myotilin gene may cause muscular dystrophy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We have isolated a human gene homologous to Drosophila melanogaster rotated abdomen, rt, a poorly viable recessive mutation causing a clockwise twisted abdomen in affected flies due to defects in embryonic muscle development. The human gene, like rt, encodes a protein with high homology to the yeast mannosyl-transferases (Pmts) and has been named POMT1. POMT1 is expressed as a 3.1-kb transcript in all tissues tested, with highest levels in testis and fetal brain. Alternative splicing of several exons in all tissues predicts the generation of several protein isoforms. The most common mRNA variant encodes a 725-aa protein with 40% identity and 62.5% similarity to rt, as well as 30.5% identity and 54% similarity to yeast Pmts. Computer prediction of protein sorting suggests that the POMT1 product could be an integral protein of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Given the strong conservation of protein motifs between POMT1 and the yeast Pmts, POMT1 may function as a mannosyl-transferase involved in O-mannosylation of proteins, being the first of such a class found in mammals. The POMT1 locus has been assigned to human chromosome 9q34.1 by somatic cell hybrids, radiation hybrids, and linkage analysis. On the basis of the rt phenotype, POMT1 could be a candidate for uncharacterized genetic disorders of the muscular system, such as some forms of congenital muscular dystrophy or congenital myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The myogenin gene encodes an evolutionarily conserved basic helix-loop-helix transcription (bHLH) factor that is required for differentiation of skeletal muscle, and its homozygous deletion in mice results in perinatal death from respiratory failure due to the lack of muscle fibers. Since the histology of skeletal muscle in myogenin null mice is reminiscent of that found in severe congenital myopathy patients, many of whom also die of respiratory complications, we sought to test the hypothesis that an aberrant human myogenin (myf4) coding region could be associated with some congenital myopathy conditions. With PCR amplification, we found similarly sized PCR products for the three exons of the myogenin gene in DNA from 37 patient and 40 control individuals. In contrast to previously reported sequencing of human myogenin (myf4), we describe with automated sequencing several base differences in flanking and coding regions plus an additional 659 and 498 bp in the first and second introns, respectively, in all 37 patient and 40 control samples. We also find a variable length (CA)-dinucleotide repeat in the second intron, which may have utility as a marker for future linkage studies. In summary, no causative mutations were detected in the myogenin coding locus of genomic DNA from 37 patients with severe congenital myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The genetic basis of the relatively mild myopathic symptoms exhibited in a male was investigated. Mutation screening of a candidate gene, MTM1, represented a chance of establishing the molecular defect and the mode of inheritance. SSCA detected variation of the exon b PCR products from the proband and his mother, compared to that observed upon analysis of the PCR products from other members of the family and 159 unrelated X chromosomes. Sequencing revealed a C775 to T transition, in the proband and his mother, but not in his unaffected brother. To confirm the presence of a base change in this region, a Cfol site was introduced into the PCR product of the wildtype allele by using the forward primer 5'-AGAAAATAAGACGGTCATTGcG-3' (mismatch base in small font) with the exon b reverse primer as used by Laporte et al (1996). Analysis of DNA from other members of the family using this method revealed that this is a new mutation in the proband's mother. This mutation would result in a Arg259->Cys substitution.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) and Miyoshi myopathy (MM), a distal muscular dystrophy, are both caused by mutations in the recently cloned gene dysferlin, gene symbol DYSF. Two large pedigrees have been described which have both types of patient in the same families. Moreover, in both pedigrees LGMD2B and MM patients are homozygous for haplotypes of the critical region. This suggested that the same mutation in the same gene would lead to both LGMD2B or MM in these families and that additional factors were needed to explain the development of the different clinical phenotypes. In the present paper we show that in one of these families Pro791 of dysferlin is changed to an Arg residue. Both the LGMD2B and MM patients in this kindred are homozygous for this mutation, as are four additional patients from two previously unpublished families. Haplotype analyses suggest a common origin of the mutation in all the patients. On western blots of muscle, LGMD2B and MM patients show a similar abundance in dysferlin staining of 15 and 11%, respectively. Normal tissue sections show that dysferlin localizes to the sarcolemma while tissue sections from MM and LGMD patients show minimal staining which is indistinguishable between the two types. These findings emphasize the role for the dysferlin gene as being responsible for both LGMD2B and MM, but that the distinction between these two clinical phenotypes requires the identification of additional factor(s), such as modifier gene(s).</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Recently, a single gene, DYSF, has been identified which is mutated in patients with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B (LGMD2B) and with Miyoshi myopathy (MM). This is of interest because these diseases have been considered as two distinct clinical conditions since different muscle groups are the initial targets. Dysferlin, the protein product of the gene, is a novel molecule without homology to any known mammalian protein. We have now raised a monoclonal antibody to dysferlin and report on the expression of this new protein: immunolabelling with the antibody (designated NCL-hamlet) demonstrated a polypeptide of approximately 230 kDa on western blots of skeletal muscle, with localization to the muscle fibre membrane by microscopy at both the light and electron microscopic level. A specific loss of dysferlin labelling was observed in patients with mutations in the LGMD2B/MM gene. Furthermore, patients with two different frameshifting mutations demonstrated very low levels of immunoreactive protein in a manner reminiscent of the dystrophin expressed in many Duchenne patients. Analysis of human fetal tissue showed that dysferlin was expressed at the earliest stages of development examined, at Carnegie stage 15 or 16 (embryonic age 5-6 weeks). Dysferlin is present, therefore, at a time when the limbs start to show regional differentiation. Lack of dysferlin at this critical time may contribute to the pattern of muscle involvement that develops later, with the onset of a muscular dystrophy primarily affecting proximal or distal muscles.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Central core disease is a rare, nonprogressive myopathy that is characterized by hypotonia and proximal muscle weakness. In a large Mexican kindred with an unusually severe and highly penetrant form of the disorder, DNA sequencing identified an I4898T mutation in the C-terminal transmembrane/luminal region of the RyR1 protein that constitutes the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor. All previously reported RYR1 mutations are located either in the cytoplasmic N terminus or in a central cytoplasmic region of the 5,038-aa protein. The I4898T mutation was introduced into a rabbit RYR1 cDNA and expressed in HEK-293 cells. The response of the mutant RyR1 Ca2+ channel to the agonists halothane and caffeine in a Ca2+ photometry assay was completely abolished. Coexpression of normal and mutant RYR1 cDNAs in a 1:1 ratio, however, produced RyR1 channels with normal halothane and caffeine sensitivities, but maximal levels of Ca2+ release were reduced by 67%. [3H]Ryanodine binding indicated that the heterozygous channel is activated by Ca2+ concentrations 4-fold lower than normal. Single-cell analysis of cotransfected cells showed a significantly increased resting cytoplasmic Ca2+ level and a significantly reduced luminal Ca2+ level. These data are indicative of a leaky channel, possibly caused by a reduction in the Ca2+ concentration required for channel activation. Comparison with two other coexpressed mutant/normal channels suggests that the I4898T mutation produces one of the most abnormal RyR1 channels yet investigated, and this level of abnormality is reflected in the severe and penetrant phenotype of affected central core disease individuals.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Genetic defects are being increasingly recognized in the etiology of primary cardiomyopathy (CM). Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) catalyzes the first step in the beta-oxidation spiral of fatty acid metabolism, the crucial pathway for cardiac energy production. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 37 patients with CM, nonketotic hypoglycemia and hepatic dysfunction, skeletal myopathy, or sudden death in infancy with hepatic steatosis, features suggestive of fatty acid oxidation disorders. Single-stranded conformational variance was used to screen genomic DNA. DNA sequencing and mutational analysis revealed 21 different mutations on the VLCAD gene in 18 patients. Of the mutations, 80% were associated with CM. Severe CM in infancy was recognized in most patients (67%) at presentation. Hepatic dysfunction was common (33%). RNA blot analysis and VLCAD enzyme assays showed a severe reduction in VLCAD mRNA in patients with frame-shift or splice-site mutations and absent or severe reduction in enzyme activity in all. CONCLUSIONS: Infantile CM is the most common clinical phenotype of VLCAD deficiency. Mutations in the human VLCAD gene are heterogeneous. Although mortality at presentation is high, both the metabolic disorder and cardiomyopathy are reversible.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a congenital muscle disorder mainly affecting newborn males. Neonatal muscle weakness and hypotonia usually leads to a rapid demise. The responsible gene, MTM1, was isolated in 1996, and mutational data derived from 90 patients have been published. We report on our findings in a further 53 patients, using genomic DNA and mRNA screening protocols. Thirty-four novel mutations were identified in 37 cases, and six known mutations found in 10 other patients. The 34 new mutations include five large deletions, eight nonsense, six frameshift, five missense, and eight splice-site mutations, whereas two intronic variants causing partial exon skipping represent the first report on such a mechanism in MTM1. Two deletions, one involving exon 1, and the second exon 15, are the first defects to be identified in these exons. The heterogeneity of the mutations, their mutational origins, and the varied ethnic backgrounds of the patients, indicate that the majority of XLMTM families are affected by unique MTM1 mutations.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The congenital nemaline myopathies are rare hereditary muscle disorders characterized by the presence in the muscle fibers of nemaline bodies consisting of proteins derived from the Z disc and thin filament. In a single large Australian family with an autosomal dominant form of nemaline myopathy, the disease is caused by a mutation in the alpha-tropomyosin gene TPM3. The typical form of nemaline myopathy is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, the locus of which we previously assigned to chromosome 2q21.2-q22. We show here that mutations in the nebulin gene located within this region are associated with the disease. The nebulin protein is a giant protein found in the thin filaments of striated muscle. A variety of nebulin isoforms are thought to contribute to the molecular diversity of Z discs. We have studied the 3' end of the 20. 8-kb cDNA encoding the Z disc part of the 800-kDa protein and describe six disease-associated mutations in patients from five families of different ethnic origins. In two families with consanguineous parents, the patients were homozygous for point mutations. In one family with nonconsanguineous parents, the affected siblings were compound heterozygotes for two different mutations, and in two further families with one detected mutation each, haplotypes are compatible with compound heterozygosity. Immunofluorescence studies with antibodies specific to the C-terminal region of nebulin indicate that the mutations may cause protein truncation possibly associated with loss of fiber-type diversity, which may be relevant to disease pathogenesis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Oxidative stress has been implicated in many diseases. The chief source of reactive oxygen species within the cell is the mitochondrion. We have characterized a variety of the biochemical and metabolic effects of inactivation of the mouse gene for the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (CD1-Sod2(tm1Cje)). The Sod2 mutant mice exhibit a tissue-specific inhibition of the respiratory chain enzymes NADH-dehydrogenase (complex I) and succinate dehydrogenase (complex II), inactivation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme aconitase, development of a urine organic aciduria in conjunction with a partial defect in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase, and accumulation of oxidative DNA damage. These results indicate that the increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species can result in biochemical aberrations with features reminiscent of mitochondrial myopathy, Friedreich ataxia, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Primary systemic carnitine deficiency (SCD; OMIM 212140) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, hypoglycaemia and hyperammonaemia. SCD has also been linked to sudden infant death syndrome. Membrane-physiological studies have suggested a defect of the carnitine transport system in the plasma membrane in SCD patients and in the mouse model, juvenile visceral steatosis. Although the responsible loci have been mapped in both human and mouse, the underlying gene has not yet been identified. Recently, we cloned and analysed the function of a novel transporter protein termed OCTN2. Our observation that OCTN2 has the ability to transport carnitine in a sodium-dependent manner prompted us to search for mutations in the gene encoding OCTN2, SLC22A5. Initially, we analysed the mouse gene and found a missense mutation in Slc22a5 in jvs mice. Biochemical analysis revealed that this mutation abrogates carnitine transport. Subsequent analysis of the human gene identified four mutations in three SCD pedigrees. Affected individuals in one family were homozygous for the deletion of a 113-bp region containing the start codon. In the second pedigree, the affected individual was shown to be a compound heterozygote for two mutations that cause a frameshift and a premature stop codon, respectively. In an affected individual belonging to a third family, we found a homozygous splice-site mutation also resulting in a premature stop codon. These mutations provide the first evidence that loss of OCTN2 function causes SCD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The mdx mouse, a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, carries a loss-of-function mutation in dystrophin, a component of the membrane-associated dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. Unlike humans, mdx mice rarely display cardiac abnormalities and exhibit dystrophic changes only in a small number of heavily used skeletal muscle groups. By contrast, mdx:MyoD-/-mice lacking dystrophin and the skeletal muscle-specific bHLH transcription factor MyoD display a severe skeletal myopathy leading to widespread dystrophic changes in skeletal muscle and premature death around 1 year of age. The severely increased phenotype of mdx:MyoD-/-muscle is a consequence of impaired muscle regeneration caused by enhanced satellite cell self-renewal. Here we report that mdx:MyoD-/-mice developed a severe cardiac myopathy with areas of necrosis associated with hypertrophied myocytes. Moreover, heart tissue from mdx:MyoD-/-mice exhibited constitutive activation of stress-activated signaling components, similar to in vitro models of cardiac myocyte adaptation. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that the progression of skeletal muscle damage is a significant contributing factor leading to development of cardiomyopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The severe infantile form of myotubular myopathy is a fatal muscle disease that predominantly affects male infants and is characterized by severe weakness and hypotonia from birth. X-linked myotubular myopathy was found to be associated with mutations in the MTM1 gene in Xq28 encoding the putative tyrosine phosphatase, myotubularin. We screened the MTM1 gene for mutations in seven Japanese patients (six males and one female) who had the diagnosis of severe infantile form of myotubular myopathy. We found five mutations, including three novel mutations based on sequence analysis of RT-PCR fragments covering the entire open reading frame. Two patients (one male and one female), who had similar clinicopathologic features, did not have any mutation in the MTM1 gene open reading frame, suggesting that they may have had an autosomal recessive disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>MTM1 is responsible for X-linked recessive myotubular myopathy, which is a congenital muscle disorder linked to Xq28. MTM1 is highly conserved from yeast to humans. A number of related genes also exist. The MTM1 gene family contains a consensus sequence consisting of the active enzyme site of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), suggesting that they belong to a new family of PTPs. Database searches revealed homology of myotubularin and all related peptides to the cisplatin resistance-associated alpha protein, which implicates an as yet unknown function. In addition, homology to the Sbf1 protein (SET binding factor 1), involved in the oncogenic transformation of fibroblasts and differentiation of myoblasts, was also evident. We describe 225 kb of genomic sequence containing MTM1 and the related gene, MTMR1, which lies 20 kb distal to MTM1. Although there is only moderate conservation of the exons, the striking similarity in the gene structures indicates that these two genes arose by duplication. Calculations suggest that this event occurred early in evolution long before separation of the human and mouse lineages. So far, mutations have been identified in the coding sequence of only 65% of the patients analyzed, indicating that the remaining mutations may lie in noncoding regions of MTM1 or possibly in MTMR1. Knowledge of the genomic sequence will facilitate mutation analyses of the coding and noncoding sequences of MTM1 and MTMR1.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A patient with progressive exercise intolerance, proximal weakness, and complex III deficiency in skeletal muscle had a missense mutation in the cytochrome b gene of mitochondrial DNA (G15762A). The mutation, which leads to the substitution of a highly conserved amino acid (G339E), was heteroplasmic (85%) in the patient's muscle and was not present in 100 individuals of different ethnic backgrounds. These data strongly suggest that this molecular defect is the primary cause of the myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>To gain insight into the function of type VI collagen, the col6a1 gene was inactivated by targeted gene disruption in the mouse. The homozygous mutants lacked collagen VI in the tissues and showed histological features of myopathy such as fiber necrosis and phagocytosis and a pronounced variation in the fiber diameter. Muscles also showed signs of stimulated regeneration of fibers. Necrotic fibers were particularly frequent in the diaphragm at all ages examined. Similar, although milder, alterations were detected in heterozygous mutant mice, indicating haploinsufficiency of the col6a1 gene function. The data led us to conclude that collagen VI is necessary for maintenance of the integrity of muscle fibers and that the col6a1 -deficient mouse can be considered an animal model of Bethlem myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The human dynactin 1 gene (DCTN1) is positioned on chromosome 2p13, the candidate region for various diseases including Alström syndrome, limb-girdle muscle dystrophy, and Miyoshi myopathy. Here, we report the exon-intron structure of DCTN1 along with characterization of the 5' upstream sequence and alternative splice variants previously identified by Tokito et al. (1996), Mol. Biol. Cell 7: 1167-1180). Knowledge of the genomic structure of DCTN1allowed us to design intronic primers necessary for analyzing mutations in families segregating for diseases linked to this gene. These primers were tested on a French Acadian kindred segregating for Alström syndrome. No mutations were observed within the coding region of DCTN1 in this family. However, the intronic primers should allow for the rapid amplification of the coding region for mutational analysis of additional Alström families and other diseases tightly linked to the DCTN1locus on chromosome 2p13.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked recessive myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a very severe congenital muscular disease characterised by an impaired maturation of muscle fibres, and caused by defects in the MTM1 gene. This gene defines a new family of putative tyrosine phosphatases conserved through evolution. We have determined intronic flanking sequences for all the 15 exons to facilitate the detection of mutations in patients and genetic counselling. We characterised a new polymorphic marker in the immediate vicinity of the gene, which might prove useful for linkage analysis. Sequencing of the TATA-less predicted promoter provides the basis for transcriptional regulatory studies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Human mitochondrial trifunctional protein (TFP) is a heterooctamer of four alpha- and four beta-subunits that catalyzes three steps in the beta-oxidation spiral of long-chain fatty acids. TFP deficiency causes a Reye-like syndrome, cardiomyopathy, or sudden, unexpected death. We delineated the molecular basis for TFP deficiency in two patients with a unique phenotype characterized by chronic progressive polyneuropathy and myopathy without hepatic or cardiac involvement. Single-stranded conformation variance and nucleotide sequencing identified all patient mutations in exon 9 of the alpha-subunit. One patient is homozygous for the T845A mutation that substitutes aspartic acid for valine at residue 246. The second patient is a compound heterozygote for the T914A that substitutes asparagine for isoleucine at residue 269 and a C871T that creates a premature termination at residue 255. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization studies revealed undetectable levels of the mRNA corresponding to the mutant allele carrying the termination codon. This study suggests a novel genotype-phenotype correlation in TFP deficiency; that is, mutations in exon 9 of the alpha-subunit, which encodes a linker domain between the NH2-terminal hydratase and the COOH-terminal 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, result in a unique neuromuscular phenotype.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a severe congenital muscle disorder due to mutations in the MTM1 gene. The corresponding protein, myotubularin, contains the consensus active site of tyrosine phosphatases (PTP) but otherwise shows no homology to other phosphatases. Myotubularin is able to hydrolyze a synthetic analogue of tyrosine phosphate, in a reaction inhibited by orthovanadate, and was recently shown to act on both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine. This gene is conserved down to yeast and strong homologies were found with human ESTs, thus defining a new dual specificity phosphatase (DSP) family. We report the presence of novel members of the MTM gene family in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis elegans, zebrafish, Drosophila, mouse and man. This represents the largest family of DSPs described to date. Eight MTM-related genes were found in the human genome and we determined the chromosomal localization and expression pattern for most of them. A subclass of the myotubularin homologues lacks a functional PTP active site. Missense mutations found in XLMTM patients affect residues conserved in a Drosophila homologue. Comparison of the various genes allowed construction of a phylogenetic tree and reveals conserved residues which may be essential for function. These genes may be good candidates for other genetic diseases.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mice lacking desmin produce muscle fibers with Z disks and normal sarcomeric organization. However, the muscles are mechanically fragile and degenerate upon repeated contractions. We report here a human patient with severe generalized myopathy and aberrant intrasarcoplasmic accumulation of desmin intermediate filaments. Muscle tissue from this patient lacks the wild-type desmin allele and has a desmin gene mutation encoding a 7-aa deletion within the coiled-coil segment of the protein. We show that recombinant desmin harboring this deletion cannot form proper desmin intermediate filament networks in cultured cells, nor is it able to assemble into 10-nm filaments in vitro. These findings provide direct evidence that a mutation in desmin can cause human myopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Desmin-related myopathies (DRM) are inherited neuromuscular disorders characterized by adult onset and delayed accumulation of aggregates of desmin, a protein belonging to the type III intermediate filament family, in the sarcoplasma of skeletal and cardiac muscles. In this paper, we have mapped the locus for DRM in a large French pedigree to a 26-cM interval in chromosome 11q21-23. This region contains the alphaB-crystallin gene (CRYAB), a candidate gene encoding a 20-kD protein that is abundant in lens and is also present in a number of non-ocular tissues, including cardiac and skeletal muscle. AlphaB-crystallin is a member of the small heat shock protein (shsp) family and possesses molecular chaperone activity. We identified an R120G missense mutation in CRYAB that co-segregates with the disease phenotype in this family. Muscle cell lines transfected with the mutant CRYAB cDNA showed intracellular aggregates that contain both desmin and alphaB-crystallin as observed in muscle fibers from DRM patients. These results are the first to identify a defect in a molecular chaperone as a cause for an inherited human muscle disorder.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Miyoshi myopathy (MM) is an adult onset, recessive inherited distal muscular dystrophy that we have mapped to human chromosome 2p13. We recently constructed a 3-Mb P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) contig spanning the MM candidate region. This clarified the order of genetic markers across the MM locus, provided five new polymorphic markers within it and narrowed the locus to approximately 2 Mb. Five skeletal muscle expressed sequence tags (ESTs) map in this region. We report that one of these is located in a novel, full-length 6.9-kb muscle cDNA, and we designate the corresponding protein 'dysferlin'. We describe nine mutations in the dysferlin gene in nine families; five are predicted to prevent dysferlin expression. Identical mutations in the dysferlin gene can produce more than one myopathy phenotype (MM, limb girdle dystrophy, distal myopathy with anterior tibial onset).</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Desmin-related myopathy (OMIM 601419) is a familial disorder characterized by skeletal muscle weakness associated with cardiac conduction blocks, arrhythmias and restrictive heart failure, and by intracytoplasmic accumulation of desmin-reactive deposits in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. The underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Involvement of the desmin gene (DES) has been excluded in three families diagnosed with desmin-related myopathy. We report two new families with desmin-related cardioskeletal myopathy associated with mutations in the highly conserved carboxy-terminal end of the desmin rod domain. A heterozygous A337P mutation was identified in a family with an adult-onset skeletal myopathy and mild cardiac involvement. Compound heterozygosity for two other mutations, A360P and N393I, was detected in a second family characterized by childhood-onset aggressive course of cardiac and skeletal myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Two siblings originating from Reunion Island were affected by a limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) type 2A and carried the same two mutations in the calpain gene: 946-1 AG-->AA, affecting a splice site, and S744G. They demonstrated the clinical variability possible with calpain-3 mutations. Onset was around 20 years of age in each of them. The girl's symptoms mimicked a metabolic myopathy, while her brother, at the same age, presented a classical phenotype of LGMD in an advanced functional stage.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The basal lamina of muscle fibers plays a crucial role in the development and function of skeletal muscle. An important laminin receptor in muscle is integrin alpha7beta1D. Integrin beta1 is expressed throughout the body, while integrin alpha7 is more muscle-specific. To address the role of integrin alpha7 in human muscle disease, we determined alpha7 protein expression in muscle biopsies from 117 patients with unclassified congenital myopathy and congenital muscular dystrophy by immunocytochemistry. We found three unrelated patients with integrin alpha7 deficiency and normal laminin alpha2 chain expression. To determine if any of these three patients had mutations of the integrin alpha7 gene, ITGA7, we cloned and sequenced the full-length human ITGA7 cDNA, and screened the patients for mutations. One patient had splice mutations on both alleles; one causing a 21-bp insertion in the conserved cysteine-rich region, and the other causing a 98-bp deletion. A second patient was a compound heterozygote for the same 98-bp deletion, and had a 1-bp frame-shift deletion on the other allele. A third showed marked deficiency of ITGA7 mRNA. Clinically, these patients showed congenital myopathy with delayed motor milestones. Our results demonstrate that mutations in ITGA7 are involved in a form of congenital myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Old mdx mice display a severe myopathy almost identical to Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. This study examined the contractile properties of old mdx muscles and investigated any effects of low-intensity exercise. Isometric contractile properties of the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles were tested in adult (8-10 mo) and old (24 mo, split into sedentary and exercised groups) mdx mice. The EDL and soleus from old mdx mice exhibited decreased absolute twitch and tetanic forces, and the soleus exhibited a > 50% decrease in relative forces (13.4 +/- 0.4 vs. 6.0 +/-0.9 N/cm2) compared with adult mice. Old mdx muscles also showed longer contraction times and a higher percentage of type I fibers. Normal and mdx mice completed 10 wk of swimming, but mdx mice spent significantly less time swimming than normal animals (7.8 +/- 0.4 vs. 15.8 +/-1.1 min, respectively). However, despite their severe dystrophy, mdx muscles responded positively to the low-intensity exercise. Relative tetanic tensions were increased (approximately 25% and approximately 45% for the EDL and soleus, respectively) after the swimming, although absolute forces were unaffected. Thus these results indicate that, even with a dystrophin-deficient myopathy, mdx muscles can still respond to low-intensity exercise. This study shows that the contractile function of muscles of old mdx mice displays many similarities to that of human dystrophic patients and provides further evidence that the use of non-weight-bearing, low-intensity exercises, such as swimming, has no detrimental effect on dystrophic muscle and could be a useful therapeutic aid for sufferers of muscular dystrophy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We report the cloning of the genomic and cDNA of the human 51 kDa subunit (NDUFV1) of mitochondrial complex I. The 6 kbp NDUFV1 gene is composed of 10 exons. All intron-exon boundaries comply to the consensus sequence for splice donor and acceptor sites. Within the 5' flanking region we identified a putative binding site for NRF-2, a GATA- and GC-box element. Canonical TATA- or CCAAT-boxes were absent, the transcriptional start site, however, lies within a CpG island, which is consistent with the "housekeeping" function of the gene. Within the coding sequence we detected consensus motifs for NADH, FMN, and iron-sulfur binding sites. The amino acid sequence homology between human and cow is 96.9%. Surprisingly we found a 48 bp long complete antisense homology between the 3'UTR of the NDUFV1-mRNA and the 5'UTR of the mRNA for the gamma-interferon inducible protein precursor (IP-30). This finding is intriguing since both genes lie on different chromosomes. The exact function of IP-30 is not yet known, but it may play a role in gamma-interferon mediated immune reactions. The NDUFV1-mRNA might act as an antisense suppresser, thus restraining translation of IP-30 in tissues with high energy demand. This finding could be a molecular link between complex I deficiency and inflammatory myopathy which have been repeatedly described to occur together.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical, serologic, and immunogenetic features of familial idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) and to compare these with the features of sporadic IIM. METHODS: Clinical signs and symptoms, autoantibodies, HLA-DRB1 and DQA1 alleles, and GM/KM phenotypes were compared among 36 affected and 28 unaffected members of 16 unrelated families in which 2 or more blood relatives developed an IIM. In addition, findings in patients with familial IIM were compared with those in 181 patients with sporadic IIM. The families included 3 pairs of monozygotic twins with juvenile dermatomyositis, 11 families with other siblings or relatives with polymyositis or dermatomyositis, and 2 families with inclusion body myositis. RESULTS: The clinical features of familial IIM were similar to those of sporadic IIM, although the frequency of myositis-specific autoantibodies was lower in familial than in sporadic IIM. DRB1*0301 was a common genetic risk factor for familial and sporadic IIM, but contributed less to the genetic risk of familial IIM (etiologic fraction 0.35 versus 0.51 in sporadic IIM). Homozygosity at the HLA-DQA1 locus was found to be a genetic risk factor unique to familial IIM (57% versus 24% of controls; odds ratio 4.2, corrected P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: These findings emphasize that 1) familial muscle weakness is not always due to inherited metabolic defects or dystrophies, but may be the result of the development of IIM in several members of the same family, and 2) multiple genetic factors are likely important in the etiology and disease expression of familial IIM, as is also the case for sporadic myositis, but DQA1 homozygosity is a distinct risk factor for familial IIM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome (SCCMS) is caused by gain of function mutations in subunits of the end-plate acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The mutations prolong the opening episodes of the AChR channel, leading to a depolarization block and an end-plate myopathy. Because levels of quinidine sulfate attainable in clinical practice shorten the opening episodes of genetically engineered mutant SCCMS receptors in vitro, we tested the notion that the drug can be of benefit in SCCMS. We treated 6 SCCMS patients with quinidine sulfate in an open-label trial, using objective clinical measures of muscle strength and repetitive stimulation studies as end points. One patient became allergic to quinidine after 7 days. The remaining patients tolerated the drug well and after 30 days of continuous therapy showed statistically significant improvement in muscle strength and in decrement of the compound muscle action potential elicited by rapid rates of stimulation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Several proteins that contribute to epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation contain a characteristic motif of unknown function called the SET (Suvar3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste, Trithorax) domain. We have demonstrated that SET domains mediate highly conserved interactions with a specific family of proteins that display similarity with dual-specificity phosphatases (dsPTPases). These include myotubularin, the gene of which is mutated in a subset of patients with X-linked myotubular myopathy, and Sbf1, a newly isolated homologue of myotubularin. In contrast with myotubularin, Sbf1 lacks a functional catalytic domain which dephosphorylates phospho-tyrosine and serine-containing peptides in vitro. Competitive interference of endogenous SET domain-dsPTPase interactions by forced expression of Sbf1 induced oncogenic transformation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and impaired the in vitro differentiation of C2 myoblast cells. We conclude that myotubularin-type phosphatases link SET-domain containing components of the epigenetic regulatory machinery with signalling pathways involved in growth and differentiation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The Bethlem myopathy is a rare autosomal dominant proximal myopathy characterized by early childhood onset and joint contractures. Evidence for linkage and genetic heterogeneity has been established, with the majority of families linked to 21q22.3 and one large family linked to 2q37, implicating the three type VI collagen subunit genes, COL6A1 (chromosome 21), COL6A2 (chromosome 21) and COL6A3 (chromosome 2) as candidate genes. Mutations of the invariant glycine residues in the triple-helical domain-coding region of COL6A1 and COL6A2 have been reported previously in the chromosome 21-linked families. We report here the identification of a G-->A mutation in the N-terminal globular domain-coding region of COL6A3 in a large American pedigree (19 affected, 12 unaffected), leading to the substitution of glycine by glutamic acid in the N2 motif, which is homologous to the type A domains of the von Willebrand factor. This mutation segregated to all affected family members, to no unaffected family members, and was not identified in 338 unrelated Caucasian control chromosomes. Thus mutations in either the triple-helical domain or the globular domain of type VI collagen appear to cause Bethlem myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal muscle that is triggered in genetically predisposed individuals by common anesthetics and muscle relaxants. The ryanodine receptor (RYR1) is mutated in a number of MH pedigrees, some members of which also have central core disease (CCD), an inherited myopathy closely associated with MH. Mutation screening of 6 kb of the RYR1 gene has identified four adjacent novel mutations, C6487T, G6488A, G6502A, and C6617T, which result in the amino acid alterations Arg2163Cys, Arg2163His, Val2168Met, and Thr2206Met, respectively. Collectively, these mutations account for 11% of MH cases and identify the gene segment 6400-6700 as a mutation hot spot. Correlation analysis of the in vitro contracture-test data available for pedigrees bearing these and other RYR1 mutations showed an exceptionally good correlation between caffeine threshold and tension values, whereas no correlation was observed between halothane threshold and tension values. This finding has important ramifications for assignment of the MH-susceptible phenotype, in genotyping studies, and indicates that assessment of recombinant individuals on the basis of caffeine response is justified, whereas assessment on the basis of halothane response may be problematic. Interestingly, the data suggest a link between the caffeine threshold and tension values and the MH/CCD phenotype.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hyperglycemia can upregulate protein kinase C (PKC), which may be an important mediator of the progression from normal heart and muscle function to diabetic myopathy in the myocardium and skeletal muscle in type 1 insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDM). We evaluated this possibility during the early stage of IDM in BB/Wor diabetic (D) rats and age-matched BB/Wor diabetes-resistant (DR) rats. Interventricular septal thickness, E wave peak velocity of tricuspid inflow (both minimum and maximum), and left ventricular (LV) weight index were increased, and the rate of change in LV pressure (LV dP/dt) decreased in D rats subjected to M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography and hemodynamic recording of heart rate, LV pressure (LVP), + LV dP/dt, -LV dP/dt, and LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) in vivo and in vitro 41 days after the onset of hyperglycemia. Whole ventricle basal PKC activity was increased by 44.4 and 18.4% in the particulate and soluble fractions, respectively, from D rats compared with that from DR rats using r-32P phosphorylation of appropriate peptide substrates. When measured by Western blot gel densitometry, particulate PKC-alpha and PKC-delta content increased by 89 and 24%, respectively, but soluble PKC-beta and soluble and particulate PKC-epsilon were unchanged compared with that of DR rats. Similarly, gracilis muscle PKC activity and PKC-alpha and PKC-delta were elevated in the gracilis muscle, whereas that of the circulating neutrophil did not differ between the D and DR rats. Thus, in vivo, the early diabetic cardiomyopathy of the D rat is characterized by a restrictive LV with increased septal thickness and is associated with elevated PKC activity and increased amounts of myocardial particulate PKC-alpha and PKC-delta, which are also seen in the skeletal muscle. We conclude that increased PKC isozymes may play a pivotal role during IDM in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The alpha7beta1 integrin is the primary laminin receptor on skeletal myoblasts and adult myofibers. It has distinct functions during muscle development and contributes to muscle structural integrity. We have studied this integrin in cases where expression of dystrophin or laminin are compromised. Immunofluorescence demonstrates an increase in alpha7beta1 in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy and in mdx mice that lack dystrophin. Analysis of RNA from mdx mice and from patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies indicates that the increase in the alpha7beta1 integrin is regulated at the level of alpha7 gene transcription. In contrast, the levels of alpha7beta1 integrin are severely diminished in patients with laminin alpha2 chain congenital dystrophy muscular dystrophy and in dy/dy mice that also do not make the alpha2 laminin chain. Analysis of RNA from the hindlimbs of dy/dy mice demonstrated that in the absence of laminin alpha7 gene transcription is inhibited and limited to specific alternatively spliced isoforms. We suggest that the increased expression of alpha7beta1 integrin in the absence of dystrophin compensates for the reduced dystrophin-mediated linkage of fibers with the basal lamina and modulates the development of pathology associated with these diseases. The decrease in alpha7beta1 integrin and its transcripts in the absence of laminin likely contributes to the severe myopathy that results from laminin alpha2 chain deficiency and suggests that laminin-2 regulates expression of the alpha7 integrin gene. The role of the alpha7beta1 integrin in muscle integrity also suggests that compromised expression of this receptor may underlie as yet undefined myopathies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We studied the capillaries and myocytes of masseter and cardiac muscles of diabetic KK-Ay mice, using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The following changes were observed for diabetic masseters: capillary tortuosity, diversity of capillary caliber, endothelial cell swelling accompanied by luminal narrowing, widening of the pericapillary space and pericapillary fibrosis, and subsarcolemmal accumulation of myocytic mitochondria in areas adjacent to capillaries. In addition, attenuated capillary segments were largely covered by pericytes with profuse processes. In contrast, cardiac muscles of KK-Ay mice exhibited subsarcolemmal accumulation of myocytic mitochondria in areas contiguous to capillaries, and degenerative changes of myocytes such as disarrangement of myofilaments, disappearance of Z-bands and clustering of lipid-like vacuoles, although conspicuous changes of capillaries were not noted. Microvascular and myocytic changes described above may suggest the presence of microangiopathy and myopathy in the masseter and heart of KK-Ay mice.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Loss-of-function mutations in the G4.5 gene have been shown to cause Barth syndrome (BTHS), an X-linked disorder characterized by cardiac and skeletal myopathy, short stature, and neutropenia. We recently reported a family with a severe X-linked cardiomyopathy described as isolated noncompaction of the left ventricular myocardium (INVM). Other findings associated with BTHS (skeletal myopathy, neutropenia, growth retardation, elevated urinary organic acids, and mitochondrial abnormalities) were either absent or inconsistent. A linkage study of the X chromosome localized INVM to the Xq28 region near the BTHS locus, suggesting that these disorders are allelic. We screened the G4.5 gene for mutations in this family with SSCP and direct sequencing and found a novel glycine-to-arginine substitution at position 197. This position is conserved in a homologous Caenorhabditis elegans protein. We conclude that INVM is a severe allelic variant of BTHS with a specific effect on the heart. This finding provides further structure-function information about the G4.5 gene product and has implications for unexplained cases of severe infantile hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in males.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Barth syndrome (BTHS) is an X-linked disorder characterized clinically by the associated features of cardiac and skeletal myopathy, short stature, and neutropenia. The clinical manifestations of the disease are, in general, quite variable, but cardiac failure as a consequence of cardiac dilatation and hypertrophy is a constant finding and is the most common cause of death in the first months of life. X-linked cardiomyopathies with clinical manifestations similar to BTHS have been reported, and it has been proposed that they may be allelic. We have recently identified the gene responsible for BTHS, in one of the Xq28 genes, G4.5. In this paper we report the sequence analysis of 11 additional familial cases: 8 were diagnosed as possibly affected with BTHS, and 3 were affected with X-linked dilated cardiomyopathies. Mutations in the G4.5 gene were found in nine of the patients analyzed. The molecular studies have linked together what were formerly considered different conditions and have shown that the G4.5 gene is responsible for BTHS (OMIM 302060), X-linked endocardial fibroelastosis (OMIM 305300), and severe X-linked cardiomyopathy (OMIM 300069). Our results also suggest that very severe phenotypes may be associated with null mutations in the gene, whereas mutations in alternative portions or missense mutations may give a "less severe" phenotype.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked recessive myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is characterized by severe hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness, with impaired maturation of muscle fibres. The gene responsible, MTM1, was identified recently by positional cloning, and encodes a protein (myotubularin) with a tyrosine phosphatase domain (PTP). Myotubularin is highly conserved through evolution and defines a new family of putative tyrosine phosphatases in man. We report the identification of MTM1 mutations in 55 of 85 independent patients screened by single-strand conformation polymorphism for all the coding sequence. Large deletions were observed in only three patients. Five point mutations were found in multiple unrelated patients, accounting for 27% of the observed mutations. The possibility of detecting mutations and determining carrier status in a disease with a high proportion of sporadic cases is of importance for genetic counselling. More than half of XLMTM mutations are expected to inactivate the putative enzymatic activity of myotubularin, either by truncation or by missense mutations affecting the predicted PTP domain. Additional mutations are missenses clustered in two regions of the protein. Most of these affect amino acids conserved in the homologous yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans proteins, thus indicating the presence of other functional domains.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The relationship between the inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis and occurrence of myopathy was studied in L6 myoblasts using two lines of cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (simvastatin) and squalene epoxidase inhibitors (TU-2078 and NB-598). All inhibitors completely inhibited the cholesterol synthesis in L6 myoblasts at doses of 1 and 3 microM. Simvastatin (3 microM) inhibited the fusion reaction of L6 myoblasts followed by the severe cellular damage. The myoblasts also had failed actin fiber formation and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) production. Additionally, this agent also caused apoptotic cell death in differentiated L6 muscle fiber, indicating that skeletal myopathy by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors seems to occur not only in differentiating immature myoblasts but also in matured skeletal myotubes. In contrast, TU-2078 and NB-598 had no effect on the fusion reaction of differentiating myoblasts or on the cellular viability of muscle fiber at 3 microM, enough to completely inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis. It is conceivable that the mevalonate depletion and subsequent failure of ras farnesylation induced by simvastatin might cause the defects in differentiation and maintenance of the muscle fiber. Squalene epoxidase inhibitors did not show this adverse effect presumably because of the enzyme inhibition downstream of farnesyl synthesis. The present findings suggest the safe use of squalene epoxidase inhibitors in lipid-lowering therapy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A candidate gene, myotubularin, involved in the pathogenesis of X-linked myotubular myopathy (MTM1) was isolated recently. Mutations originally were identified in 12% of patients examined for 40% of the coding sequence, raising the possibility that additional genes could be responsible for a proportion of X-linked cases. We report here the identification of mutations in 26 of 41 independent male patients with muscle biopsy-proven MTM, by direct genomic sequencing of 92% of the known coding sequence of the myotubularin gene. Eighteen patients had point mutations, including one A/G transition found in four patients which alters a splice acceptor site in exon 12 and leads to a three amino acid insertion. Six patients had small deletions involving &lt;6 bp, while two larger deletions encompassed two or six exons, respectively. No differences were noted among the types of mutations between familial and sporadic cases. However, all of the five patients with a mild phenotype had missense mutations. While 50% of the mutations were found in exons 4 and 12, and three distinct mutations were found in more than one patient, no single mutation accounted for more than 10% of the cases. The low frequency of large deletions and the varied mutations identified suggest that direct mutation screening for molecular diagnosis may require gene sequencing.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A null mutation in the desmin gene has been introduced into the germ line of mice. Such mice develop and reproduce normally proving that desmin is not needed either for the formation of the heart or the alignment of functioning myofibrils. However, cardiovascular lesions and a skeletal myopathy were observed in growing and adult mice. In the present study we have carried out a detailed analysis of these cardiac lesions. Homozygous mutant mice, which were confirmed to lack expression of desmin mRNA and desmin protein in the heart, were revealed by electron microscopy to contain degenerating cardiomyocytes as early as 5 days post-partum. At 10 days post-partum and onwards the degeneration of cardiomyocytes gave rise to areas with an accumulation of macrophages, fibrosis and calcification preferentially in the inter-ventricular septum and the free wall of the right ventricle. The localization of the lesions mainly to these sites suggested that it is not the work load and contractions per se which were the pathogenic events leading to the cardiomyopathy. It might be that stress related to lengthening of the myocytes occur more in the right ventricle than in the left. At the ultrastructural level changes in the intercalated discs, disruption of the sarcolemma and supercontraction of myofibrils seemed to be the key events leading to cardiomyocyte death. Thus, the intermediate filaments are required to maintain the basic integrity of cardiomyocytes and especially the link between the intermediate filaments and the sarcolemma appear more important than previously realized.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>McArdle's disease is an autosomal recessive myopathy with symptoms of exercise intolerance caused by deficiency of the enzyme muscle glycogen phosphorylase which releases glucose for contraction during exercise. The human cDNA has been sequenced and disease-causing mutations identified. An ovine equivalent of McArdle's disease has been diagnosed and the mutation responsible identified by PCR-amplification of the ovine glycogen myophosphorylase cDNA in six overlapping fragments followed by single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Two fragments showed SSCPs in the glycogen myophosphorylase cDNA from affected sheep. The SSCP in fragment one was a silent polymorphism, while that in fragment six, was an eight base deletion at the 5' end of exon 20. This deletion will cause a frame-shift, a premature stop codon and remove the last 31 amino-acid residues from the protein. The cDNA deletion suggested that the genomic mutation most likely involved a splice-site. Sequencing intron 19 identified the mutation as an adenine for guanine substitution at the intron 19 3' splice-site. This eliminated an XbaI site present in normal sheep allowing diagnosis of normal, affected and carrier sheep. This ovine model of McArdle's disease is now available for therapeutic trials.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mitochondrial trifunctional protein (TP), an enzyme of beta-oxidation, is a multienzyme complex composed of four molecules of the alpha-subunit (HADHA) containing the enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase domains and four molecules of the beta-subunit (HADHB) containing the 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase domain. An inborn error of this enzyme complex can cause sudden infant death syndrome, acute hepatic encephalopathy or liver failure, skeletal myopathy, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. TP deficiency is classified into two different biochemical phenotypes: one represents the existence of both subunits and the lack of only the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity and the other represents the absence of both subunits and the lack of all three TP activities, although their clinical features are similar. We have identified two Japanese patients with this disorder. Three enzyme activities of TP were undetectable in fibroblasts from these two patients. We detected two mutations in the HADHB gene from two Japanese patients, an exonic single T insertion which created a new cryptic 5' splice site and a G1331A transition (R411 K). Patient 1 was a compound heterozygote, while patient 2 was a homozygote of a G1331A transition.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We describe a novel genetic and kinetic defect in a slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome. The severely disabled propositus has advanced endplate myopathy, prolonged and biexponentially decaying endplate currents, and prolonged acetylcholine receptor (AChR) channel openings. Genetic analysis reveals the heterozygous mutation alphaV249F in the propositus and mosaicism for alphaV249F in the asymptomatic father. Unlike mutations described previously in the M2 transmembrane domain, alphaV249F is located N-terminal to the conserved leucines and is not predicted to face the channel lumen. Expression of the alphaV249F AChR in HEK fibroblasts demonstrates increased channel openings in the absence of ACh, prolonged openings in its presence, enhanced steady-state desensitization, and nanomolar rather than micromolar affinity of one of the two binding sites in the resting activatable state. Thus, neuromuscular transmission is compromised because cationic overloading leads to degenerating junctional folds and loss of AChR, because an increased fraction of AChR is desensitized in the resting state, and because physiological rates of stimulation elicit additional desensitization and depolarization block of transmission.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In an attempt to create an animal model of tissue-specific mitochondrial disease, we generated 'knockout' mice deficient in the heart/muscle isoform of the adenine nucleotide translocator (Ant1). Histological and ultrastructural examination of skeletal muscle from Ant1 null mutants revealed ragged-red muscle fibers and a dramatic proliferation of mitochondria, while examination of the heart revealed cardiac hypertrophy with mitochondrial proliferation. Mitochondria isolated from mutant skeletal muscle exhibited a severe defect in coupled respiration. Ant1 mutant adults also had a resting serum lactate level fourfold higher than that of controls, indicative of metabolic acidosis. Significantly, mutant adults manifested severe exercise intolerance. Therefore, Ant1 mutant mice have the biochemical, histological, metabolic and physiological characteristics of mitochondrial myopathy and cardiomyopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We have identified a novel human gene that is entirely deleted in two boys with abnormal genital development and myotubular myopathy (MTM1). The gene, F18, is located in proximal Xq28, approximately 80 kb centromeric to the recently isolated MTM1 gene. Northern analysis of mRNA showed a ubiquitous pattern and suggested high levels of expression in skeletal muscle, brain, and heart. A transcript of 4.6 kb was detected in a range of tissues, and additional alternate forms of 3.8 and 2.6 kb were present in placenta and pancreas, respectively. The gene extends over 100 kb and is composed of at least seven exons, of which two are noncoding. Sequence analysis of a 4.6-kb cDNA contig revealed two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) that encode putative proteins of 701 and 424 amino acids, respectively. Two alternative spliced transcripts affecting the large open reading frame were identified that, together with the Northern blot results, suggest that distinct proteins are derived from the gene. No significant homology to other known proteins was detected, but segments of the first ORF encode polyglutamine tracts and proline-rich domains, which are frequently observed in DNA-binding proteins. The F18 gene is a strong candidate for being implicated in the intersexual genitalia present in the two MTM1-deleted patients. The gene also serves as a candidate for other disorders that map to proximal Xq28.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>This study demonstrates that the cause of calmitine deficiency in dy/dy dystrophic mice and patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the same; i.e., the absence of an inhibitor of calmitine-specific mitochondrial protease. This inhibitor, which is present in control mice and control subjects, prevented degradation of the protein. It is also shown that a drug (IP96) was capable in vitro of inhibiting calmitine-specific mitochondrial protease from muscle of DMD patients and dy/dy mice. This drug was also active in vivo in an experimental model of myopathy created in the normal mouse by a single injection of chlorpromazine, a myotoxic drug, which induced temporary calmitine degradation. Thus, it seems quite likely that IP96 prevents calmitine degradation by inhibiting the specific protease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a potentially fatal, often autosomal dominant, disorder of skeletal muscle and is triggered in susceptible people by all commonly used inhalational anesthetics. In this article, the authors describe a malignant hyperthermia susceptible (MHS) kindred in which both parents of the proband are MHS and are first-degree cousins. Haplotype analysis in this kindred with chromosome 19 linked markers revealed that the proband and another sibling were homozygous for the affected RYR1 allele. METHODS: Eighteen members of this large pedigree were investigated, with a clinical examination for signs of a myopathy, a caffeine halothane contracture test, a histo-enzymologic study on the muscle biopsies, and linkage analysis on genomic DNA isolated from family blood samples. RYR1 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and was cloned and sequenced, facilitating mutation detection. RESULTS: Linkage analysis demonstrated linkage between RYR1-linked markers and MH susceptibility in this family. DNA sequencing identified a T to C transition at nucleotide position 103, resulting in the substitution of an arginine for cysteine 35, representing the most N-terminal mutation reported to date in the RYR1 gene. This mutation segregates fully with the MHS trait, generating a lod score of 4.65 in favor of linkage to MHS at a recombination frequency of 0.0. CONCLUSIONS: The proband in this kindred is the first reported homozygote to have presented with an MH episode. The homozygotes in this pedigree do not have an overt myopathy. The sensitivity of muscle samples to caffeine clearly distinguished the two homozygotes from other heterozygous-susceptible individuals. No clear differentiation was observed with the halothane contracture results.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>BACKGROUND: Some patients with autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy have mutations in the genes coding for the sarcoglycan proteins (alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-sarcoglycan). To determine the frequency of sarcoglycan-gene mutations and the relation between the clinical features and genotype, we studied several hundred patients with myopathy. METHODS: Antibody against alpha-sarcoglycan was used to stain muscle-biopsy specimens from 556 patients with myopathy and normal dystrophin genes (the gene frequently deleted in X-linked muscular dystrophy). Patients whose biopsy specimens showed a deficiency of alpha-sarcoglycan on immunostaining were studied for mutations of the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-sarcoglycan genes with reverse transcription of muscle RNA, analysis involving single-strand conformation polymorphisms, and sequencing. RESULTS: Levels of alpha-sarcoglycan were found to be decreased on immunostaining of muscle-biopsy specimens from 54 of the 556 patients (10 percent); in 25 of these patients no alpha-sarcoglycan was detected. Screening for sarcoglycan-gene mutations in 50 of the 54 patients revealed mutations in 29 patients (58 percent): 17 (34 percent) had mutations in the alpha-sarcoglycan gene, 8 (16 percent) in the beta-sarcoglycan gene, and 4 (8 percent) in the gamma-sarcoglycan gene. No mutations were found in 21 patients (42 percent). The prevalence of sarcoglycan-gene mutations was highest among patients with severe (Duchenne-like) muscular dystrophy that began in childhood (18 of 83 patients, or 22 percent); the prevalence among patients with proximal (limb-girdle) muscular dystrophy with a later onset was 6 percent (11 of 180 patients). CONCLUSIONS: Defects in the genes coding for the sarcoglycan proteins are limited to patients with Duchenne-like and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy with normal dystrophin and occur in 11 percent of such patients.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We have isolated a cDNA from human foetal brain cDNA library which encodes a putative transmembrane protein bearing an intracellular protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) like domain. The PTPase like domain contains an alanine to aspartate amino acid change relative to other PTPases in the catalytic core domain. This amino acid change is found in only three other known proteins, islet cell autoantigens; human, murine and rat IA-2, murine IA-2b and its rat orthologue phogrin, which have a similar overall structure to ICAAR, and the recently identified X-linked myotubular myopathy (MTM1) gene. ICAAR, IA-2 and IA-2b clearly represent a new family of PTP-like proteins for which catalytic activity has yet to be demonstrated. An abundant ICAAR mRNA is detectable in the brain and pancreas but not in the other normal human tissues surveyed. We have localised ICAAR to human chromosome 7q36.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The differential display method was applied to identify gene expression which is especially up-regulated in the rat denervated skeletal muscle. Total RNA from normal and denervated facial muscles was isolated, amplified by PCR using certain primers, and separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel. PCR products which were apparently higher in the operated than in the control side were cut out from the gel and subsequently sequenced. One of the cDNA fragments obtained in the present study showed about 80% identity in nucleotide sequence and about 84% identity in amino acid sequence to one of the NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) subunits from the bovine heart mitochondria (813). Complex I, the first and largest enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone-10 (UQ-10). B13 is a 13 kDa subunit; deficiency of which causes incomplete or incorrect assembly of a functional complex I, resulting in one of the types of human mitochondrial myopathy. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization histochemistry confirmed that rat B13 mRNA expression was up-regulated after denervation and was distributed throughout whole muscle cell body. These findings suggest that up-regulation of the rat B13 mRNA expression after denervation plays an important role in the effective electron transfer from NADH to UQ-10 in skeletal muscle cells, resulting in restriction of lipid peroxidation and biological tissue damage.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in genes encoding the epsilon, delta, beta and alpha subunits of the end plate acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (AChR) are described and functionally characterized in three slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndrome patients. All three had prolonged end plate currents and AChR channel opening episodes and an end plate myopathy with loss of AChR from degenerating junctional folds. Genetic analysis revealed heterozygous mutations: epsilon L269F and delta Q267E in Patient 1, beta V266M in Patient 2, and alpha N217K in Patient 3 that were not detected in 100 normal controls. Patients 1 and 2 have no similarly affected relatives; in Patient 3, the mutation cosegregates with the disease in three generations. epsilon L269F, delta Q267E and beta V266M occur in the second and alpha N217K in the first transmembrane domain of AChR subunits; all have been postulated to contribute to the lining of the upper half of the channel lumen and all but delta Q267E are positioned toward the channel lumen, and introduce an enlarged side chain. Expression studies in HEK cells indicate that all of the mutations express normal amounts of AChR. epsilon L269F, beta V266M, and alpha N217K slow the rate of channel closure in the presence of ACh and increase apparent affinity for ACh; epsilon L269F and alpha N217K enhance desensitization, and epsilon L269F and beta V266M cause pathologic channel openings in the absence of ACh, rendering the channel leaky, delta Q267E has none of these effects and is therefore a rare polymorphism or a benign mutation. The end plate myopathy stems from cationic overloading of the postsynaptic region. The safety margin of neuromuscular transmission is compromised by AChR loss from the junctional folds and by a depolarization block owing to temporal summation of prolonged end plate potentials at physiologic rates of stimulation.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Genetic defects of myophosphorylase in humans cause a metabolic myopathy (McArdle's disease) characterized by exercise intolerance, cramps, and recurrent myoglobinuria. Recently, a breed of cattle with myophosphorylase deficiency has been identified: this is the first animal model of McArdle's disease. To define the molecular genetic error in the cattle, we cloned and sequenced the wild-type bovine myophosphorylase cDNA. Homology to human cDNA is 95.8% for the amino acid sequence, and 92.0% for the nucleotide sequence. Sequence homology to rabbit cDNA is 97.3% in amino acid, 90.8% in nucleotide. In the cDNA fragments amplified by RT-PCR from muscle RNA of the cattle with myophosphorylase deficiency, we identified a C-to-T substitution, changing an encoded arginine (CGG) to tryptophan (TGG) at codon 489. The mutant residue is adjacent to pyridoxal phosphate binding sites and to an active site residue, and the sequence around this mutation is highly conserved in different species.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Desmin is a muscle-specific intermediate filament that is encoded by a gene assigned to human chromosome 2q35. Desmin-related myopathies are inherited disorders characterized by an intrasarcoplasmic accumulation of desmin. Recently, the knockout of the desmin gene was shown to generate a myopathic syndrome in transgenic mice, suggesting that functional abnormality of desmin may generate similar clinical symptoms in mouse and human. To determine the potential role of the desmin gene in a well-defined desmin-related myopathy (autosomal dominant form of Fardeau), human desmin cDNAs obtained from affected and unaffected individuals were cloned, sequenced and compared. No obvious mutation was detected. A BssHII restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) was identified in exon 6 of the desmin gene. This RFLP was associated with a previously identified EcoRV RFLP in exon 4 to generate a tetra-allelic system, which was tested for linkage to the desmin-related myopathy in three families. The human desmin gene was localized within an 11-cM interval on chromosome 2q using a panel of radiation hybrids. This 11-cM region was clearly excluded by linkage analysis in the three desmin-related myopathy families using a set of highly polymorphic microsatellite markers. These results suggest that the desmin gene is not primarily involved in this disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>We have recently described a female patient with myotubular myopathy (MTM1) and an interstitial deletion at Xq28. Characterisation of the deletion allowed us to position the MTM1 gene to a 600 kb region between DXS304 and DXS497. In order to further restrict the region we screened for deletions in a set of 38 patients. We found two overlapping deletions in boys that in addition to MTM1 showed an unexpected abnormal genital development. As the latter phenotype is not found in the other non-deleted MTM1 patients, our observations are best explained by a contiguous gene syndrome. The deletions define a 430 kb region that contains the MTM1 gene and most likely a gene implicated in male sexual development. A high resolution physical map of this region is presented.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Among the diverse family of collagens, the widely expressed microfibrillar type VI collagen is believed to play a role in bridging cells with the extracellular matrix. Several observations imply substrate properties for cell attachment as well as association with major collagen fibers. Previously, we have established genetic linkage between the genes encoding the three constituent alpha-chains of type VI collagen and Bethlem myopathy. A distinctive feature of this autosomal dominant disorder consists of contractures of multiple joints in addition to generalized muscular weakness and wasting. Nine kindreds show genetic linkage to the COL6A1-COL6A2 cluster on chromosome 21q22.3 (refs 3,4; manuscript submitted) whereas one family shows linkage to markers on chromosome 2q37 close to COL6A3 (ref. 5). Sequence analysis in four families reveals a mutation in COL6A1 in one and a COL6A2 mutation in two other kindreds. Both mutations disrupt the Gly-X-Y motif of the triple helical domain by substitution of Gly for either Val or Ser. Analogous to the putative perturbation of the anchoring function of the dystrophin-associated complex in congenital muscular dystrophy with mutations in the alpha 2-subunit of laminin, our observations suggest a similar mechanism in Bethlem myopathy.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Transgenic mice overexpressing approximately eightfold the mouse (Mo) prion protein (PrP) gene carrying the P102L mutation of GSS developed neurodegeneration between 150 and 300 days of age, while controls expressing the wild-type MoPrP-A transgene at the same level remained healthy. Mice overexpressing the wild-type MoPrP-A transgene were highly susceptible to inoculated mouse prions, exhibiting abbreviated scrapie incubation times of 45 days. After crossing the mutant transgene onto a null (Prnp 0/0) background, the resulting Tg(MoPrP-P101L)Prnp 0/0 mice displayed a highly synchronous onset of illness at 145 days of age, which was shortened to 85 days upon breeding to homozygosity for the transgene array. Besides occasional PrP plaques and modest spongiform degeneration, Tg(MoPrP-P101L) mice suffered from a myopathy and a peripheral neuropathy. Disruption of the wild-type MoPrP gene increased the number of PrP plaques and the severity of spongiform degeneration. Brain extracts prepared from spontaneously ill transgenic mice transmitted disease to Tg196/Prnp 0/0 mice, expressing low levels of the mutant transgene. Our results demonstrate that the presence of wild-type PrP genes, the level of PrP transgene expression, and the sequence of the transgene can profoundly modify experimental prion disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Plectin is a widely expressed high molecular weight protein that is involved in cytoskeleton-membrane attachment in epithelial cells, muscle, and other tissues. The human autosomal recessive disorder epidermolysis bullosa with muscular dystrophy (MD-EBS) shows epidermal blister formation at the level of the hemidesmosome and is associated with a myopathy of unknown etiology. Here, plectin was found to be absent in skin and cultured keratinocytes from an MD-EBS patient by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, suggesting that plectin is a candidate gene/protein system for MD-EBS mutation. The 14800-bp human plectin cDNA was cloned and sequenced. The predicted 518-kD polypeptide has homology to the actin-binding domain of the dystrophin family at the amino terminus, a central rod domain, and homology to the intermediate filament-associated protein desmoplakin at the carboxyl terminus. The corresponding human gene (PLEC1), consisting of 33 exons spanning >26 kb of genomic DNA was cloned, sequenced, and mapped to chromosomal band 8q24. Homozygosity by descent was observed in the consanguineous MD-EBS family with intragenic plectin polymorphisms. Direct sequencing of PCR-amplified plectin cDNA from the patient's keratinocytes revealed a homozygous 8-bp deletion in exon 32 causing a frameshift and a premature termination codon 42 bp downstream. The clinically unaffected parents of the proband were found to be heterozygous carriers of the mutation. These results establish the molecular basis of MD-EBS in this family and clearly demonstrate the important structural role for plectin in cytoskeleton-membrane adherence in both skin and muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The gene for X-linked myotubular myopathy (MTM1) has been localized to a 300-kb critical region in human Xq28 between IDS and GABRA3. As part of an effort to clone this gene, we developed a YAC contig on the mouse X Chromosome (Chr) which includes loci homologous to those within the human MTM1 critical region. The murine contig consists of 18 YACs and spans 2.5-3.0 Mb. We have aligned the human and murine physical maps by isolating conserved mouse genomic fragments, including CpG islands and trapped exons. We believe that the simultaneous isolation of genes from both mouse and human and continued comparative mapping will prove helpful in the eventual identification of MTM1 and other genes in the region.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>To investigate the function of MyoD in adult skeletal muscle, we interbred MyoD mutant mice with mdx mice, a model for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. Mice lacking both MyoD and dystrophin displayed a marked increase in severity of myopathy leading to premature death, suggesting a role for MyoD in muscle regeneration. Examination of MyoD mutant muscle revealed elevated numbers of myogenic cells; however, myoblasts derived from these cells displayed normal differentiation potential in vitro. Following injury, MyoD mutant muscle was severely deficient in regenerative ability, and we observed a striking reduction in the in vivo proliferation of myogenic cells during regeneration. Therefore, we propose that the failure of MyoD-deficient muscle to regenerate efficiently is not caused by a reduction in numbers of satellite cells, the stem cells of adult skeletal muscle, but results from an increased propensity for stem-cell self-renewal rather than progression through the myogenic program.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG repeat in the 3' untranslated region of a putative protein kinase (DMPK). To elucidate the role of DMPK in DM pathogenesis we have developed Dmpk deficient (Dmpk-/-) mice. Dmpk-/-mice develop a late-onset, progressive skeletal myopathy that shares some pathological features with DM. Muscles from mature mice show variation in fibre size, increased fibre degeneration and fibrosis. Adult Dmpk-/-mice show ultrastructural changes in muscle and a 50% decrease in force generation compared to young mice. Our results indicate that DMPK may be necessary for the maintenance of skeletal muscle structure and function and suggest that a decrease in DMPK levels may contribute to DM pathology.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is commonly associated with CTG repeat expansions within the gene for DM-protein kinase (DMPK). The effect of altered expression levels of DMPK, which is ubiquitously expressed in all muscle cell lineages during development, was examined by disrupting the endogenous Dmpk gene and overexpressing a normal human DMPK transgene in mice. Nullizygous (-/-) mice showed only inconsistent and minor size changes in head and neck muscle fibres at older age, animals with the highest DMPK transgene expression showed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and enhanced neonatal mortality. However, both models lack other frequent DM symptoms including the fibre-type dependent atrophy, myotonia, cataract and male-infertility. These results strengthen the contention that simple loss- or gain-of-expression of DMPK is not the only crucial requirement for development of the disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The muscle myosins and hexomeric proteins consisting of two heavy chains and two pairs of light chains, the latter called essential (ELC) and regulatory (RLC). The light chains stabilize the long alpha helical neck of the myosin head. Their function in striated muscle, however, is only partially understood. We report here the identification of distinct missense mutations in a skeletal/ventricular ELC and RLC, each of which are associated with a rare variant of cardiac hypertrophy as well as abnormal skeletal muscle. We show that myosin containing the mutant ELC has abnormal function, map the mutant residues on the three-dimensional structure of myosin and suggest that the mutations disrupt the stretch activation response of the cardiac papillary muscles.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Carnitine is an essential cofactor for oxidation of mitochondrial fatty acids. Carnitine deficiency results in failure of energy production by mitochondria and leads to metabolic encephalopathy, lipid-storage myopathy, and cardiomyopathy. The juvenile visceral steatosis (JVS) mouse, an animal model of systematic carnitine deficiency, inherits the JVS phenotype in autosomal recessive fashion, through a mutant allele mapped to mouse chromosome 11. As a step toward identifying the gene responsible for JVS by positional cloning, we attempted to refine the jvs locus in the mouse by detailed linkage analysis with 13 microsatellite markers, using 190 backcross progeny. Among the 13 loci tested, 5 (defined by markers D11Mit24, D11Mit111, D11Nds9, D11Mit86, and D11Mit23) showed no recombination, with a maximum lod score of 52.38. Our results implied that the jvs gene can be sought on mouse chromosome 11 within a genetic distance no greater than about 1.6 cM.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Point mutations in the genes encoding the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunits have been recognized in some patients with slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS). Clinical, electrophysiological, and pathological differences between these patients may be due to the distinct effects of individual mutations. We report that a spontaneous mutation of the beta subunit that interrupts the leucine ring of the AChR channel gate causes an eightfold increase in channel open time and a severe CMS characterized by severe endplate myopathy and extensive remodeling of the postsynaptic membrane. The pronounced abnormalities in neuromuscular synaptic architecture and function, muscle fiber damage and weakness, resulting from a single point mutation are a dramatic example of a mutation having a dominant gain of function and of hereditary excitotoxicity.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>X-linked recessive myotubular myopathy (MTM1) is characterized by severe hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness, with impaired maturation of muscle fibres. We have restricted the candidate region to 280 kb and characterized two candidate genes using positional cloning strategies. The presence of frameshift or missense mutations (of which two are new mutations) in seven patients proved that one of these genes is indeed implicated in MTM1. The protein encoded by the MTM1 gene is highly conserved in yeast, which is surprising for a muscle specific disease. The protein contains the consensus sequence for the active site of tyrosine phosphatases, a wide class of proteins involved in signal transduction. At least three other genes, one located within 100 kb distal from the MTM1 gene, encode proteins with very high sequence similarities and define, together with the MTM1 gene, a new family of putative tyrosine phosphatases in man.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Barth syndrome is a severe inherited disorder, often fatal in childhood, characterized by cardiac and skeletal myopathy, short stature and neutropenia. The disease has been mapped to a very gene-rich region in distal portion of Xq28. We now report the identification of unique mutations in one of the genes in this region, termed G4.5, expressed at high level in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Different mRNAs can be produced by alternative splicing of the primary G4.5 transcript, encoding novel proteins that differ at the N terminus and in the central region. The mutations introduce stop codons in the open reading frame interrupting translation of most of the putative proteins (which we term 'tafazzins'). Our results suggest that G4.5 is the genetic locus responsible for the Barth syndrome.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In order to further our understanding of the biological role of desmin, the muscle-specific intermediate filament protein, a null mutation in the desmin gene was introduced into the germ line of mice. Despite the complete lack of desmin, these mice developed and reproduced. Since we show that skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles form in the Des-/-mice, it is reasonable to propose that desmin is not essential for myogenic commitment or for myoblast fusion or differentiation in vivo. However, morphological abnormalities were observed in the diaphragm of adult mice; these were demonstrated by disorganized, distended, and nonaligned fibers. The heart presented areas of hemorrhaging in which fibrosis and ischemia were observed. We have also shown that the absence of desmin produces specific defects in smooth muscles. In conclusion, our results have demonstrated that desmin is not required for the differentiation of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscles but is essential to strengthen and maintain the integrity of these tissues.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an important cause of sudden death in apparently healthy young individuals. In less than half of kindreds with HCM, the disease is linked to the beta-myosin heavy-chain gene locus (MYH7). We have recently described two missense MYH7 gene mutations [Arg-403 to Gln (R403Q) and Leu-908 to Val (L908V)] and found that the mutant message is present in skeletal muscle soleus) and that the mutant beta-myosin obtained from soleus muscle has abnormal in vitro motility activity. Having identified a second kindred with the R403Q mutation, and 3 other kindreds with two additional mutations (G741R and G256E), we performed histochemical analysis of soleus muscle biopsies from 25 HCM patients with one of these four mutations. Light microscopic examination of the NADH-stained biopsies revealed the presence of central core disease (CCD) of skeletal muscle, a rare autosomal dominant nonprogressive myopathy characterized by a predominance of type I "slow" fibers and an absence of mitochondria in the center of many type I fibers. CCD was present in 10 of 13 patients with the L908V mutation, 5 of 8 patients with the R403Q mutation, 1 of 3 patients with the G741R mutation, and 1 patient with the G256E mutation. Mild-to-moderate myopathic changes with muscle fiber hypertrophy were present in 16 patients. Notably, CCD was present in 2 adults and 3 children with the L908V mutation who did not have cardiac hypertrophy. In contrast, soleus muscle samples from 5 patients from 4 kindreds in which HCM was not linked to the MYH7 locus showed no myopathy or CCD. Soleus muscle biopsies from 5 control subjects also showed normal histology. This work demonstrates that (i) MYH7-associated HCM is often a disease of striated muscle but with predominant cardiac involvement and (ii) a subset of HCM patients with MYH7 gene missense mutations have CCD.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Central core disease (CCD) of muscle is an inherited myopathy which is closely associated with malignant hyperthermia (MH) in humans. CCD has recently been shown to be tightly linked to the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) and mutations in this gene are known to be present in MH. Mutation screening of RYR1 has led to the identification of two previously undescribed mutations in different CCD pedigrees. One of these mutations was also detected in an unrelated MH pedigree whose members are asymptomatic of CCD. The data suggest a model to explain how a single mutation may result in two apparently distinct clinical phenotypes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Central core disease (CCD) is a morphologically distinct, autosomal dominant myopathy with variable clinical features. A close association with malignant hyperthermia (MH) has been identified. Since MH and CCD genes have been linked to the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) gene, cDNA sequence analysis was used to search for a causal RYR1 mutation in a CCD individual. The only amino acid substitution found was an Arg2434His mutation, resulting from the substitution of A for G7301. This mutation was linked to CCD with a lod score of 4.8 at a recombinant fraction of 0.0 in 16 informative meioses in a 130 member family, suggesting a causal relationship to CCD.</rdfs:comment>

The proposal tested was that differences in the amount or distribution of bFGF in muscles of the 3 species, might correlate with the limited muscle regeneration seen in humans and dogs afflicted with x-linked muscular dystrophy, in contrast with the sustained new muscle formation in mdx mice with the homologous myopathy. There was a striking difference between the species in the binding of bFGF antibodies to extracellular matrix, particularly at the periphery of myofibres; binding was pronounced in mouse but weak or absent in human and dog muscle. Binding to muscle nuclei and sarcoplasm was also stronger in mice than in humans and dogs, and in all species was more pronounced in foetal than adult muscle. Increased binding of bFGF antibodies was seen in damaged and regenerating muscle cells in all myopathic specimens where these were present. This was associated with the regenerative process rather than with myopathy, as a similar pattern of bFGF expression was seen in mouse muscle regenerating after experimental crush injury. The higher extracellular staining for bFGF around the periphery of mouse myofibres correlated with the successful muscle regeneration in dystrophic mice. Results suggest that bFGF at the fibre periphery might stimulate a local increase in the numbers of muscle precursor cells which can respond to injury in the mdx mouse.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and the myopathy seen in the mdx mouse both result from absence of the protein dystrophin. Structural similarities between dystrophin and other cytoskeletal proteins, its enrichment at myotendinous junctions, and its indirect association with laminin mediated by a transmembrane glycoprotein complex suggest that one of dystrophin's functions in normal muscle is to form one of the links between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Unlike Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients, mdx mice suffer only transient muscle necrosis, and are able to regenerate damaged muscle tissue. The present study tests the hypothesis that mdx mice partially compensate for dystrophin's absence by upregulating one or more dystrophin-independent mechanisms of cytoskeleton-membrane association. Quantitative analysis of immunoblots of adult mdx muscle samples showed an increase of approximately 200% for vinculin and talin, cytoskeletal proteins that mediate thin filament-membrane interactions at myotendinous junctions. Blots also showed an increase (143%) in the dystrophin-related protein called utrophin, another myotendinous junction constituent, which may be able to substitute for dystrophin directly. Muscle samples from 2-week-old animals, a period immediately preceding the onset of muscle necrosis, showed no significant differences in protein concentration between mdx and controls. Quantitative analyses of confocal images of myotendinous junctions from mdx and control muscles show significantly higher concentrations of talin and vinculin at the myotendinous junctions of mdx muscle. These findings indicate that mdx mice may compensate in part for the absence of dystrophin by increased expression of other molecules that subsume dystrophin's mechanical function.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mitochondrial long chain fatty acid beta-oxidation provides the major source of energy in the heart. Deficiencies of human beta-oxidation enzymes produce sudden, unexplained death in childhood, acute hepatic encephalopathy, skeletal myopathy, or cardiomyopathy. Long chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase [LCHAD; long-chain-(S)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.211] catalyzes the third step in beta-oxidation, and this activity is present on the C-terminal portion of the alpha subunit of mitochondrial trifunctional protein. We used single-stranded conformation variance analysis of the exons of the human LCHAD (alpha subunit) gene to determine the molecular basis of LCHAD deficiency in three families with children presenting with sudden unexplained death or hypoglycemia and abnormal liver enzymes (Reye-like syndrome). In all families, the mothers had acute fatty liver and associated sever complications during pregnancies with the affected infants. The analysis in two affected children revealed a G to C mutation at position 1528 (G1528C) of the alpha subunit of the trifunctional protein on both alleles. This is in the LCHAD domain and substitutes glutamine for glutamic acid at position 474 of mature alpha subunit. The third child had this G1528C mutation on one allele and a different mutation (C1132T) creating a premature termination codon (residue 342) on the second allele. Our results demonstrate that mutations in the LCHAD domain of the trifunctional protein alpha subunit in affected offspring are associated with maternal acute fatty liver of pregnancy. This is the initial delineation of the molecular basis of isolated LCHAD deficiency.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) has been shown to be mutated in a small number of malignant hyperthermia (MH) pedigrees. Missense mutations in this gene have also been identified in two families with central core disease (CCD), a rare myopathy closely associated with MH. In an effort to identify other RYR1 mutations responsible for MH and CCD, we used a SSCP approach to screen the RYR1 gene for mutations in a family exhibiting susceptibility to MH (MHS) where some of the MHS individuals display core regions in their muscle. Sequence analysis of a unique aberrant SSCP has allowed us to identify a point mutation cosegregating with MHS in the described family. The mutation changes a conserved tyrosine residue at position 522 to a serine residue. This mutation is positioned relatively close to five of the six MHS/CCD mutations known to date and provides further evidence that MHS/CCD mutations may cluster in the amino terminal region of the RYR1 protein.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Human phosphofructokinase (PFK) is a tetrameric enzyme, encoded by muscle, liver, and platelet genes. Deficiency of muscle PFK (PFK-M), glycogenosis type VII (Tarui disease), is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by an exertional myopathy and hemolytic syndrome. Several disease-causing mutations have been identified in the PFK-M gene in Japanese, Ashkenazi Jewish, and Italian patients. We describe the genetic defects in French Canadian and Swiss patients with the disease, and we use a genetically well-defined yeast system devoid of endogenous PFK for structure-function studies of the mutant PFKs. A G-to-A transition at codon 209-in exon 8 of the PFK-M gene, changing an encoded Gly to Asp, is responsible for the disease in a homozygous French Canadian patient. Gly-209-mutated protein is completely inactive in the yeast system. The Swiss patient is a genetic compound, carrying a G-to-A transition at codon 100 in exon 6 (Arg to Gln) and a G-to-A transition at codon 696 in exon 22 (Arg to His). The mutants expressed in yeast generate functional enzyme with modest changes in thermal stability. The advantages and limitations of the yeast system for expression of human mutant PFKs are discussed.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mitochondrial Creatine Kinase (MtCK) is responsible for the transfer of high energy phosphate from mitochondria to the cytosolic carrier, creatine, and exists in mammals as two isoenzymes encoded by separate genes. In rats and humans, sarcomere-specific MtCK (sMtCK) is expressed only in skeletal and heart muscle, and has 87% nucleotide identity across the 1257 bp coding region. The ubiquitous isoenzyme of MtCK (uMtCK) is expressed in many tissues with highest levels in brain, gut, and kidney, and has 92% nucleotide identity between the 1254 bp coding regions of rat and human. Both genes are highly regulated developmentally in a tissue-specific manner. There is virtually no expression of sMtCK mRNA prior to birth. Unlike cytosolic muscle CK (MCK) and brain CK (BCK), there is no developmental isoenzyme switch between the MtCKs. Cell culture models representing the tissue-specific expression of either sMtCK or uMtCK are available, but there are no adequate developmental models to examine their regulation. Several animal models are available to examine the coordinate regulation of the CK gene family and include 1) Cardiac Stress by coarctation (sMtCK, BCK, and MCK), 2) Uterus and placenta during pregnancy (uMtCK and BCK), and 3) Diabetes and mitochondrial myopathy (sMtCK, BCK, and MCK). We report the details of these findings, and discuss the coordinate regulation of the genes necessary for high-energy transduction.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Adhalin is deficient in two forms of human muscular dystrophy, one due to mutations in the adhalin gene and one linked to an unidentified gene on chromosome 13. Because adhalin is deficient in skeletal and cardiac muscles of BIO 14.6 hamsters, which experience both myopathy and cardiomyopathy, cDNA encoding adhalin from BIO 14.6 hamster skeletal muscle was cloned and sequenced. Adhalin mRNA was expressed at normal levels in BIO 14.6 hamster cardiac muscle, and no mutation in adhalin coding sequence was found, indicating that the inherited myopathy and cardiomyopathy of the BIO 14.6 hamster are most likely not due to mutations in the adhalin gene.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A range of tissue types has now been targeted for development of gene therapeutic procedures both to correct genetic defects and to treat acquired disease. In particular, skeletal muscle holds great importance, not exclusively for the treatment of inherited muscle disorders but also as a platform for the expression of heterologous recombinant proteins, destined to immunise the host or to serve some systemic therapeutic goal. With respect to the X-linked myopathy Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), several gene therapy protocols are being developed that focus on complementing primary genetic defects in the DMD gene by introducing copies of recombinant gene constructs into muscle cells both ex vivo and in vivo. In the present study the potential use of a range of polycationic liposomes as physical gene delivery systems for skeletal muscle has been examined. Using a LacZ reporter gene under optimised conditions up to 40% transfection efficiencies were obtained with the mouse myoblast cell line C2C12. With primary cultures of normal and dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse muscle, up to 10% transfection efficiency was obtained with reporter gene constructs, and high levels of recombinant human dystrophin expression were observed following transfer of dystrophin cDNA gene constructs. These in vitro studies indicate that cationic liposomes can be used to deliver recombinant genes to muscle cells at high efficiency and form a basis to expand investigations into in vivo expression of recombinant dystrophin protein either by direct intramuscular gene transfer or via implantation of transfected myoblasts.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Nemaline myopathies are diseases characterized by the presence in muscle fibres of pathognomonic rod bodies. These are composed largely of alpha-actinin and actin. We have identified a missense mutation in the alpha-tropomyosin gene, TPM3, which segregates completely with the disease in a family whose autosomal dominant nemaline myopathy we had previously localized to chromosome 1p13-q25. The mutation substitutes an arginine residue for a highly conserved methionine in a putative actin-binding site near the N terminus of the alpha-tropomyosin. The mutation may strengthen tropomyosin - actin binding, leading to rod body formation, by adding a further basic residue to the postulated actin-binding motif.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Duchenne's dystrophy (DMD), a recessive chromosome X-related disease, is the most common and severe form of myopathy. The different theories (vascular, neurogenic, membraneous, calcic and auto-immune) formulated to account for this disease have not been swept away by the discovery of the DMD gene and the deficient protein, dystrophin, since the exact cellular role played by the latter is still unknown. Our work on skeletal muscle has demonstrated a mitochondrial deficiency of the calcium-specific protein, calmitine, in degenerating muscle of myopathic persons and animals. Considering its great affinity for calcium, this protein specific to skeletal muscle could be essential to mitochondrial calcium regulation and thus to the functioning of the entire muscle cell. Its deficiency in Duchenne's and Becker type muscular dystrophy could be due to a mitochondrial genome alteration solely accountable for muscular degeneration. This hypothesis challenges the supposedly essential but still undefined role that researchers have attributed to dystrophin.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In extrahepatic tissues lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolyzes triglycerides thereby generating FFA for tissue uptake and metabolism. To study the effects of increased FFA uptake in muscle tissue, transgenic mouse lines were generated with a human LPL minigene driven by the promoter of the muscle creatine kinase gene. In these mice human LPL was expressed in skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle, but not in other tissues. In proportion to the level of LPL overexpression, decreased plasma triglyceride levels, elevated FFA uptake by muscle tissue, weight loss, and premature death were observed in three independent transgenic mouse lines. The animals developed a severe myopathy characterized by muscle fiber degeneration, fiber atrophy, glycogen storage, and extensive proliferation of mitochondria and peroxisomes. This degree of proliferation suggests that FFA play an important role in the biogenesis of these organelles. Our experiments indicate that LPL is rate limiting for the supply of muscle tissue with triglyceride-derived FFA. Improper regulation of muscle LPL can lead to major pathological changes and may be important in the pathogenesis of some human myopathies. Muscle-specific LPL transgenic mouse lines will serve as a useful animal model for the investigation of myopathies and the biogenesis of mitochondria and peroxisomes.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes the first step of glycogen catabolism. Hereditary defects of muscle phosphorylase lead to a myopathy characterized by exercise intolerance, cramps, and myoglobinuria (McArdle's disease). We have identified ten mutations in the myophosphorylase gene in patients with McArdle's disease. Relatively common mutations include: a nonsense mutation, CGA(Arg) to TGA at codon 49, observed in 30 of 40 American patients; deletion of a single codon 708/709, observed in 4 of 7 Japanese patients; and a missense mutation, GGC(Gly) to AGC(Ser) at codon 204, observed in 5 of 40 American patients. Apparently rare mutations include: a splice-junction mutation, G to A, at the first nt of intron 14; a deletion of G at codon 510; a mutation, ATG to CTG, in the translation initiation codon; and missense mutations, AAG(Lys) to ACG(Thr) at codon 542, CTG(Leu) to CCG(Pro) at codon 396, CTG(Leu) to CCG(Pro) at codon 291, and GAG(Glu) to AAG(Lys) at codon 654. As most mutations can be screened for using genomic DNA, patients can now be diagnosed reliably using peripheral blood cells, thus avoiding muscle biopsy. Although these findings define the wide spectrum of genetic lesions causing McArdle's disease, the clinical heterogeneity of this disorder remains to be explained.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Hypothyroidism (induced by 8 weeks of oral 0.05% propylthiouracil) heightened the phenotype of mdx mouse dystrophin-deficient myopathy to more closely resemble human Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Muscle repair after crush injury to the tibialis anterior muscle (TA) in hypothyroid mdx mice showed decreased myotube formation and delayed debris removal. To investigate whether reduced muscle precursor cell proliferation can account for the effects of hypothyroidism on repair from injury, immunocytochemistry for neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) on muscle precursor cells and autoradiography to detect DNA synthesis were performed in control and mdx TA. The proportions of labelled polymorphonuclear leukocyte nuclei (PMN), myotube nuclei (MN), and total mononuclear cell nuclei (TLN, the majority being muscle precursors) were counted in defined areas of regenerating TA after 2 and 4 days recovery. MN and the numbers of activated satellite cell nuclei on intact fibers were counted in surviving areas. In the same muscle, earlier phases of regeneration were observed in areas distal than proximal to the injury. At 2 days of regeneration, labelled PMN were increased in treated compared with untreated mdx TA. In distal areas at 4 days, fewer muscle precursors had recently fused to myotubes in treated than in untreated mdx. In proximal areas 4 days (relatively late in repair), TLN data suggested that muscle precursor proliferation was greater in hypothyroid compared with untreated mdx TA. NCAM immunostaining was consistent with proliferation data and confirmed that there were more muscle precursors in mdx than in control regenerating muscle. These results suggest that hypothyroidism prolongs and increases the phase of replication by mdx muscle precursors and delays precursor fusion into myotubes in regeneration.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dystrophin-deficient female mdx mice were bred with male Tsk+/+ pa mice to examine the role played by mast cells in the pathophysiology of dystrophin deficiency. Resultant mdx/Tsk double-mutant mice were then examined functionally, biochemically, and histologically. While mdx mice remained as strong as their normal counterparts, mdx/Tsk double-mutant mice became progressively weak with age. Serum creatine kinase activity was significantly elevated in both mdx and mdx/Tsk double-mutant mice over normal controls. However, mast cell-derived plasma tryptase activity was consistently higher in the double-mutant than in mdx mice. In addition, histological examination of gastrocnemius muscle revealed that while necrosis was persistent in both strains of mdx mice from 2 to 8 weeks of age, regeneration was significantly reduced in the double-mutant mice. Of particular interest was the fact that necrosis in the mdx/Tsk double mutant exceeded mdx values at 8 weeks of age, corresponding approximately with a second peak in tryptase activity. Therefore, heightened mast cell activity appears to elicit in the dystrophin-deficient mdx mouse a myopathy not unlike the human Duchenne disease.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the muscle phosphofructokinase gene (PFK-M) result in a metabolic myopathy characterized by exercise intolerance and compensated hemolysis. PFK deficiency, glycogenosis type VII (Tarui disease) is a rare, autosomal, recessively inherited disorder. Multiple mutations, including splicing defects, frameshifts, and missense mutations, have recently been identified in patients from six different ethnic backgrounds establishing genetic heterogeneity of the disease. There is no obvious correlation between the genotype and phenotypic expression of the disease. PFK-M deficiency appears to be prevalent among people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Molecular diagnosis is now feasible for Ashkenazi patients who share two common mutations in the gene; the more frequent is an exon 5 splicing defect, which accounts for approximately 68% of mutant alleles in this population.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>In a congenital myasthenic syndrome with a severe endplate myopathy, patch-clamp studies revealed markedly prolonged acetylcholine receptor (AChR) channel openings. Molecular genetic analysis of AChR subunit genes demonstrated a heterozygous adenosine-to-cytosine transversion at nucleotide 790 in exon 8 of the epsilon-subunit gene, predicting substitution of proline for threonine at codon 264 and no other mutations in the entire coding sequences of genes encoding the alpha, beta, delta, and epsilon subunits. Genetically engineered mutant AChR expressed in a human embryonic kidney fibroblast cell line also exhibited markedly prolonged openings in the presence of agonist and even opened in its absence. The Thr-264-->Pro mutation in the epsilon subunit involves a highly conserved residue in the M2 domain lining the channel pore and is likely to disrupt the putative M2 alpha-helix. Our findings indicate that a single mutation at a critical site can greatly alter AChR channel kinetics, leading to a congenital myasthenic syndrome. This observation raises the possibility that mutations involving subunits of other ligand-gated channels may also exist and be the basis of various other neurologic or psychiatric disorders.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>beta-Oxidation of long-chain fatty acids provides the major source of energy in the heart. Defects in enzymes of the beta-oxidation pathway cause sudden, unexplained death in childhood, acute hepatic encephalopathy or liver failure, skeletal myopathy, and cardiomyopathy. Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase [VLCAD; very-long-chain-acyl-CoA:(acceptor) 2,3-oxidoreductase, EC 1.3.99.13] catalyzes the first step in beta-oxidation. We have isolated the human VLCAD cDNA and gene and determined the complete nucleotide sequences. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of VLCAD mRNA and genomic exons defined the molecular defects in two patients with VLCAD deficiency who presented with unexplained cardiac arrest and cardiomyopathy. In one, a homozygous mutation in the consensus dinucleotide of the donor splice site (g+1-->a) was associated with universal skipping of the prior exon (exon 11). The second patient was a compound heterozygote, with a missense mutation, C1837-->T, changing the arginine at residue 613 to tryptophan on one allele and a single base deletion at the intron-exon 6 boundary as the second mutation. This initial delineation of human mutations in VLCAD suggests that VLCAD deficiency reduces myocardial fatty acid beta-oxidation and energy production and is associated with cardiomyopathy and sudden death in childhood.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Mutations in the human phosphofructokinase muscle subunit gene (PFKM) are known to cause myopathy classified as glycogenosis type VII (Tarui disease). Previously described molecular defects include base substitutions altering encoded amino acids or resulting in abnormal splicing. We report a mutation resulting in phosphofructokinase deficiency in three patients from an Ashkenazi Jewish family. Using a reverse transcription PCR assay, PFKM subunit transcripts differing by length were detected in skeletal muscle tissue of all three affected subjects. In the longer transcript, an insertion of 252 nucleotides totally homologous to the structure of the 10th intron of the PFKM gene was found separating exon 10 from exon 11. In addition, two single base transitions were identified by direct sequencing: [exon 6; codon 95; CGA (Arg) to TGA (stop)] and [exon 7; codon 172; ACC (Thr) to ACT (Thr)] in either transcript. Single-stranded conformational polymorphism and restriction enzyme analyses confirmed the presence of these point substitutions in genomic DNA and strongly suggested homozygosity for the pathogenic allele. The nonsense mutation at codon 95 appeared solely responsible for the phenotype in these patients, further expanding genetic heterogeneity of Tarui disease. Transcripts with and without intron 10 arising from identical mutant alleles probably resulted from differential pre-mRNA processing and may represent a novel message from the PFKM gene.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A 14-year-old boy had myoglobinuria and renal failure after intense exercise; a year earlier he had experienced a milder episode. There was no consanguinity and no family history of neuromuscular diseases or hemolytic anemia. Strength was normal. Forearm ischemic exercise caused prolonged contracture with no rise of venous lactate. Muscle morphology showed only a mild increase of lipid droplets. Glycogen concentration was normal. Muscle phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) activity was 5% of the normal mean, and all other glycolytic enzymes were normal. The residual PGK activity of muscle was heat stable but showed slower than normal electrophoretic mobility and decreased Michaelis constants for 3-phosphoglycerate and adenosine triphosphate. The enzyme defect was also expressed in erythrocytes and in fibroblast and muscle cultures. PGK activity was decreased in tissues from the patient's mother but normal in the father. PGK deficiency is an X-linked recessive trait usually associated with hemolytic anemia, mental retardation, and seizures; myopathy had not been recognized previously. Muscle PGK deficiency is now added to two other newly recognized glycolytic defects, phosphoglycerate mutase and lactate dehydrogenase deficiencies, as a cause of recurrent myoglobinuria.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The existence of a five-membered isozyme system for human phosphofructokinase (PFK; ATP:D-fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.11) has been demonstrated. These multimolecular forms result from the random polymerization of two distinct subunits, M (muscle type) and L (liver type), to form all possible tetrameters-i.e., M(4), M(3)L, M(2)L(2), ML(3), and L(4). Partially purified muscle and liver PFKs were hybridized by dissociation at low pH and then recombination at neutrality. Three hybrid species were generated in addition to the two parental isozymes, to yield an entire five-membered set. The various species could be consistently and reproducibly separated from one another by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography at pH 8.0 with a concave elution gradient of salt. Under similar experimental conditions, erythrocyte PFK from hemolysates was also resolved into five species chromatographically indistinguishable from those produced in the above experiment. Immunological and kinetic studies of the isozymes provided corroborative evidence to support the proposed subunit structures. Erythrocyte PFK was found to have kinetic properties intermediate between those of muscle and liver PFK and was neutralized only 50% by an antiserum against muscle PFK that completely neutralized muscle PFK. These data demonstrate that muscle and liver PFKs are distinct homotetramers-i.e., M(4) and L(4), respectively-whereas erythrocyte PFK is a heterogeneous mixture of all five isozymes. The structural heterogeneity of erythrocyte PFK provides a molecular genetic basis for the differential organ involvement observed in some inherited PFK deficiency states in which myopathy or hemolysis or both can occur.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Normal human erythrocyte phosphofructokinase (ATP: D-fructose-6, P-1-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.11; PFK) has recently been shown to consist of a heterogeneous mixture of five tetrameric isozymes: M4, M3L, M2L2, ML3, and L4 (M, muscle type; L, liver type). In the light of these findings, we have investigated the molecular basis of the inherited erythrocyte PFK deficiency associated with myopathy and hemolysis (Tarui disease). The propositus, a 31-yr-old male, suffered from muscle weakness and myoglobinuria on exertion. He showed mild erythrocytosis despite laboratory evidence of hemolysis. In his erythrocytes a metabolic crossover point was found at the level of PFK; 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) was also significantly reduced. The PFK from the patient's erythrocytes consisted exclusively of the L4 isozyme, and there was a complete absence of the other four. The leukocyte and platelet PFKs from the patient showed normal activities, chromatographic profiles, and precipitation with anti-M4 antibody. These studies provide direct evidence that in Tarui disease the M-type subunits are absent; but the liver- and platelet-type subunits of PFK are unaffected. The paradox of mild erythrocytosis despite hemolysis reflects the decreased production of 2,3-DPG.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Muscle phosphoglycerate mutase activity was decreased (5.7 percent of the lowest control value) in a 52-year-old man with intolerance for strenuous exercise and recurrent pigmenturia since adolescence. All of the other enzymes of glycolysis had normal activities, and glycogen concentration was normal. Electrophoretic, heat lability, and mercury inhibition studies showed that the small residual activity in the patient's muscle was represented by the brain (BB) isoenzyme of phosphoglycerate mutase, suggesting a genetic defect of the M subunit which predominates in normal muscle. The prevalence of the BB isoenzyme in other tissues, including muscle culture, may explain why symptoms were confined to muscle.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Human phosphofructokinase (PFK; EC 2.7.1.11) exists in tetrameric isozymic forms. Muscle and liver contain the homotetramers M4 and L4, whereas erythrocytes contain five isozymes composed of M (muscle) and L (liver) subunits, i.e., M4, M3L, M2L2, ML3, and L4. Inherited defects of erythrocyte PFK are usually partial and are described in association with heterogeneous clinical syndromes. To define the molecular basis and pathogenesis of this enzymopathy, we investigated four unrelated individuals manifesting myopathy and hemolysis (glycogenosis type VII), isolated hemolysis, or no symptoms at all. The three symptomatic patients showed high-normal hemoglobin levels, despite hemolysis and early-onset hyperuricemia. They showed total lack of muscle-type PFK and suffered from exertional myopathy of varying severity. In the erythrocytes, a metabolic crossover was evident at the PFK step: the levels of hexose monophosphates were elevated and those of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) were depressed, causing strikingly increased hemoglobin-oxygen affinity. In all cases, the residual erythrocyte PFK consisted exclusively of L4 isozyme, indicating homozygosity for the deficiency of the catalytically active M subunit. However, presence of immunoreactive M subunit was shown in cultured fibroblasts by indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal anti-M antibody. The fourth individual was completely asymptomatic, had normal erythrocyte metabolism, and had no evidence of hemolysis. His residual erythrocyte PFK showed a striking decrease of the L4, ML3, and M2L2 isozymes, secondary to a mutant unstable L subunit. Identical alterations of erythrocyte PFK were found in his asymptomatic son, indicating heterozygosity for the mutant unstable L subunit in this kindred. These studies show that, except for the varying severity of the myopathic symptoms, glycogenosis type VII has highly uniform clinical and biochemical features and results from homozygosity for mutant inactive M subunit(s). The absence of anemia despite hemolysis may be explained by the low 2,3-DPG levels. The hyperuricemia may result from hyperactivity of the hexose monophosphate shunt. In contrast, the clinically silent carrier state results from heterozygosity for mutant M or L subunit. Of the two, the M subunit appears to be more critical for adequate glycolytic flux in the erythrocyte, since its absence is correlated with hemolysis.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Two Japanese siblings had lipid storage myopathy with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). They had slowly progressive muscle weakness and ventricular hypertrophy of the heart evidenced by electrocardiography and echocardiography. Their developmental milestones were normal until three years of age when mild weakness in the lower limbs became evident. Laboratory examination showed transient high creatine kinase levels (CK) and hyperammonemia. Histochemical investigation on the muscles revealed abnormal accumulation of sudanophilic lipid droplets predominantly in type 1 fibers, type 2 A fiber atrophy and type 2 B fiber deficiency. In case 1, excessive lipid droplets were also observed in the biopsied cardiac muscle. Carnitine was decreased in the skeletal muscles and the serum. Treatment with DL-carnitine to both cases resulted in marked clinical improvement and decreased lipid droplets in the muscles.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Lack of muscle glycogen phosphorylase activity leads to McArdle's disease, a rare metabolic myopathy. To investigate its molecular basis at the nucleic acid level, we isolated muscle phosphorylase cDNA clones from a human cDNA library in Escherichia coli plasmid pBR 322. Subcloning of one insertion of M13 bacteriophage permitted its definite identification by sequencing. Northern blot experiments revealed one specific messenger RNA of 3.4 kilobases found uniquely in tissues expressing muscle phosphorylase. We show that McArdle's disease exhibits a molecular heterogeneity at the messenger RNA level. In eight unrelated cases of McArdle's disease in which no inactive proteins had been detected, we assayed muscle biopsies for phosphorylase mRNA by Northern blotting. In five cases, no muscle phosphorylase mRNA could be detected, while in three other cases, normal length mRNA was present in lower amounts. Moreover, Southern blot analysis of DNA isolated from white blood cells in four McArdle patients revealed no major deletion or rearrangements of the phosphorylase gene as compared with controls.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Skeletal muscle has been examined in a colony of the mdx strain of myopathic mice. Sixty-five mice from 22 to 303 days of age, showed extensive and recurrent areas of necrosis and regeneration of muscle fibres, often accompanied by active cellular infiltration. Morphometry of the soleus muscle revealed an abnormal proportion of small and large muscle fibres; over half of the muscle fibres contained 'central' (non-peripheral) nuclei. No histochemical muscle fibre-type grouping was detected. Serum activities of muscle-derived enzymes were greatly elevated in all animals and probably reflect enzyme leakage from damaged muscle fibres. Histological evidence of a cardiomyopathy was found in 13 mice. The mdx myopathy thus shows features seen in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Mdx differs from Duchenne dystrophy principally in that it exhibits a greater degree of compensatory muscle regeneration and an absence of fibro-fatty replacement of muscle fibres.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The yeast box-mutant W7 exhibits deficiencies in cytochrome b and in nuclear coded complex III subunits, a phenotype observed previously in a patient with mitochondrial myopathy. DNA sequence analysis of mutant W7 revealed a single base transition in the cytochrome b gene; the mutated residue Gly 131 is perfectly conserved in all known cytochromes b and belongs to the Qo domain. Mutant W7 provides a model system for evaluating the action of therapeutic agents, such as vitamin K3 which restored NADH-oxidase activity in the mutant as well as in the antimycin-inhibited wild type. However, with the mutant, a greater quantity of menadione was necessary due to a decrease in other complex activities, and a much lower electron-flow fraction passed through cytochrome oxidase.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>The 24-kDa subunit of mitochondrial NADH-ubiquinone reductase (complex I) is an iron-sulfur protein that is present in the flavoprotein or NADH dehydrogenase II subcomplex. It is a nuclear gene product and is imported into the organelle. A group of human patients with mitochondrial myopathy have been shown to have reduced levels of subunits of complex I in skeletal muscle mitochondria, and in one patient the 24-kDa subunit appears to be absent (Schapira et al., 1988). To investigate the genetic basis of this type of myopathy, cDNA clones have been isolated from a bovine library derived from heart and liver mRNA by hybridization with two mixtures of 48 synthetic oligonucleotides 17 bases in length that were designed on the basis of known protein sequences. The recombinant DNA sequence has been determined, and it encodes a precursor of the mature 24-kDa protein. The N terminus of the mature protein is preceded by a presequence of 32 amino acids that has properties that are characteristic of mitochondrial import sequences. The sequence of the mature protein deduced from the cDNA contains a segment of nine amino acids that was not determined in an earlier partial protein sequence analysis. The bovine clone has been employed as a hybridization probe to identify cDNA clones of the human homologue of the 24-kDa protein. Its DNA sequence has also been determined, and it codes for a protein that is closely related to the bovine protein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>AMP deaminase is an ubiquitous enzyme in eukaryotic cells, and tissue-specific isoforms are produced in mammals by differential expression of the two genes which encode this enzyme activity as well as by alternative splicing of the primary transcript of one of these genes. Deficiency of this enzyme activity is one of the most common causes of metabolic myopathy in man. To provide a framework for understanding the molecular basis of this inherited disorder and the mechanisms responsible for regulating the expression of this enzyme activity, both the human and rat muscle-specific genes for AMP deaminase have been cloned and partially sequenced. Comparison of the two genes shows a high degree of conservation of sequence and structural organization. The two genes share the following characteristics: 1) both are approximately 20 kilobases in size, have identical exon/intron boundaries, and exhibit similar intron/exon structural organization; 2) the transcription start site is located at the same position in both genes, and comparison of 5'-flanking sequences reveals four highly conserved domains that together contain the information necessary for muscle-specific expression of a receptor cDNA; 3) coding sequences are 88% identical and the 5'-untranslated regions are 67% identical; 4) both genes have extremely short 3'-untranslated regions (13-17 nucleotides); 5) highly conserved intervening sequences of several hundred nucleotides surround most exon/intron boundaries. In situ hybridization and analysis of human-mouse somatic cell hybrids have localized the human gene (designated AMPD1) to chromosome 1 in the region p13-p21. The implications of these structural properties for identifying functional domains in the AMP deaminase peptide, regulation of expression of this gene, and inheritance of AMP deaminase deficiency are discussed.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A variable combination of developmental delay, retinitis pigmentosa, dementia, seizures, ataxia, proximal neurogenic muscle weakness, and sensory neuropathy occurred in four members of a family and was maternally transmitted. There was no histochemical evidence of mitochondrial myopathy. Blood and muscle from the patients contained two populations of mitochondrial DNA, one of which had a previously unreported restriction site for AvaI. Sequence analysis showed that this was due to a point mutation at nucleotide 8993, resulting in an amino acid change from a highly conserved leucine to arginine in subunit 6 of mitochondrial H(+)-ATPase. There was some correlation between clinical severity and the amount of mutant mitochondrial DNA in the patients; this was present in only small quantities in the blood of healthy elderly relatives in the same maternal line.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked progressive myopathy caused by a defect in the DMD gene locus. The gene corresponding to the DMD locus produces a 14-kilobase (kb) messenger RNA that codes for a large cytoskeletal membrane protein, dystrophin. DMD and Becker's muscular dystrophy are the consequences of dystrophin mutations. The exact biological function of dystrophin remains unknown but it has been demonstrated that it is localized to the cytoplasmic face of the cell membrane and has direct interaction with several other membrane proteins. We report here the synthesis of a 14-kb full-length complementary DNA for the mouse muscle dystrophin mRNA and the expression of this cDNA in COS cells. The recombinant dystrophin is indistinguishable from mouse muscle dystrophin by western blot analysis with anti-dystrophin antibodies and was shown by an immunofluorescent technique to be localized in the cell membrane. Our successful construction of a functional full-length cDNA opens opportunities for the study of structure and function of dystrophin and provides an opportunity to initiate gene therapy studies.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Dystrophin, the protein product of the gene responsible for X-linked muscular dystrophies, shares structural features with the cytoskeletal proteins spectrin and alpha-actinin. Like spectrin, it is localized at the cytoplasmic surface of the sarcolemma and is particularly concentrated in the subsynaptic region of the neuromuscular junction. Mdx mice have a profound deficiency of dystrophin and develop a necrotizing myopathy in the first weeks of life. Abnormalities of the neuromuscular junction, including a redistribution of postsynaptic molecules and reduction in synaptic folding, are also observed. We have studied these mice to see whether the lack of dystrophin has a specific effect on the structure and function of their neuromuscular junctions. Using a fore-limb muscle from 8 week old mdx mice we confirm the previously described postsynaptic structural changes and in addition show that many nerve terminals are abnormally complex. We demonstrate that these structural abnormalities are found exclusively at neuromuscular junctions on regenerated muscle fibres. Despite these structural abnormalities, miniature endplate potential frequency, the quantal content of endplate potentials, the amplitude and time course of miniature endplate currents and the number of acetylcholine receptors at the postsynaptic membrane are normal in mdx mice of this age. We conclude that in the mdx mouse the absence of dystrophin from the postsynaptic membrane has little direct effect on the function of the neuromuscular junction but that degeneration and regeneration of muscle fibres leads to remodelling of both its pre- and postsynaptic components.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>AMP deaminase (AMPD; EC 3.5.4.6) is encoded by a multigene family in mammals. The AMPD1 gene is expressed at high levels in skeletal muscle, where this enzyme is thought to play an important role in energy metabolism. Deficiency of AMPD activity in skeletal muscle is associated with symptoms of a metabolic myopathy. Eleven unrelated individuals with AMPD deficiency were studied, and each was shown to be homozygous for a mutant allele characterized by a C----T transition at nucleotide 34 (codon 12 in exon 2) and at nucleotide 143 (codon 48 in exon 3). The C----T transition at codon 12 results in a nonsense mutation predicting a severely truncated AMPD peptide. Consistent with this prediction, no immunoreactive AMPD1 peptide is detectable in skeletal muscle of these patients. This mutant allele is found in 12% of Caucasians and 19% of African-Americans, whereas none of the 106 Japanese subjects surveyed has this mutant allele. We conclude from these studies that this mutant allele is present at a sufficiently high frequency to account for the 2% reported incidence of AMPD deficiency in muscle biopsies. The restricted distribution and high frequency of this doubly mutated allele suggest it arose in a remote ancestor of individuals of Western European descent.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Myoadenylate deaminase (mAMPD) deficiency in a clinically heterogeous metabolic myopathy consisting of primary (inherited) and secondary (acquired) forms based on a variety of clinical and laboratory findings. To provide a basis for delineating the underlying molecular defects in mAMPD deficiency, and as a means to test the proposal for multiple forms of the resulting disease, Northern blot analyses were performed with RNA isolated from individual patients with classified primary and secondary deficiency utilizing human mAMPD cDNA probes isolated from adult skeletal muscle libraries. Analysis of nine patients with primary mAMPD deficiency indicates normal abundance of mAMPD transcript. No immunoreactive mAMPD polypeptide is detected in Western blot analyses of skeletal muscle extracts prepared from these patients. Specificity to mAMPD is demonstrated by normal creatine kinase (CK) activities and M-creatine kinase (M-CK) transcript abundance. Similar analyses of four individuals with secondary mAMPD deficiency reveal heterogeneity in this subgroup of patients. Whereas two of these patients exhibit normal mAMPD transcript abundance, two others associated with inflammatory myopathy display reductions in mAMPD and M-CK transcript abundance. Examination of tissue sections derived from the same biopsies utilized in the isolation of RNA demonstrates the integrity of the skeletal muscle in those patients with associated inflammatory myopathy. Combined, these data support the proposal for multiple forms of mAMPD deficiency, and indicate that the primary condition is most commonly characterized by specific point mutations or small deletions/rearrangements in the ampd1 gene, whereas some patients with secondary mAMPD deficiency display more generalized aberrations in gene expression.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>A new recessive mutation, myd, causing a diffuse and progressive myopathy in the mouse is described. Histopathological comparisons with normal littermates showed widely distributed focal lesions in all skeletal muscles of myd/myd. Body and organ weights of affected mice were considerably less than those of normal littermates and the mean lifespan of myodystrophic mice that survived weaning was 17 weeks with a range of 5 to 39 weeks. Myodystrophy is located on chromosome 8; it is linked to Os with about 6 percent and to Eso with about 37 percent recombination.</rdfs:comment>

<rdfs:comment>Rapid regeneration of mouse anterior tibial muscle occurs when minced muscle is explanted into the leg of a recipient previously prepared by excision of the corresponding anterior tibial muscle. This technique was used to study regeneration of muscle from mice with a delayed, recessive myopathy, motor endplate disease (MED). There was rapid regeneration of the explanted muscle and functional restoration after 15 weeks without signs of MED disease or evidence of the myofiber degeneration which normally occurs after 14 days in homozygous animals. Therefore, MED disease is not intrinsic in the affected muscles but appears to be dependent on the general humoral or possibly neural, environment present in mice with MED disease.</rdfs:comment>
